<sample><p n="ENG184001041">"I am not afraid of that, Sir Matthew; I know I may trust you. But I should like a bit of a memorandum about my own business, if you please."</p>
<p n="ENG184001042">"Quite right, quite right, sir. I am too much a man of business to object to that. Draw up the engagement, such as you wish it to be, and I dare say I shall make no objection to signing it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001043">After this a cordial hand-shaking was exchanged and the friends parted.</p>
<p n="ENG184001044">AN UNFORTUNATE RENCONTRE — AN ADVENTURE — MISS BROTHERTON GROWS WISER EVERY DAY.</p>
<p n="ENG184001045">Mrs. Tremlett's inquiries proved successful. Jim Sykes, the weeding-boy, knew perfectly well where widow Armstrong lived; and after he had repeated his instructions three times, Mary Brotherton and her unresisting chaperon set off on their expedition. On one point only did the self-willed heiress yeild to the judgment of her companion. Mary, who knew, that though she seldom went beyond the shelter of her own park-paling, she often walked without fatigue within it for two or three hours together, wished to set off for Hoxley-lane on foot; but Mrs. Tremlett talked so much of the fatigue, that the good-natured girl consented to let the carriage convey them to the point at which the lane diverged from the high-road. This yielding, however, was wholly from consideration for her companion. For herself she believed the precaution quite needless; and she was right. However much her temper might have been endangered by the series of spoiling processes she had undergone, her health had been taken good care of, and few girls of her age in any rank, had greater power and will for exertion than herself.</p>
<p n="ENG184001046">Nevertheless, before she had driven half a mile, she heartily rejoiced at having sacrificed her own inclination to that of her good nurse; for the road to Ashleigh was the favourite ride of the officers quartered in the neighbourhood, and had she been seen on foot, it is probable that before reaching Hoxley-lane she would have been surrounded by a body-guard of military. So greatly did this danger appal her spirits, that the frist moment she found herself free from a white-gloved hand either at one window or the other, she stopped the carriage, and ordered the coachman to go far enough down the lane to permit her to ge out unoberserved by any persons passing by the road.</p>
<p n="ENG184001047">But poor Mary was this day doomed to disappointment; and the indignant, and almost passionate beating of her heart under it, made her more conscious, perhaps, than she had ever been before, how deeply the business upon which she was engaged had entered into her soul.</p>
<p n="ENG184001048">Soon after Sir Matthew Dowling had dismissed his breakfast companion, he strolled out towards his splendid stables, and perceiving his son loitering among the grooms, and himself equipped for the saddle, he inquired whither he was going to ride. "Only to Ashleigh, governor," was the reply. "Then wait five minutes, Augustus, and I will ride with you."</p>
<p n="ENG184001049">Whether the youth approved the proposal or not, he was fain to submit to it, and the evil star of Mary Brotherton contrived to bring them to the top of Hoxley-lane at the moment her carriage was about to turn into it.</p>
<p n="ENG184001050">"Stop!" cried the young lady, accompanying the word with a very energetic pull at the check-string. "Go on to Ashleigh," was the order the followed.</p>
<p n="ENG184001051">"Was ever any thing so provoking, nurse? Do you see who those hateful men are?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001052">"Why 'tis Sir Matthew, my dear," replied the gentle old woman.</p>
<p n="ENG184001053">"The wretch!" muttered Mary between her teeth at the very moment that sir Matthew on one side, and his languishing son on the other, besieged her carriage.</p>
<p n="ENG184001054">"Not for my right hand would I have him guess where I am going," thought she, as with a face suffused with the deepest carmine that agitation could produce, she forced her lips into an unmeaning smile in return to their salutation.</p>
<p n="ENG184001055">The father and son came to exactly the same conclusion, and at the same moment. There was but one cause that it was possible to assign for her evident emotion.She was deeply in love with Augustus, — more deeply then even the young man himself had imagined. The thing was plain, no doubt remained, no not a shadow of it on the mind of either father or son, but it was the elder gentleman only who at once determined to push so fine a game to its close, with as little delay as possible.</p>
<p n="ENG184001056">Feeling quite sure that there was no liberty he could take at this moment which would not be welcome, he made a sign t the coachman to stop, and deliberately dismounting he threw his reins to his groom, told Miss Brotherton's footman to open the carriage-door, and stepped in with the assumed air of a partially loved friend, who knows that no leave need be asked.</p>
<p n="ENG184001057">Mary shrunk back into her corner with considerably more disgust than if a reptile had possessed itself of the seat opposite.</p>
<p n="ENG184001058">"This is not quite as it should be, is it?" said Sir Matthew, with a leer. "Perhaps so me other may have a better right here than I?" And a very expressive smile accompanied the words.</p>
<p n="ENG184001059">"Sir?" said Miss Brotherton.</p>
<p n="ENG184001060">"Come, come, my dear child, you must not look vexed at any of my little jokes. You know how we all dote upon you! Dear creature! How beautiful that sweet blush make you look! He, he! there goes poor Augustus looking very much as if he could wring his papa's neck off. But his turn, we will hope, may come by and by. and now, my dear, I'll tell you what I am come here for. We all want you, and your good Mrs. Tremlett too, if she likes it, to come over to us quite en famille to-morrow. I don't know what love-powder you have been scattering amongst us, but there is not a single individual of the family who does not positively dote upon you. Tell me my pretty Mary, do you feel a little kindness for some of us in return?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001061">An attempt to take her hand accompanied this speech; and Mrs. Tremlett, who estimated pretty nearly her young lady's affection for Sir Matthew and his race, actually trembled for the consequences. But, to her great surprise, Mary answered, after the pause of a minute, "Oh, dear Sir Matthew! you are only laughing at me!" in a voice so exceedingly chilldish and silly, that it might, under similar circumstances, have made the fortune of a comic actress; and though she did not permit him to touch the hand he attempted to take, she placed it, together with its fellow, so playfully behind her, that Sir Matthew could only laugh and call her, "dear pretty creature!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001062">Meanwhile the carriage proceeded to penetrate through the dirty dismal streets, which, in that direction, formed the suburb of Ashleigh.</p>
<p n="ENG184001063">"I must get out here," said Miss Brotherton, suddenly pulling the check-string.</p>
<p n="ENG184001064">"Here? Impossible, my dear child!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001065">"Nothing is impossible t me, that I choose to do, sir," said the young lady, springing to the ground the moment the door was opened. The knight was fain to follow, the animated Augustus threw himself from his horse at the same instant, and Mrs. Tremlett held herself suspended on the step of the carriage to learn what she was required to do.</p>
<p n="ENG184001066">"I wish to know what is the matter with these miserable-looking children," said Mary, approaching a half-open door, at each side of which, crouching on the stone step, sat a pale and squalid-looking girl. The eldest might be ten years old, the youngest was certainly not more than six.</p>
<p n="ENG184001067">"Gracious Heaven! you are not going to speak to those creatures, Miss Brotherton?" exclaimed Sir Matthew, while his son instinctively backed his horse into the middle of the street.</p>
<p n="ENG184001068">"And why not, Sir Matthew?" said Mary.</p>
<p n="ENG184001069">"You are not aware of what you are doing; I give you my honour you are not. You have no conception that these sort of creatures are. My dear, dear Miss Brotherton, get into your carriage — get into your carriage, I conjure you!</p>
<p n="ENG184001070">Mary looked at him, but said not a word in reply.</p>
<p n="ENG184001071">"What ails you, little girl?" said she, putting her hand upon the shoulder of the youngest child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001072">"Billy-roller," answered the little creature.</p>
<p n="ENG184001073">"The billy-roller smashed her," said the eldest girl,"but 'twas falling asleep against the machinery as lamed me."</p>
<p n="ENG184001074">"Are you mad, Miss Brotherton!" exclaimed Sir Matthew. "Surely, Mrs. Tremlett, you ought to prevent your young lady from exposing herself to such scenes as these."</p>
<p n="ENG184001075">"Good morning, Sir Matthew, do not let me detain you," said the heiress, suddenly assuming the tone and style of a woman of fashion who chose to have her own way. "These sick little creatures quite interest me. Besides, I must positively find out who Billy Roller is."</p>
<p n="ENG184001076">"It is an instrument used in the works, Miss Brotherton. You know not to what you are exposing yourself — fraud, filth, infection, drunkenness! I give you my sacred honour that I think you are very likely to be robbed and murdered if you approach the thresholds of such dwellings as these."</p>
<p n="ENG184001077">"I beg your pardon, Sir Matthew," replied the heiress, "but you must excuse me if I obstinately persevere in judging for myself; I know I am a spoiled child, neither more nor less; and as such you must either give me up or bear with me. Permit me to wish you good morning; I shall do more than approach the threshold of this dwelling — I shall enter it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001078">Having said this, she waited no further parley, but taking a ragged child in each hand set her little foot against the door which already stood ajar, pushed it open, and walked in.</p>
<p n="ENG184001079">Her first idea on looking round her was that perhaps Sir Matthew was in the right. Filth she saw; infection might lurk under it; and who could tell if fraud and drunkenness might not enter the moment after, to complete the group?</p>
<p n="ENG184001080">But there was little of selfishness and much of courage in the heart of Mary Brotherton, so she presently forgot every notion of personal danger, and was thus enabled to see things as they really were.</p>
<p n="ENG184001081">On one side of the small bare chamber, and in some degree sheltered by the door which opened against it, stood a rickety machine once intended for a bedstead. Two of the legs had given place to brickbats, and instead of a bed the unsteady frame now supported only a thin layer of very dirty straw, with the body of a dying female stretched upon it. The only other article of furniture in the room was an old deal box without a cover, but having a couple of planks, each about three feet long, laid across it; serving either for table or chairs as occasion might require. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, and the remnant of a window, were all alike begrimed with smoke and dirt.</p>
<p n="ENG184001082">It took not long to make this inventory, and having completed it, the young lady, still holding in each hand a staring child, turned towards the inhabitant of this miserable den, and said,</p>
<p n="ENG184001083">"Are you ill, my good woman?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001084">The being she addressed raised her heavy eyes, and in a voice so low as to be scarcely intelligible, answered "Yes."</p>
<p n="ENG184001085">"Have you no assistance, nobody to nurse you?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001086">"Nobody but these," pointing to the children.</p>
<p n="ENG184001087">"Has any doctor seen her?" demanded Mary of the eldest child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001088">"No ma'am," replied the little girl.</p>
<p n="ENG184001089">"And how long has she been ill?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001090">"Ever since she com'd from the mill."</p>
<p n="ENG184001091">"And how long is that?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001092">"A twelvemonth," said the little one.</p>
<p n="ENG184001093">"I don't know," said the elder.</p>
<p n="ENG184001094">"But, my poor children, you are not the only people that live with her, I suppose? Have you got any father?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001095">"Yes."</p>
<p n="ENG184001096">"Where is he?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001097">"At the mill."</p>
<p n="ENG184001098">"Have you got any body else belonging to you?" said Miss Brotherton, shuddering.</p>
<p n="ENG184001099">"There's Sophy, and Dick, and Grace," replied the eldest child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001100">"Where are they all?" again inquired Miss Brotherton.</p>
<p n="ENG184001101">"At the mill," was again the answer.</p>
<p n="ENG184001102">"Are Sophy and Grace grown up?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001103">"Sophy is," answered the child, "and Grace, almost."</p>
<p n="ENG184001104">"Then why do they not stay at home, one of them at least, to take care of this poor woman?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001105">"'Cause they mustn't. I 'tends mother."</p>
<p n="ENG184001106">"You are not big enough to take care of her, my poor child. Why don't you go to the factory, and let one of the bigger ones stay at home?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001107">"They won't have me now, 'cause of this." — and as she spake, the child held up a little shrivelled right-hand, three fingers of which had a joint deficient. "I can't piece now, and so they won't let me come."</p>
<p n="ENG184001108">"And Sophy won't let me go, 'cause of this," said the little one, slipping her arm out of a bedgown (which was the only garment she had), and displaying the limb swollen and discoloured, from some violent contusion.</p>
<p n="ENG184001109">"My poor little creature! how did you do this?" said Mary, tenderly, taking the little hand in hers, and examining the frightful bruise.</p>
<p n="ENG184001110">"'Twas the billy-roller," said the little girl, in an accent that seemed to insinuate that the young lady was more than commonly dull of apprehension.</p>
<p n="ENG184001111">"But how did it happen, my child? Did some part of the machinery go over you?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001112">"No! — That was me," cried the elder, with a loud voice, and again holding up her demolished fingers. "'Twas the stretcher's billy-roller as smalshed Becky."</p>
<p n="ENG184001113">"'Twas, cause I was sleepy," said the little one, beginning to cry, for she construed Mary's puzzled look into an expression of displeasure.</p>
<p n="ENG184001114">"They beats 'em dreadful ma'am," said the sick woman, evidently exerting herself beyond her strength. "She's a good little girl for work; but they will fall asleep, all of 'em at times, when they be kept so dreadful long."</p>
<p n="ENG184001115">"But these bruises could not be the effect of beating," said Mary, again examining the arm, "it is quite impossible."</p>
<p n="ENG184001116">"Why, ma'am, the billy-roller as they beats 'em with, is a stick big enough to kill with; and many and many is the baby that has been crippled by it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001117">There was something so hollow, so sunken in the woman's voice, that Miss Brotherton felt terrified. The fact that a child of the size of the baby before her should have been beaten with such a weapon, and with such violence, seemed wholly incredible. Again she thought of Sir Matthew Dowling's warning, and wished that she were not alone.</p>
<p n="ENG184001118">"I am afraid that you are very ill," said she, "and I know not how I can help you. Money I can give, but there is nobody here to make use of it for you."</p>
<p n="ENG184001119">"Money!" murmured the sinking woman from her layer of straw. "Money, you can give money? Oh! give it, give it. Give it to her — give it to the child; she knows what it is, she knows I am dying for the want of it. It is too late for me, but give it, give it, and may God — "</p>
<p n="ENG184001120">Here the miserable creature's strength wholly failed; her eyes closed, and to all appearance, she was already a corpse.</p>
<p n="ENG184001121">"Oh! this is very dreadful!" cried poor Mary, wringing her hands, "nurse will know better than me," and so saying, she turned eagerly towards the door.</p>
<p n="ENG184001122">"She be gone, mother, and haven't gived nothing," said the eldest girl, in a voice so mournfully expressive of disappointment, that in spite of her alarm, Mary stopped to take half-a-crown from her purse, which she put into the child's hand.</p>
<p n="ENG184001123">She looked at the coin, and in a half-whisper ejaculated, "Oh!" Then creeping to the bed, she put it into the palm of her mother's hand, pressing the fingers down upon it, and in an accent of interrogation uttered the word "Bread?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001124">This Mary heard, but not the answer to it, for she had quitted the scene before it was uttered. On opening the door of the house, she started at seeing Sir Matthew Dowling still within a dozen yards of it; he was standing beside the carriage, with one arm extended to keep the door of it open, and the other resting against the vehicle on the opposite side of the opening, while his head thrust forward within an inch of good Mrs. Tremlett's nose effectually prevented her following her young lady, however much she might have wished to do so. He had, indeed, upon Miss Brotherton's disappearance reseated the good woman almost by force, and then addressed her in such a strain as was rapidly working her up to make an attempt to escape from the other side of the carriage, when the reappearance of the young lady released her from her thraldom.</p>
<p n="ENG184001125">"Mrs. Tremlett!" he said, "are you aware of the awful responsibility which will rest upon you if any thing unfortunate happens to your amiable, but most headstrong young lady? All the neighbourhood know, Mrs. Tremlett, that she has, as it were, placed herself for protection in your hands, refusing all other counsel, and shutting her ears to all other advice, and it is thus that you perform your duty!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001126">"Good God, sir! what do you mean?" said the good woman, in great agitation. "Let me out if you please, sir. If my young lady is in any danger, it is wicked to keep me sitting here. let me out, sir!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001127">"I will let you out, Mrs. Tremlett," replied the knight, still firmly retaining the position which so effectually kept her in, "I will let you out; but first, for her sake and your own, it is my duty to tell you in a few words the sort of place she has now thought proper to enter. Don't struggle, Mrs. Tremlett, but hear me. It is not possible they can do her any personal injury as long as I am so near the door of the house as at present. Be very sure that from some hole or corner of the filthy premises, some spying eyes are at this moment watching us. There is no danger of her being murdered now, but as sure as you sit there, Mrs. Tremlett, murdered she will be, if she goes without the protection of a powerful arm within such dens of sin and iniquity as she has entered now. One short moment more, Mrs. Tremlett — one short moment, while I tell what the creatures are among whom she has thrown herself. The house is notorious as one of the very worst in Ashleigh. The man is an habitual drunkard, whom I, and my excellent servant Parsons, have endeavoured in every possible way to reform — but in vain. The moment he has got his wages, he goes to the gin-shop, and often and often he won't work at all, which of course prevents his family from being in the comfortable easy circumstances which they ought to be. If he happens to be in the house now, I dare say there is no species of indecent language to which your young lady will not be obliged to listen. As to the mother of the family, I believe she is dying in consequence of a life passed in all sorts of the most abominable wickedness. Indeed I believe she is now half mad, for I have been told by some of my people whom I have sent upon charitable visits of inquiry to her, that she lies in her bed inventing the strangest lies imaginable. Indeed some think that notwithstanding she is so near death she still drinks, and that it is nothing but drunken lies that she makes people listen to."</p>
<p n="ENG184001128">"Pray, pray let me get out, Sir Matthew! Being murdered, sir, is not the only thing from which I should wish to save Miss Brotherton."</p>
<p n="ENG184001129">"One word more, Mrs. Tremlett, and I have done. The eldest girl is a notorious prostitute. Another, a year or two younger is going the same way. The boy is suspected of being an extremely skilful thief, and the two younger girls, for they all work at my factory, Mrs. Tremlett, and I know them well, the two younger ones are such depraved little wretches, that for the sake of example we have been obliged to turn them out of the mill, though we are in great want of young hands to do the work. Now, madam, I have done, and I leave it with you to judge how far it will be right and proper for Miss Brotherton to continue such frolics as these."</p>
<p n="ENG184001130">Sir Matthew was in the act of pronouncing the last words of this speech as Miss Brotherton opened the door of the house, and stepped out into the street.</p>
<p n="ENG184001131">On first perceiving her, the knight appeared about to take her hand, for the purpose of replacing her in the carriage; but his attention was called to the sound of many feet suddenly turning the corner of a street which led from a neighbouring factory. It proceeded from the workpeople, who were rushing home in scrambling haste to snatch their miserable dinners.</p>
<p n="ENG184001132">Gentlemen in Sir Matthew Dowling's situation, and enjoying the species of influence which belongs to it, take little or no pains to avoid meeting the people they themselves employ. They look not in the young eyes to read what sort of blessing cowers there, nor heed the crippled gait, or pallid visage of those who exist but by the poisonous employment which he gives them. But such gentlemen seldom, if they can avoid it, expose themselves to the remarks of any gangs belonging to their neighbours, and no sooner did Sir Matthew become aware that the mill in the next street was pouring forth its fifteen hundred hands, than he turned from the young lady who had passed by without appearing to see him, and taking his horse from the hand of the groom who held it, sprung with great activity into the saddle, and galloped off the way his indignant son had galloped before him.</p>
<p n="ENG184001133">Mary Brotherton meanwhile was utterly unconscious of the approaching throng; and intent only upon getting Mrs. Tremlett out of the carriage, turned her eyes neither to the right nor the left, but seizing her by the arm, exclaimed, "Come to me nurse, come to me!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001134">The good woman who was quite as desirous as herself of the reunion, required no second summons, but more quickly than it can be told, was first by the side of her young mistress in the street, and then entering with her the low door of the dwelling so fearfully described by Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG184001135">Had Mrs. Tremlett possessed the power, most assuredly she would have turned the steps of her charge the other way, and for ever have prevented her from exposing herself to the contemplation of such depravity as she had heard described; but knowing perfectly well that no such power was vested in her, the next wish she conceived, was to give all the assistance and support she could to the dear wilful girl to whom she had devoted herself.</p>
<p n="ENG184001136">Aware, as she entered the door, that many eyes followed them, nay, that many steps were stayed, apparently, to watch the spectacle so rare in Ashleigh of well-dressed ladies entering the sordid dwelling of operatives, Mrs. Tremlett herself closed the door as soon as they had both passed through it, and looking round upon the desolation of the chamber, trembled with an emotion made up of terror and compassion, at perceiving to what a scene the delicately-nurtured Mary Brotherton had introduced herself.</p>
<p n="ENG184001137">"This woman is very ill, nurse Tremlett," said the young lady, drawing her close to the bed. "For God's sake tell me what we had better do for her?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001138">"My dear, dear, Miss Mary come away, and send the doctor to her!" answered Mrs. Tremlett; positively shaking from head to foot, as she contemplated the ghastly countenance of the woman, the filthy rag that imperfectly covered her, and the scanty straw upon which her stiffening limbs were stretched. "This is no place for you, Miss Brotherton! come with me I say this moment, and we will send the doctor, and money, and clothes too, if you like it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001139">"If I like it! — Do you think I am amusing myself, Mrs. Tremlett? — Feel her hand — feel her pulse! I believe she is dying."</p>
<p n="ENG184001140">These words though spoken very quietly and deliberately, were uttered in a voice so unlike what she had ever heard from the young lady before, that the old woman became dreadfully alarmed.</p>
<p n="ENG184001141">"Oh, good God! she is losing her senses!" were the words she uttered as she threw her arms round the person of Miss Brotherton, and vainly attempted to remove her from the spot on which she stood.</p>
<p n="ENG184001142">"Fie upon you, Mrs. Tremlett!" said Mary, sternly, "do you fancy that you are doing me any good? Be satisfied that I am not losing my senses, and let me request that you will make an effort to recover yours. This woman's head is too low. My dear mother asked for pillows." Here the steady voice faltered, but it was now only for a moment. "I want the cushions from the carriage nurse Tremlett, will you get them, or shall I?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001143">Without answering a word the terrified old woman hastened to obey her, and did so in the best manner; for calling to the tall footman, who continued to stand beside the open door of the carriage, he obeyed the summons, which he supposed to be preparatory to his young mistress making her exit, by very unceremoniously thrusting right and left the curious group that still lingered on the threshold.</p>
<p n="ENG184001144">"Give me the cushions from the carriage, Jones," she said, "make haste, for God's sake!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001145">The man stared at her for an instant in utter astonishment, and then did as he was ordered.</p>
<p n="ENG184001146">"Now get upon the box and bid the coachman drive as fast as he can go, to the nearest doctor's — that's Mr. Thomas, I think, in Cannon-street. — Tell him Miss Brotherton has sent for him, and desire him to get into carriage directly."</p>
<p n="ENG184001147">Having uttered these commands as rapidly as she could speak, Mrs. Tremlett carried a couple of the carriage cushions to the bed, and with the assistance of Mary and the elder child, managed to raise the woman into a position apparently less distorted and painful than before.</p>
<p n="ENG184001148">"Have you any thing to give her?" said Mrs. Tremlett, addressing the child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001149">The little girl without answering, stepped to a sort of cupboard in the wall, and taking thence a pitcher without a spout, and a mug without a handle, contrived to tilt up the former so as to make it discharge a portion of its cotents into the latter.</p>
<p n="ENG184001150">"It is water," said Mary, watching the operation. "It will not hurt her, will it?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001151">"Nothing can hurt her, my dear love?" replied Mrs. Tremlett, her eyes filling with tears as she listened to the altered voice of her gay-hearted girl, whose smiles and frolics she had watched, and indulged, for so many years; but of whose deep feeling she had never conceived any idea till now. "I don't think anything can hurt her now, Mary. Her pulse flutters, and her forehead is quite damp. I have sent for Mr. Thomas, and he will probably be here immediately."</p>
<p n="ENG184001152">Mary's only answer was silently pressing the hand of her old friend as she took from it the broken mug of water, and then, kneeling on the sordid floor, she applied it to the pale dry lips of the sufferer.</p>
<p n="ENG184001153">The poor woman made an effort to meet it, and swallowed a mouthful eagerly; and then, relieved probably by the change of posture, and refreshed by the cool liquid, she stretched out the hand in which she still held Mary's half-crown, and said, "Go Betsy, buy — "</p>
<p n="ENG184001154">The child she addressed, eagerly seized the money in the hand that had fingers to close upon it, and flitted through the door in an instant.</p>
<p n="ENG184001155">The poor woman had again closed her eyes; but her breathing was more tranquil, and Mary hoped she had fallen asleep. With this persuasion she stood perfectly still and silent beside her, her own hand locked, though she was not conscious of it, in the grasp of her deeply affected nurse, while her whole soul seemed settled in her eyes as she fixed them immovably upon what she felt to be the most awful spectacle that a mortal can gaze upon, namely, the passing of a human spirit from life to death.</p>
<p n="ENG184001156">The little girl whose swollen and discoloured arm still remained uncovered, probably because she feared the pain likely to attend the replacing it in the sleeve, stood close beside her mother's head, childishly contemplating the cushions which supported it, and apparently as unconscious as they were, of the heavy loss that threatened her.</p>
<p n="ENG184001157">But this stillness did not long remain uninterrupted. All the members of the family, who had been named as belonging to the factory, except the father, returned for the purpose of taking such rest and refreshment as one hour (nearly half of which was consumed by the walk to and from the mill) could permit. The latch was lifted by the eldest girl, a delicate featured, but dreadfully dirty creature of about seventeen, with a sort of sharp eagerness, denoting the curiosity excited by the sight of the carriage stationed before their dwelling. On perceiving the deathlike countenance of her mother, made distinctly visible by the noonday light, that streamed through the open door, she suddenly stopped, clasping her hands together, and uttering in tones that sounded like a shriek — "Oh! God, she is dead!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001158">"No! not dead!" said Mary solemnly, and without turning her eyes from the object on which they were rivetted. "Not dead! — she is sleeping — Hush! — Do not disturb her!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001159">Close following on the heels of the first, came a second girl, about a year her junior, but with a countenance much less prepossessing. Dirty she was too, it possible more so than the others, and there was a look of stolid stupidity about her that, but for the sort of reckless audacity which lurked in her eye, might have given the idea of an almost brutal want of animation. A thin consumptive-looking lad of about fourteen, followed after her, and closed the door behind him as he entered.</p>
<p n="ENG184001160">"Oh! mother!" he exclaimed as her sunken face caught his eye, "I wish I was alongside of ye, and then we'd be buried together!" And without appearing conscious of the presence of the strangers, he suddenly threw himself upon the tottering bedstead, and nestling his face close to that of the dying woman, kissed her passionately again and again.</p>
<p n="ENG184001161">"My boy, you may hasten her going by that," said Mrs. Tremlett, gently. "Be still, be still all of ye!" But as she spoke, she, and Mary too, whose hand she continued to hold, made way for the eldest girl, who now eagerly, but silently pressing forward, dropped on her knees beside the bed, and throwing her two arms over the emaciated body, remained with streaming eyes that rested piteously on the face of her mother. The second girl looked on, till by degrees her heavy countenance appeared to stiffen into horror, and she too drew near, but with distended and tearless eyes, that seemed to speak more of fear than love.</p>
<p n="ENG184001162">Mrs. Tremlett looked anxiously into the face of her charge. It was deadly pale, and wore an expression of solemnity so new and strange, that the good woman threw her arms around her in an agony of fond anxiety, exclaiming, "My Mary, my dear, dear child! come away! Mary, Mary, come away! you can do no good. This scene is not a fit one for you to witness."</p>
<p n="ENG184001163">"You mistake, nurse. It is fit for me. It is necessary for me. Do not disturb me, nurse Tremlett! do not!" Then after a short pause, during which her eyes were closed, and her hands crossed upon her breast, she again whispered, "Could hse not pray with me? Shall I not ask her to pray with me?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001164">"My sweet girl, she will not hear you, I think," said the old woman, while the tears streamed down her cheeks. "But you shall be satisfied my darling," and approaching the bed, and leaning over the girl who knelt beside it, Mrs. Tremlett in a low but distinct voice pronounced the words, "Shall we pary with you?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001165">She was evidently heard and understood, for the hands that for some minutes had lain motionless, were with an effort brought together, and clasped in the attitude of prayer. Mary who was eagerly watching her every movement, suddenly stepped forward, and gliding in between the eldest and the youngest girl, dropped on her knees beside them. Mrs. Tremlett following close behind her, knelt also, and then with tremlbing lips, and faltering voice, but slowly, distinctly, and most reverentially, Mary Brotherton uttered the last and most impressive of those sentences in our litany which is followed by the solemn petition for deliverance. it was with a throb of pleasure at her heart, and an exclamation of thanksgiving from her tongue, that she heard the dying woman answer "Amen!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001166">Almost at the very instant she did so, the latch was again lifted, and Mr. Thomas, one of the three medical practitioners of Ashleigh, entered. Miss Brotherton was not conscious of ever having seen him before; but he, like every one else in the neighbourhood, perfectly well knew the heiress by sight; and now, even no, in the awful chamber of death, bowed low before her.</p>
<p n="ENG184001167">It would not be easy to describe the feeling with which she turned away from this ill-timed demonstration of respect. Yet it was with no harshness; for the struggle so often going on within us between our better and our worser natures, was at this moment so decidedly in favour of all that was good in her young heart, that there was hardly place for any severer feeling than pity within it.</p>
<p n="ENG184001168">She had risen from her knees as he made his bow, and turning gravely towards him, said, "If any thing can be done sir, for this poor woman, let it not be delayed. I fear she is very ill."</p>
<p n="ENG184001169">"Certainly, ma'am — certainly, Miss Brotherton, my best attention may be depended on. But will you first, my dear young lady, give me leave to observe that I would much rather see you in your carriage than here. I really cannot answer for it. It is in point of fact impossible to say whether there may not be something deleterious, something noxious, in short, to your very precious health in the atmosphere of this room."</p>
<p n="ENG184001170">"I thank you, sir. Be sure I will take quite sufficient care of myself; but it is not for me that your services are wanted — it is here!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001171">Sophy, the eldest girl seemed unconscious of what was going on, for she remained perfectly motionless on the spot where she had first knelt down; while the third sister, who had been sent on the poor mother's last errand for bread, and who had crept back unobserved into the room during the foregoing scene, occupied the space on her right hand, Mary Brotherton having knelt on her left, so that there was scarcely space for the approach of the smart apothecary</p>
<p n="ENG184001172">"Move, my dear girls!" said Mary, gently laying a hand on the shoulder of each.</p>
<p n="ENG184001173">They both rose; while Mr. Thomas, carefully storing the anecdote in aid of the gossiping part of his practice, looked and listened with astonishment to what seemed to him the very unnatural conduct of the rich young lady, and internally exclaimed, "A clear case of religious mania this, as I ever saw! She won't live long, probably. What a match!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001174">It required no very long examination of the poor patient, to discover that her last moment was rapidly approaching.</p>
<p n="ENG184001175">"Upon my word, Miss Brotherton, I really wish I could persuade you to come away," persisted the medical gentleman as he once more turned towards her. The air is becoming more mephitic every instant. "This woman is at the last extremity."</p>
<p n="ENG184001176">"Nothing, then, can be done for her?" said Mary.</p>
<p n="ENG184001177">"No, ma'am — nothing in the world. Not the whole college, if they were present, could keep soul and body together for another hour, I would venture to say."</p>
<p n="ENG184001178">On this Miss Brotherton put a fee into his hand, and bent her head in token that his business there was ended, and that he might depart. But he did not immediately obey the hint, for pocketing the unwonted golden prize, he seemed anxious to remain a little longer where such blessings abounded, and returning to the bed, again took hold of the poor woman's hand, and then said in a voice of authority — "Let me have some water."</p>
<p n="ENG184001179">It was Mary only who seemed to understand his words, and she immediately obeyed them, placing in his hand the broken mug which she had set aside upon the floor. The apothecary put the water to the lips of the poor woman, and she again swallowed a little of it, after which they saw her lips move as if she was making an effort to speak to them.</p>
<p n="ENG184001180">Mrs. Tremlett lent over her, and then, with a stronger effort she articulated — "Let me see William!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001181">"Who is William?" said Mrs. Tremlett raising herself, "Is it one of the children?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001182">"It be father," said Betsy.</p>
<p n="ENG184001183">"Where is he to be found?" cried Miss Brotherton, eagerly. "Let him be sought for instantly — where is he likely to be?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001184">"At the gin-shop," replied the ungracious Grace.</p>
<p n="ENG184001185">"If you know where he is, go for him," said Mary, impressively, "and for God's sake let him not delay!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001186">The girl she addressed stared at her as upon something utterly incomprehensible: but she obeyed, and, in so short a time as to show that the gin-shop was at no great distance, returned with a man of an exterior as filthy as the rest of his race, wretchedly crippled in the legs, and a complexion that spoke both of ill health, and intemperance.</p>
<p n="ENG184001187">"What! — It is come to that, is it, already?" said the man looking wistfully at her from the bottom of the bed, but with a countenance whose lines seemed too fixed in the expression of hard indifference, to permit its exhibiting much feeling.</p>
<p n="ENG184001188">"She asked for you, father," said Sophy gently, then taking one of her mother's hands in hers she murmured,"Mother! — Dear mother! — open your eyes upon us, father is here, and all of us" while large tear-drops fell upon the livid face as she hung over it.</p>
<p n="ENG184001189">The dying eyes were once more opened, and consciousness, and recognition of them all, were visible as she suffered them to rest first on one, and then on another. The boy only, from his position,she could not see; but even then, there seemed intelligence between them, and she certainly knew he was lying beside her, for her head rested against his, and she raised her left hand till her fingers touched his cheek. The youngest child also when the mother's eyes opened, was too much behind her, but she seemed aware of her vicinity,and pronounced the words "Little one!" probably her usual appellation,so distinctly as to make the child start, and instantly climb upon the bed to kiss her. The last movement was an effort to return this kiss; and the next moment Mrs. Tremlett removed the child's clinging lips from a corse.</p>
<p n="ENG184001190">A very awful interval of perfect stillness followed. "Can I be of any further service to you, Miss Brotherton?" from the lips of Mr. Thomas,were the first words that broke it.</p>
<p n="ENG184001191">Poor Mary only shook her head, but Mrs. Tremlett replied, "No, thank you sir, nothing more;" and with repeated bows, and rather a reluctant step, he departed; turning, however, to give another glance at the heiress, as he passed out, for he was not without hopes that she might fall down in a fainting-fit. Nothing, however, of the kind happened, and he disappeared.</p>
<p n="ENG184001192">"You will go now, Mary dear" whispered Mrs. Tremlett, "and I will come here to-morrow to inquire about them for you."</p>
<p n="ENG184001193">"Yes, I will go now," replied the young lady,"I cannot comfort them." Then looking round upon the steadfast group, as if to discover which of them appeared in the fittest state of be spoken to, she fixed upon the little Betsy, and placing a couple of sovereigns in her hand, told her to take care of them and give them to her father presently, adding, "tell your sister Sophy to come up to my house. This," giving a card, "is the place where I live."</p>
<p n="ENG184001194">She then led the way to her carriage, Mrs. Tremlett followed, and the next moment they were driving rapidly from the abode of the most abject misery, to a residence which every quarter of the globe had contributed to render luxurious.</p>
<p n="ENG184001195">It was evident that the heiress felt no inclination to converse; indeed, for by far the greater portion of the way her face was concealed by the bandkerchief which she held to her eyes, and Mrs. Tremlett had too much real feeling to disturb her. After driving, however, through the handsome lodge-gates, and sweeping up to the noble entrance of her mansion, where already, at the sound of her approaching carriage, two or three servants were seen waiting like a guard of honour to receive her, it seemed that her meditations had not been wholly confined to the deathbed scene she had witnessed, and that the sordid cabin, with its misery-stamped inhabitants, had made a deep impression; for the first, and for many hours the only words she uttered after her return, spoken to the ear of Mrs. Tremlett as they walked arm in arm together through the hall, were these:</p>
<p n="ENG184001196">"I too am living by the profit of the factory house. Is the division just? — Oh, God! Is it holy?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001197">The old woman felt that she trembled violently, but knew not what words to utter that might compose her.</p>
<p n="ENG184001198">On arriving at the foot of the stairs, Mary withdrew her arm, and mounting them more rapidly than her companion could follow, reached her bedchamber alone, which she entered, closing and bolting the door after her.</p>
<p n="ENG184001199">DISAGREEABLE MEDITATIONS — A CONFIDENTIAL INTERVIEW WITH A FAITHFUL SERVANT — ANOTHER INTERVIEW, NOT QUITE SO CONFIDENTIAL WITH A DAUGHTER — MARTHA AND MICHAEL TAKE A PLEASANT WALK TOGETHER TO VISIT THE WIDOW ARMSTRONG — A CONSULTATION.</p>
<p n="ENG184001200">It will be easily believed that Sir Matthew rode back to Dowling Lodge not in the very sweetest humour in the world. "Bring up a child in the way he should go," is an admirable proverb, and certain it is that when that "way" is agreeable, he does very rarely "depart from the same." Thus it happens that the young gentlemen and ladies, sons and daughters of the millocrats, who pile thousands upon thousands, and acres upon acres, by the secret mysteries of their wonderful compound of human and divine machinery, do rarely or never take their way into the dwellings that shelter and that hide the sufferings of their operatives. Nothing is so distasteful to a truly elegant mill-owner as any allusion, domestic or foreign, gossiping or professional, religious or political, to his factory, or his factory people; and the gay fatherly phrase, "Don't talk of that, for God's sake, my dear! — it smells of the shop," has turned away many innocent eyes from contemplating that, which had they looked upon it, could hardly have endured so long.</p>
<p n="ENG184001201">To know therefore that the wilful, whimsical, rich, and independent Mary Brotherton (while still too young to understand any thing whatever of the real nature of trade, and our glorious manufactures), — to know that she was beginning to thrust herself behind the scenes, and do Heaven knows what mischief among his devilish people, instead of minding her own business, and falling in love with his adorable son, was altogether too much to be borne with patience; and had it not been that the weather was so hot as to make him long for a draught of hock and iced water, a natural instinct would have made him turn aside from his park-gates, and pursue the by path which led to his factory, where, as he knew by experience, the sort of temper he was then in could find great relief, without any body but the overlookers being in the secret.</p>
<p n="ENG184001202">As it was, however, Sir Matthew Dowling reached his home; and the first thing he heard from the man who threw wide its portals was, that Mr. Parsons was waiting for him in his study.</p>
<p n="ENG184001203">"Bring me a biscuit, a bottle of Stein, and some iced water," said the knight in the accent of one not born to "enter the venerable presence of hunger, thirst, and cold," nor into that of heat or vexation either.</p>
<p n="ENG184001204">"What's the matter now, Parsons?" said he, throwing himself into a delicious arm-chair, and perceiving by one glance at the sour visage before him, that something or other had gone wrong. "The mill's not burnt down I suppose, is it?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001205">"And I'm not sure that would be the worst thing that could happen Sir Matthew, if it was," replied the confidential servant. "It is well insured you know, sir, and would bring in a famous sum, as sure as the bank, and that's more, I take it, than we can say of all our debts."</p>
<p n="ENG184001206">"Who the devil has been gossiping with you about the debts? What business is that of yours, I should like to know? Mind your billy-rollers Mr. Parsons, and take care your hands keep up with your machinery, that's your work; — and I can tell you, if you don't know it already, that the success of the concern depends more upon that, than upon any other thing whatever. The building is paid for, and the glorious machinery is paid for — mind that, sir, and where's the interest of it to come from if you let the hands go to sleep over it? I tell you what, Mr. Parsons, an overlooker is not worth his salt if he does not continually keep it in his head, that the more the machinery is improved the faster must the brats move to follow it. And you may rely upon it that where this is remembered early and late, day hours and night hours, the concern will answer, and every manager of it, master or man, will live well. But, by the Lord Harry! where it is not, they are as sure to go the wrong side of the post, as you are to go to bed to-night. It stands to reason, Parsons. If one man knows how to drive, and another doesn't, the one man's team will pay, and the other's won't; and I will be much obliged to any man who will tell me how I am to help being undersold in the market, if I don't contrive to make my machinery go as fast, and as long too, as the best of 'em. That's the business you are to attend to, Mr. Parsons, and I won't trouble you about any other."</p>
<p n="ENG184001207">"All true, Sir Matthew, every word of it. And I can't but say, though I scorn to be a boaster, — I can't but say, that I think I have given you reason to trust me. I am noted for being able to keep the children awake, and going longer than any other man in the mill. There isn't an overlooker in Ashleigh that can equal me with the strap or the billy-roller either, when I chooses to make 'em tell."</p>
<p n="ENG184001208">"I know all that, my good fellow, and I value your services accordingly. But I have been devilishly put out this morning, and that makes me snappish; besides, I am quite sure you have got something disagreeable to tell, by your face. So out with it, man, and make an end of it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001209">"Make an end of it, Sir Matthew?" replied Parsons, repeating the last words of the sentence with marked emphasis, "by the Lord, sir, that is exactly what I'm come to beg you to do. You must make an end of your charity job, Sir Matthew, for it don't answer in any way: we have lost one of the nimblest set of fingers we had, that wanted nothing but the strap to keep 'em going for sixteen hours out of the four-and-twenty, and I wish you could just hear what gratitude you have gained in return for it. There is not a single day comes round that the rickety little Armstrong don't blubber over his work like a church spout. And I overheard him, the young villain, when he didn't think I was so near — I overheard him when the scavenger-girl, as was cleaning under the mules, looked up and asked, why for he cried, when his brother had got such good fortune — I heard him answer. And what do you think he said, Sir Matthew?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001210">"How the devil should I know?" replied the chafed capitalist. "Don't stand mumming there, but out with it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001211">"Neither more nor less than this, Sir Matthew: 'Don't talk of his good fortune, Bet,' says he, 'he's the most unhappiest boy in all the world,' says he."</p>
<p n="ENG184001212">"Pestilent little vermin!" exclaimed Sir Matthew through his closed teeth. "Infernal fool that I was to listen to that idiot woman! — and Crockley too, who ought to know better, has been badgering me exactly with the same execrable nonsense. Never again as long as I live will I be persuaded to try any other scheme with the people than what we have always acted upon. Brutes and beasts they are, and like brutes and beasts they should be treated; — and so they shall by me, as long as my head's above ground."</p>
<p n="ENG184001213">"Well, sir, I can't but say I am glad you are come back to your right mind, as one may call it. Such romantical goings on can never answer in a factory, Sir Matthew. It an't the way to do business, and business is what we have got to do. And so, sir, I hope you will send that scamp Mike back to the mill to-morrow morning, for they can't say no worse of it, let us pay him off as we will, than that he's the most unhappiest boy in all the world. And that's what they says already."</p>
<p n="ENG184001214">"It won't do, Parsons. That boy must be got rid of. — What do you stare for, you ass? Do you think I am going to get hanged for him?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001215">"Oh! dear no, Sir Matthew — you know the value of your own life better than that, any how, — God forbid you should not. Only I did not overwell understand what you meant by getting rid of him."</p>
<p n="ENG184001216">"I must contrive to send him out of the way, at least out of this neighbourhood; and moreover with his own consent and his mother's too. That is what I meant, Mr. Parsons."</p>
<p n="ENG184001217">"You must know best, Sir Matthew. But it seems to me you are taking a deal of trouble about him. If you'll just let me have him back in the mill, I think I'll venture to say that he shall never get within reach of plaguing you any more — and I'd get a pennyworth out of him into the bargain."</p>
<p n="ENG184001218">"For a tolerably sharp fellow, Parsons, you're devilish dull about this business. Can't you guess that I should not be taking all the trouble you talk of, about such a beggar's brat as that, unless I had reasons for it. There's that lord's daughter that got me into the scrape, won't she be ferreting and ferreting till she finds out that the sweet little master has not found himself comfortable here? And ten times worse than her, — ay, a hundred fold, is that obstinate headstrong girl of old Brotherton's. My Lady Clarissa might be troublesome from mere folly, and might perhaps be stopped short in any mischief she was doing, by a few words from me. But not the old one himself could stop Mary Brotherton if she got a whim in her head. You should have seen her just now, Mr. Parsons, raving at me with her colour up and her eyes flashing, for all the world as if she had just escaped out of Bedlam, only because I cautioned her against going into Joe Drake's pigsty, — a pretty place wasn't it for a girl of her fortune to go visiting? But in she went, by heaven! and you may rely upon it, if such a girl as that, who cares for nothing, and nobody, once gets it into her head to go about among the factory people, she'll kick up more dust than we shall find it easy to lay again. I've been told already by one who I suspect wanted to put me on my guard, that this Mary Brotherton wished to have a little talk with Michael Armstrong. I can put two and two together as well as Miss Mary. She was at our cursed play last night, and I'll bet my life to a rotten egg that she wants to ask him what he cried for."</p>
<p n="ENG184001219">"Likely enough, sir," replied the overlooker with a grim smile. "I heard of the crying, I won't say that I didn't. You may guess, Sir Matthew that it was a good deal talked about among the servants — and then t'other of 'em blubbering away at the mill, must give a pretty notion, mustn't it, sir, of your goodness to 'em?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001220">"Say no more about it, it makes me mad!" exclaimed the knight. "One or both of 'em shall be sent to Deep Valley mill, Parsons, if I die for it!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001221">"There's none but 'prentices taken in at the mill in the deep hollow, Sir Matthew, if you mean that."</p>
<p n="ENG184001222">"Yes, sir, I do mean that," replied Sir Matthew with a very ominous frown, "and there Master Michael Armstrong shall go. 'prentice or no 'prentice, or I'll give him up my place, and take his."</p>
<p n="ENG184001223">"That's all, then Sir Matthew," said the overlooker, preparing to depart. "I com'd to put you up to the boys ingratitude, and have nothing further to say at present."</p>
<p n="ENG184001224">"You need not trouble yourself any more about that, Mr. Parsons. I will take care of him," replied the knight. Whereupon Mr. Parsons made a bow, and departed.</p>
<p n="ENG184001225">Sir Matthew Dowling had already taken one tumbler of hock-and-water. He now took a second, and then throwing himself back in his arm-chair, indulged for several minutes in very deep meditation. At the end of that time it seemed as if the good Rhine wine had done its office, for suddenly the knight's countenance became animated; the heavy gloom which had rested upon it disappeared, and springing to his feet he rang the bell with a sort of lively jerk which showed he had some project in hand that he greatly relished.</p>
<p n="ENG184001226">It was the lively Peggy who answered the summons; but though she entered almost out of breath from the eagerness with which she had traversed the passage which led from the kitchen to the study, and though she brought into immediate activity all the agaceries of which she was capable, a smiling nod was all she got in return, so eager did Sir Matthew appear to say, "Go to Miss Martha, Peggy, as fast as you can, and tell her to come here to me this very minute. Go, my dear, and make haste, there's a good girl."</p>
<p n="ENG184001227">Peggy was disappointed and angry, for she had a great deal to tell Sir Matthew about Michael Armstrong's ungratefulness, and all that the servants thought and said about it; but the command she had received was too peremptory to be trifled with, and though she very nearly slammed the study door in shutting it, she failed not to deliver her message, which was instantly obeyed with the most dutiful alacrity by Martha.</p>
<p n="ENG184001228">"Did you send Peggy for me, papa?" said she in entering.</p>
<p n="ENG184001229">"Yes, Martha dear, I did. How are you to-day, my dear girl? I have not seen you before this morning. Sit down, love, sit down; I want to talk to you, Martha, I have got something upon my mind that vexes me, and I am going to open my heart to you about it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001230">"Oh, my dear, dear papa!" returned Martha, "I should be so glad if I could be of any use to you!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001231">"You can, Martha — you can be of great use and comfort to me. In the first place you must be my father confessor, and let me confess my faults to you, and I hope you will give me absolution if you can; for I really am very uncomfortable."</p>
<p n="ENG184001232">"What can you mean, papa?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001233">"Why, my dear, I mean that I have been foolish enough to put myself in a great pet, when I ought not to have done any such thing. It is always wrong to let temper get the better of one; but in this case it was particularly so. You know the fuss that has been made about this little fellow that I have taken out of the factory — I do assure you, my dear girl, that I really intended to be a very kind friend to him. But I got so provoked at his crying upon the stage last night in that beautiful speech that was written for him, that I cuffed him soundly for it when he came off — and I am sadly afraid that I frightened the poor little fellow so violently that he will never feel comfortable, and at his ease with me again. You cannot think how this vexes me."</p>
<p n="ENG184001234">"Oh! my dear papa, he will never remember it any more if you will please to forgive him." And Martha's heart bounded with joy as she spoke, to think how completely Miss Brotherton's opinion would be changed could she but hear her father speak thus amiably of what had passed.</p>
<p n="ENG184001235">"No, Martha, no; I cannot bear to see his frightened look. And besides, my dear, I shall never be sure of myself — you know how hasty I am! — I should live in perpetual terror lest any thing should tempt me to give him a cuff. There are other reasons too, my dear Martha, which induce me to think that I should be doing the little fellow and his family infinitely more service if I apprenticed him to some good trade, than he could ever gain by running about Dowling Lodge."</p>
<p n="ENG184001236">The excellent good sense of this observation struck Martha as very valuable, and she uttered the most cordial approbation of the wisdom and goodness from whence it proceeded.</p>
<p n="ENG184001237">"I am exceedingly glad you agree with me, my dear child," proceeded Sir Matthew, "for I have an idea that you could be very useful in making the arrangement. Do you happen to know where the little boy's mother lives, my dear Martha?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001238">"No, papa — but Michael could show me."</p>
<p n="ENG184001239">"Then you should have no objection to pay her a visit on this business, my dear?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001240">"Oh! dear no! I should like it so much!"</p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG184001010">"You are as keen as your own lancet, Crockley; and I never turn a deaf ear to any thing you say. But it's monstrous hard though, that I can't walk about my own house without running the risk of seeing this odious little grub. By the way, Crockley, why could not my lady take a factory-girl in by way of charity? Some of the little wenches are sightly enough before they have worked down their flesh too far; and, though I can't say I am particularly tender over the lanky idiot looking slatterns that we mostly get at the mill, I'll bet what you please that I should never hate the sight of a girl, as I do the sight of this boy."</p>
<p n="ENG184001011">"Very likely not, Sir Matthew," replied the doctor, laughing immoderately. "But what would my lady say? And what would all the other ladies say? No, no, leave that alone, and make up your mind to let the boy have the run of the house for a month or two; after which you may send him to the devil if you will; for the good will be done, and the boy himself forgotten."</p>
<p n="ENG184001012">"That's all vastly easy for you to lay down, chapter and verse, wise man that you are," replied the knight. "But if I tell all, I can let you into a secret, Crockley, that would make you change your mind, perhaps. The long and the short of it is, that I can't keep my hands off him, and if the young black-hearted scamp — I know he is black-hearted, I'm quite sure of it on account of a look he has got with his eyes, that makes one always feel so uncomfortable — if he were to take it into his vile ungrateful head to go about the country telling every thing that I may have happened to say and do to him, when his nasty ways have pushed me further than I could bear, I don't think the history of the charity job would do much good, doctor."</p>
<p n="ENG184001013">Doctor Crockley gave a long low whistle; and then, after a minute's meditation, said, "That's a bore."</p>
<p n="ENG184001014">"I know it is," sharply responded his patron, "a devilish bore. But you don't suppose that I am to stand bursting with rage, and not take the liberty of speaking my mind to a factory grub, do you?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001015">"Heaven forbid! A whole factory full of wenches may all drop down dead, I hope, before it comes to that," replied his friend. "But what you have stated is worth attention, Sir Matthew. I don't like the notion of that child's having tales to tell. It spoils all."</p>
<p n="ENG184001016">"I know it," returned the vexed knight. "Martha told me just now, not ten minutes before you came, that Miss Brotherton said she should like very much to talk to the boy: she is as sharp as a needle, you know, and I'll answer for it would find out all he has got to tell, and a devilish deal more, perhaps, in no time. Pretty work that would make! would it not? Augustus is sure of her, he tells me; and just fancy such a match as that spoiled by the forked tongue of this little viper! The very notion makes one mad."</p>
<p n="ENG184001017">"A cure must be found for that mischief, let it cost what it may," replied Crockley; "and for the future it might be better, perhaps, for your charity, Sir Matthew, to show itself some other way. You are too honest-hearted, that's the fact. A fine bold intellect, like yours, can't descend to the paltry patience belonging to inferior minds. Is there no getting rid of the boy? No possibility of sending him 'prentice some where or other?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001018">"'Prentice?" said Sir Matthew, looking with a very singular expression into the face of his friend. "Prentice?" he repeated, and stretching out his hand, he seized upon that of Doctor Crockley, which he shook with extraordinary ardour. "Send him as a 'prentice! Upon my soul, Crockley, if you had laid down five hundred pounds upon the table, I should not have considered it as of one half as much worth as that one word 'PRENTICE. Yes, by Jove! he shall be a 'prentice. Oaf that I was for not thinking of it before! You don't know half the good you have done me by that word. 'Tis but lately, my dear fellow, that you and I have come to understand one another thoroughly; and I have never yet talked to you about one or two points particularly interesting to all our capitalists. I never mentioned to you, did I, the Deep Valley Mills, not far from Appledown Cross, in Derbyshire?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001019">"Never, Sir Matthew, as far as I can recollect," was the reply.</p>
<p n="ENG184001020">"Well, then, I will tell you something about them now, that will make you perceive plainly enough what a capital good hit you have made in talking of apprenticeship for my young darling. Deep Valley Mill, Crockley, is the property of my excellent friend Elgood Sharpton. He is one of the men born to be the making of this country. A fine, manly, dauntless character, who would scorn to give up his notions before any act of parliament that ever was made. His idea is, Crockley, — and I should like to see the man who would venture to tell me that it was not a glorious one, — his idea is, that if we could get rid of our cursed Corn-laws, the whole of the British dominions would soon be turned into one noble collection of workshops. I wish you could hear him talk; upon my soul, it's the finest thing I know. He says that if his system is carried out into full action, as I trust it will be one of these days, all the grass left in England will be the parks and paddocks of the capitalists. Sharpton will prove to you as clearly as that two and two make four, that the best thing for the country would be to scour it from end to end of those confounded idle drones, the landed gentry. They must go sooner or later, he says, if the corn-laws are done away with. Then down goes the price of bread, and down goes the operative's wages; and what will stop us then, doctor? Don't you see? Isn't it plain as the nose on your face that when the agricultural interest is fairly drummed out of the field, the day's our own? Who shall we have then spying after us to find out how many hours a day we choose to make our hands work? D'ye see, Crockley? If we choose to work the vitals out of them, who shall say we shan't?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001021">"I never heard a finer, clearer line of argument, in my life, Sir Matthew," replied the attentive listener. "That man, that Elgood Sharpton, seems born for a legislator. But I question not that when you two get together you act like flint and steel upon one another. Is not that the case?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001022">"Pretty much I believe," replied Sir Matthew; "and I promise you, Crockley, I give no bad proof of my confidence in your honour and friendship, by letting you into a few of our notions, for matters are by no means quite ripe for us to speak out, as yet. Our policy is, you must know, to give out that it is the operatives who are clamouring for the repeal of the corn-laws, whereas many among them, saucy rogues, are as deep as their betters, and know perfectly well, and be hanged to 'em, that our only reason for trying to make ' down with the corn-laws ,' the popular cry is, that we may whisper in their ears, 'down with the wages' afterwards. Ay, doctor, if we can but manage this England will become the paradise of manufacturers! — the great workshop of the world! When strangers climb our chalk cliffs to get a peep at us, they shall see, land at what point they will, the glowing fires that keep our engines going, illuminating the land from one extremity of the island to the other! Then think how we shall suck in — that is we the capitalists, my man — think how we shall suck in gold, gold, gold, from all sides. The idea is perfectly magnificent! The fat Flemings must give up all hopes of ever getting their finical flax to vie with our cotton again! — Crockley," but here Sir Matthew paused for a moment, as if half doubtful whether he should go on. The confidential impulse within him, however, worked so strongly in favour of the friendly smiling physician, that all reserve grave way, and winking his eye at him with a truly comic expression, he proceeded — "Crockley, they don't understand spinning in Flanders: they don't know yet how many baby sinews must be dragged, and drawn out to mix as it were with the thread, before the work can be made to answer. No, no, we have fairly given Master Fleming the go by in his own trade, so for the future he must just be pleased to go on hand-digging, and sewing every inch of his dung-muxen, till it teems with corns for exportation. That's what he's fit for; whereas science has put us rather in advance of all that, my good doctor. Our friends in Poland, too, shall plough away to the same tune, and Russia, from end to end, will become one huge granary at our service. Where will your aristocratic landholders be then, Crockley? Perhaps you can't tell? but I suspect I can. They'll just be in the factories, sir. Your manors and your preserves (we can get game enough from abroad), your manors and your preserves will be covered with factories, except just here and there, you know, where we capitalists may have taken a fancy to my Lord This-thing's grounds, or the Duke of T'other-thing's mansion, for our own residences. And this I maintain is just as it should be; and the reason why, is plain. We have got before all the world in machinery, and so all the world must be content to walk behind us. By Jove, if I had my way, Crockley, I'd turn France and the Rhine into a wine-cellar, Russia into a corn-bin, and America, glorious America, north, south, east, and west, into a cotton plantation. Then should we not flourish? Then should we not bring down the rascals to work at our own prices, and be thankful too? What's to step us? Trust me there is not a finer humbug going, than just making the country believe that the operatives are rampant for the repeal of the corn-laws."</p>
<p n="ENG184001023">"It is a treat to hear you, Sir Matthew. I should be at a loss to name any man that I thought your equal in the gift of eloquence. But, nevertheless, we must not forget business. We must not forget Master Michael Armstrong, Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG184001024">"No, no, my good friend, we will not forget him. Be patient for a moment, and I will make you understand how my friend Elgood Sharpton, and my darling protégé have been mixed up in my mind together. Sharpton's factory at Deep Valley is one of the most perfect institutions, I take it, that the ingenuity of man every produced. It is perfect, sir, — just perfect. In the first place it is build in a wild desolate spot, where the chances are about ten thousand to one against any of the travelling torments who take upon themselves to meddle and make about what does not concern them — it is a hundred thousand to one against their ever catching sight of it. You never saw such a place in your life, Crockley. 'Tis such a hole that I don't believe the sunshine was ever known to get to the bottom of it. It was made on purpose, you may depend upon it. Well, sir, Sharpton, who whatever he udnertakes is sure to get over the ground faster than any other man, for he never lets any thing stop him, Sharpton felt quite convinced, you see, that the only way to carry on the work to any good purpose was to UNDERSELL. And how was this to be done without loss instead of gain? That's a question I promise you that has puzzled many a man that was no fool — but, egad, it did not puzzle him. He knew well enough that it was not the material — that came cheap enough — nor yet the machinery, though Heaven knows that's dear enough; but 'tis the labour, sir, the damnation wages going on, on, on, for evermore that drains the money away. And what then does he do, but hit at once upon the very perfectest scheme that ever entered a man's head to lessen that ruinous burden. He knew well enough, for he has a most unaccountable deal of general information, that there were lots of parishes in England that didn't know what on earth to do with their pauper brats. There's many, you know, that say this one thing, this nasty filthy excess of pauper population is the very mischief that is eating up the country, and destroying our prosperity. But who's the greatest political economist, Crockley, the man who talks of the evil, or he who sets about finding a remedy? The political economists of the nineteenth century ought to erect a statue to Elgood Sharpton; and so they will, I have no doubt, when the subject come to be more perfectly understood. For just mark what he has done. First he finds out this capital spot for the job, and builds a factory there; next he either goes himself, or sends agents, good, capable, understanding men, to all the parishes that he finds are overburdened with poor. Then, sir, he enters philosophically into the subject with the parish authorities, but of course with proper discretion, and proves to them that in no way could they do their duty by the parish children, particularly the orphans, or those whose parents don't trouble them, so well as by apprenticing them to a GOOD TRADE."</p>
<p n="ENG184001025">Here Sir Matthew paused, and a merry glance was exchanged between him and his companion.</p>
<p n="ENG184001026">"Well, Crockley, it is a good trade, you know, a devilish good trade, isn't it? At any rate I promise you that so many parishes felt convinced of it, that Elgood sharpton had soon got Deep Valley factory as full of young hands as it could cram. Now it is since that, you must know, that old Sir Robert took in into his head that little children must not be overworked. He it was, I believe, that first set up that nonsensical cry to any purpose; and to be sure, nothing ever was so absurd in a country where every body knows that if the young pauper spawn could but be made to die off, every thing would go on well. Is it not strange now, that old Peel could not be contented to grow rich, and hold his tongue? but no, he got bit by some poisonous humanity notion or other, and a devilish shake he gave to the system just at first, by his absurd bill for the protection of infant paupers; but such men as Sharpton are not to be knocked down like ninepins, either by law-makers, or law; and to say the truth, old Sir Robert Peel's bill was to all intents and purposes a dead letter within two years after it was passed. Bless your soul, it was the easiest thing in the world to keep the creatures so ignorant about the bill, after first talk was over, the they might have been made to believe any thing and to submit to any thing. In fact the question for them always lies in an egg-shell. They must either do what the masters would have them, OR STARVE. That fact is worth all the bills that ever were passed: and another thing is, that as long as there's nothing to prevent our own friends and relations from being among the magistrates, even if complaints are made, we can manage them."</p>
<p n="ENG184001027">"How true it is, Sir Matthew, that there is no inequality of accidental condition that can equal the inequality produced by a decided superiority in the intellectual powers," said Dr. Crockley. "At this moment I give you my sacred honour that I look upon, you and your friend Mr. Elgood Sharpton also, as standing in a much more commanding position than any duke in the country. What's a long descent compared to a long head, Sir Matthew? I'll tell you what the difference is. A long descent pretty generally helps a man to empty his purse, whereas a long head will never fail to help him fill it. It is as clear to me, as that the sun's in heaven, Sir Matthew, that the game is in your own hands. I know — for I have made some curious experiments that way — I know what a dog may be taught to do by hunger, and you may rely upon it that it is just as powerful in a man. Egad, Sir Matthew, it is a very fine subject for scientific experiments. It is difficult to say how far it might go. If a dog, for example, may be taught tricks by hunger, that approach in ingenuity to the powers of man, why may not man, skilfully acted upon by the same principle, be brought to rival the docility of a dog?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001028">"I see nothing in nature to stop it, doctor," replied Sir Matthew, with an air of great animation. "But remember, my dear Crockley, this is not a point to be touched upon in the book we were talking of. The public, you know, can have nothing on earth to do with the private regulation of our affairs. People have just as much right to inquire at what o'clock my lord duke expects his valet to get up, and moreover what the valet eats for breakfast when he is up, as they have to know what hours our hired laborers keep, and what they feed upon. It is a gross inquisitorial interference, Crockley, and ought not to be though of in a free country."</p>
<p n="ENG184001029">"That's a first-rate idea though, Sir Matthew," said the doctor, taking out his pocket-book and pencil. "I must book that. It is turning the parliament into an office of the inquisition. The canters may call it a holy office , if they will, but the British people will never bear the notion of AN INQUISTION. That's a capital idea, I promise you. As to my parallel, you know, between a dog and a man, it is merely between ourselves, or such an out-and-out-friend as Mr. Sharpton, and it may be worth thinking about, perhaps, practically and scientifically, I mean; but certainly I should never dream of printing it. A hundred years hence human intelligent may have reached such a point of improvement that the plain good sense and practical utility of the idea may make it properly appreciated. but as yet we are not sufficiently advanced in the science emphatically denominated " the positive " in contradistinction to " the ideal ." It will come though, if we do but go on in the path we are in. But we are generalizing too much, Sir Matthew; nevertheless I suspect I have caught you idea. You have thoughts of sending your young favoiurite to Deep Valley mill, by way of putting the finishing stroke to your benevolent projects in his favour?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001030">"Exactly so, my dear friend. But we must have indentures, observe; and there is some little difficulty in that."</p>
<p n="ENG184001031">"I suppose you know best, Sir Matthew; else I should say that indentures cannot be necessary. From your description, the locality of this factory, with its romantic name, must be like the valley of Rasselas, at least in one particular — namely, that without wings the happy dwellers there would find it impossible to excape," replied the doctor.</p>
<p n="ENG184001032">"Difficult, exceedingly difficult, certainly; but not quite impossible; for without indentuires a runaway could not be legally pursued. And to tell you the truth, friend Crockley, I should not much approve giving a subject for a second part of Mr. Osmond Norval's dramma, in which the hero should appear upon the scene after a few months's residence in Deep Valley mills."</p>
<p n="ENG184001033">"That's true. But I don't see under what pretence you are to get the brat apprenticed to your friend Sharpton," remarked the cautious counsellor.</p>
<p n="ENG184001034">"If he is apprenticed to me, it will do just as well," replied the knight, "for I could make over the indentures to Sharpton easy enough, but it strikes me I might have some difficulty in making the mother consent to it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001035">"Not if you will be upon your P's and Q's, Sir Knight," said his friend: "you have nothing to do but go on sending tit-bits to the sick woman, and the rickety boy that you mentioned, and when they have got a little used to it she'll not choose to affront her generous benefactor . Remember the dog theory, Sir Matthew, they are all alike."</p>
<p n="ENG184001036">"I dare say you are right. but at any rate I had better keep out of that hateful brat's way, or rather take care that he keeps out of mine. But I shall bear the sight of him better if I make up my mind to send him to Deep Valley. Taht will wipe out old scores between us."</p>
<p n="ENG184001037">Having said this, Sir Matthew rose from the breakfast-table, seeming therby to indicate that the consultation was at an end. Dr. Crockley rose too; but, though he took up his hat and his riding-whip from the chair on which he had placed them, he lingered as if he had still something to say before he took his leave.</p>
<p n="ENG184001038">Sir Matthew, however, seemed to take no notice of the hint, but stretching out his hand said decisively, "Good morning, doctor, good morning. Let us see you again soon."</p>
<p n="ENG184001039">Dr. Crockley upon this stretched out his hand too, but instead of clutching that of the knight, he seized upon his button. "One word, Sir Matthew, one word. You are too much of a man of business to think me troublesome. Respecting that little appointment that you were talking about the other day; I should like to have it settled. Because, to say the truth, I shall consider myself as weaking your livery; or, to speak more fitly, to be fighting positively under your colors, when this is done; and of course you know we ought to understand one another completely."</p>
<p n="ENG184001040">"No doubt of it, Crockely. I said nothing that I do not mean to stand to. You shall have two hundred a year, paid quaterly, for attending to the health and wellbeing, and all that, you know, of the factory children. But as I don't want you to give them two hundred pounds' worth of physic, remember I shall expect that you will make up the deficiency in — in just saying round about the neighbourhood how remarkably well every thing goes on at Brookford Factory. I'll peldge you my word that every thing does go on capitally well there, Crockley, so you will have nothing on your conscience on that score."</p>
<p n="ENG184001041">"I am not afraid of that, Sir Matthew; I know I may trust you. But I should like a bit of a memorandum about my own business, if you please."</p>
<p n="ENG184001042">"Quite right, quite right, sir. I am too much a man of business to object to that. Draw up the engagement, such as you wish it to be, and I dare say I shall make no objection to signing it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001043">After this a cordial hand-shaking was exchanged and the friends parted.</p>
<p n="ENG184001044">AN UNFORTUNATE RENCONTRE — AN ADVENTURE — MISS BROTHERTON GROWS WISER EVERY DAY.</p>
<p n="ENG184001045">Mrs. Tremlett's inquiries proved successful. Jim Sykes, the weeding-boy, knew perfectly well where widow Armstrong lived; and after he had repeated his instructions three times, Mary Brotherton and her unresisting chaperon set off on their expedition. On one point only did the self-willed heiress yeild to the judgment of her companion. Mary, who knew, that though she seldom went beyond the shelter of her own park-paling, she often walked without fatigue within it for two or three hours together, wished to set off for Hoxley-lane on foot; but Mrs. Tremlett talked so much of the fatigue, that the good-natured girl consented to let the carriage convey them to the point at which the lane diverged from the high-road. This yielding, however, was wholly from consideration for her companion. For herself she believed the precaution quite needless; and she was right. However much her temper might have been endangered by the series of spoiling processes she had undergone, her health had been taken good care of, and few girls of her age in any rank, had greater power and will for exertion than herself.</p>
<p n="ENG184001046">Nevertheless, before she had driven half a mile, she heartily rejoiced at having sacrificed her own inclination to that of her good nurse; for the road to Ashleigh was the favourite ride of the officers quartered in the neighbourhood, and had she been seen on foot, it is probable that before reaching Hoxley-lane she would have been surrounded by a body-guard of military. So greatly did this danger appal her spirits, that the frist moment she found herself free from a white-gloved hand either at one window or the other, she stopped the carriage, and ordered the coachman to go far enough down the lane to permit her to ge out unoberserved by any persons passing by the road.</p>
<p n="ENG184001047">But poor Mary was this day doomed to disappointment; and the indignant, and almost passionate beating of her heart under it, made her more conscious, perhaps, than she had ever been before, how deeply the business upon which she was engaged had entered into her soul.</p>
<p n="ENG184001048">Soon after Sir Matthew Dowling had dismissed his breakfast companion, he strolled out towards his splendid stables, and perceiving his son loitering among the grooms, and himself equipped for the saddle, he inquired whither he was going to ride. "Only to Ashleigh, governor," was the reply. "Then wait five minutes, Augustus, and I will ride with you."</p>
<p n="ENG184001049">Whether the youth approved the proposal or not, he was fain to submit to it, and the evil star of Mary Brotherton contrived to bring them to the top of Hoxley-lane at the moment her carriage was about to turn into it.</p>
<p n="ENG184001050">"Stop!" cried the young lady, accompanying the word with a very energetic pull at the check-string. "Go on to Ashleigh," was the order the followed.</p>
<p n="ENG184001051">"Was ever any thing so provoking, nurse? Do you see who those hateful men are?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001052">"Why 'tis Sir Matthew, my dear," replied the gentle old woman.</p>
<p n="ENG184001053">"The wretch!" muttered Mary between her teeth at the very moment that sir Matthew on one side, and his languishing son on the other, besieged her carriage.</p>
<p n="ENG184001054">"Not for my right hand would I have him guess where I am going," thought she, as with a face suffused with the deepest carmine that agitation could produce, she forced her lips into an unmeaning smile in return to their salutation.</p>
<p n="ENG184001055">The father and son came to exactly the same conclusion, and at the same moment. There was but one cause that it was possible to assign for her evident emotion.She was deeply in love with Augustus, — more deeply then even the young man himself had imagined. The thing was plain, no doubt remained, no not a shadow of it on the mind of either father or son, but it was the elder gentleman only who at once determined to push so fine a game to its close, with as little delay as possible.</p>
<p n="ENG184001056">Feeling quite sure that there was no liberty he could take at this moment which would not be welcome, he made a sign t the coachman to stop, and deliberately dismounting he threw his reins to his groom, told Miss Brotherton's footman to open the carriage-door, and stepped in with the assumed air of a partially loved friend, who knows that no leave need be asked.</p>
<p n="ENG184001057">Mary shrunk back into her corner with considerably more disgust than if a reptile had possessed itself of the seat opposite.</p>
<p n="ENG184001058">"This is not quite as it should be, is it?" said Sir Matthew, with a leer. "Perhaps so me other may have a better right here than I?" And a very expressive smile accompanied the words.</p>
<p n="ENG184001059">"Sir?" said Miss Brotherton.</p>
<p n="ENG184001060">"Come, come, my dear child, you must not look vexed at any of my little jokes. You know how we all dote upon you! Dear creature! How beautiful that sweet blush make you look! He, he! there goes poor Augustus looking very much as if he could wring his papa's neck off. But his turn, we will hope, may come by and by. and now, my dear, I'll tell you what I am come here for. We all want you, and your good Mrs. Tremlett too, if she likes it, to come over to us quite en famille to-morrow. I don't know what love-powder you have been scattering amongst us, but there is not a single individual of the family who does not positively dote upon you. Tell me my pretty Mary, do you feel a little kindness for some of us in return?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001061">An attempt to take her hand accompanied this speech; and Mrs. Tremlett, who estimated pretty nearly her young lady's affection for Sir Matthew and his race, actually trembled for the consequences. But, to her great surprise, Mary answered, after the pause of a minute, "Oh, dear Sir Matthew! you are only laughing at me!" in a voice so exceedingly chilldish and silly, that it might, under similar circumstances, have made the fortune of a comic actress; and though she did not permit him to touch the hand he attempted to take, she placed it, together with its fellow, so playfully behind her, that Sir Matthew could only laugh and call her, "dear pretty creature!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001062">Meanwhile the carriage proceeded to penetrate through the dirty dismal streets, which, in that direction, formed the suburb of Ashleigh.</p>
<p n="ENG184001063">"I must get out here," said Miss Brotherton, suddenly pulling the check-string.</p>
<p n="ENG184001064">"Here? Impossible, my dear child!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001065">"Nothing is impossible t me, that I choose to do, sir," said the young lady, springing to the ground the moment the door was opened. The knight was fain to follow, the animated Augustus threw himself from his horse at the same instant, and Mrs. Tremlett held herself suspended on the step of the carriage to learn what she was required to do.</p>
<p n="ENG184001066">"I wish to know what is the matter with these miserable-looking children," said Mary, approaching a half-open door, at each side of which, crouching on the stone step, sat a pale and squalid-looking girl. The eldest might be ten years old, the youngest was certainly not more than six.</p>
<p n="ENG184001067">"Gracious Heaven! you are not going to speak to those creatures, Miss Brotherton?" exclaimed Sir Matthew, while his son instinctively backed his horse into the middle of the street.</p>
<p n="ENG184001068">"And why not, Sir Matthew?" said Mary.</p>
<p n="ENG184001069">"You are not aware of what you are doing; I give you my honour you are not. You have no conception that these sort of creatures are. My dear, dear Miss Brotherton, get into your carriage — get into your carriage, I conjure you!</p>
<p n="ENG184001070">Mary looked at him, but said not a word in reply.</p>
<p n="ENG184001071">"What ails you, little girl?" said she, putting her hand upon the shoulder of the youngest child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001072">"Billy-roller," answered the little creature.</p>
<p n="ENG184001073">"The billy-roller smashed her," said the eldest girl,"but 'twas falling asleep against the machinery as lamed me."</p>
<p n="ENG184001074">"Are you mad, Miss Brotherton!" exclaimed Sir Matthew. "Surely, Mrs. Tremlett, you ought to prevent your young lady from exposing herself to such scenes as these."</p>
<p n="ENG184001075">"Good morning, Sir Matthew, do not let me detain you," said the heiress, suddenly assuming the tone and style of a woman of fashion who chose to have her own way. "These sick little creatures quite interest me. Besides, I must positively find out who Billy Roller is."</p>
<p n="ENG184001076">"It is an instrument used in the works, Miss Brotherton. You know not to what you are exposing yourself — fraud, filth, infection, drunkenness! I give you my sacred honour that I think you are very likely to be robbed and murdered if you approach the thresholds of such dwellings as these."</p>
<p n="ENG184001077">"I beg your pardon, Sir Matthew," replied the heiress, "but you must excuse me if I obstinately persevere in judging for myself; I know I am a spoiled child, neither more nor less; and as such you must either give me up or bear with me. Permit me to wish you good morning; I shall do more than approach the threshold of this dwelling — I shall enter it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001078">Having said this, she waited no further parley, but taking a ragged child in each hand set her little foot against the door which already stood ajar, pushed it open, and walked in.</p>
<p n="ENG184001079">Her first idea on looking round her was that perhaps Sir Matthew was in the right. Filth she saw; infection might lurk under it; and who could tell if fraud and drunkenness might not enter the moment after, to complete the group?</p>
<p n="ENG184001080">But there was little of selfishness and much of courage in the heart of Mary Brotherton, so she presently forgot every notion of personal danger, and was thus enabled to see things as they really were.</p>
<p n="ENG184001081">On one side of the small bare chamber, and in some degree sheltered by the door which opened against it, stood a rickety machine once intended for a bedstead. Two of the legs had given place to brickbats, and instead of a bed the unsteady frame now supported only a thin layer of very dirty straw, with the body of a dying female stretched upon it. The only other article of furniture in the room was an old deal box without a cover, but having a couple of planks, each about three feet long, laid across it; serving either for table or chairs as occasion might require. The walls, the floor, the ceiling, and the remnant of a window, were all alike begrimed with smoke and dirt.</p>
<p n="ENG184001082">It took not long to make this inventory, and having completed it, the young lady, still holding in each hand a staring child, turned towards the inhabitant of this miserable den, and said,</p>
<p n="ENG184001083">"Are you ill, my good woman?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001084">The being she addressed raised her heavy eyes, and in a voice so low as to be scarcely intelligible, answered "Yes."</p>
<p n="ENG184001085">"Have you no assistance, nobody to nurse you?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001086">"Nobody but these," pointing to the children.</p>
<p n="ENG184001087">"Has any doctor seen her?" demanded Mary of the eldest child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001088">"No ma'am," replied the little girl.</p>
<p n="ENG184001089">"And how long has she been ill?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001090">"Ever since she com'd from the mill."</p>
<p n="ENG184001091">"And how long is that?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001092">"A twelvemonth," said the little one.</p>
<p n="ENG184001093">"I don't know," said the elder.</p>
<p n="ENG184001094">"But, my poor children, you are not the only people that live with her, I suppose? Have you got any father?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001095">"Yes."</p>
<p n="ENG184001096">"Where is he?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001097">"At the mill."</p>
<p n="ENG184001098">"Have you got any body else belonging to you?" said Miss Brotherton, shuddering.</p>
<p n="ENG184001099">"There's Sophy, and Dick, and Grace," replied the eldest child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001100">"Where are they all?" again inquired Miss Brotherton.</p>
<p n="ENG184001101">"At the mill," was again the answer.</p>
<p n="ENG184001102">"Are Sophy and Grace grown up?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001103">"Sophy is," answered the child, "and Grace, almost."</p>
<p n="ENG184001104">"Then why do they not stay at home, one of them at least, to take care of this poor woman?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001105">"'Cause they mustn't. I 'tends mother."</p>
<p n="ENG184001106">"You are not big enough to take care of her, my poor child. Why don't you go to the factory, and let one of the bigger ones stay at home?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001107">"They won't have me now, 'cause of this." — and as she spake, the child held up a little shrivelled right-hand, three fingers of which had a joint deficient. "I can't piece now, and so they won't let me come."</p>
<p n="ENG184001108">"And Sophy won't let me go, 'cause of this," said the little one, slipping her arm out of a bedgown (which was the only garment she had), and displaying the limb swollen and discoloured, from some violent contusion.</p>
<p n="ENG184001109">"My poor little creature! how did you do this?" said Mary, tenderly, taking the little hand in hers, and examining the frightful bruise.</p>
<p n="ENG184001110">"'Twas the billy-roller," said the little girl, in an accent that seemed to insinuate that the young lady was more than commonly dull of apprehension.</p>
<p n="ENG184001111">"But how did it happen, my child? Did some part of the machinery go over you?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001112">"No! — That was me," cried the elder, with a loud voice, and again holding up her demolished fingers. "'Twas the stretcher's billy-roller as smalshed Becky."</p>
<p n="ENG184001113">"'Twas, cause I was sleepy," said the little one, beginning to cry, for she construed Mary's puzzled look into an expression of displeasure.</p>
<p n="ENG184001114">"They beats 'em dreadful ma'am," said the sick woman, evidently exerting herself beyond her strength. "She's a good little girl for work; but they will fall asleep, all of 'em at times, when they be kept so dreadful long."</p>
<p n="ENG184001115">"But these bruises could not be the effect of beating," said Mary, again examining the arm, "it is quite impossible."</p>
<p n="ENG184001116">"Why, ma'am, the billy-roller as they beats 'em with, is a stick big enough to kill with; and many and many is the baby that has been crippled by it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001117">There was something so hollow, so sunken in the woman's voice, that Miss Brotherton felt terrified. The fact that a child of the size of the baby before her should have been beaten with such a weapon, and with such violence, seemed wholly incredible. Again she thought of Sir Matthew Dowling's warning, and wished that she were not alone.</p>
<p n="ENG184001118">"I am afraid that you are very ill," said she, "and I know not how I can help you. Money I can give, but there is nobody here to make use of it for you."</p>
<p n="ENG184001119">"Money!" murmured the sinking woman from her layer of straw. "Money, you can give money? Oh! give it, give it. Give it to her — give it to the child; she knows what it is, she knows I am dying for the want of it. It is too late for me, but give it, give it, and may God — "</p>
<p n="ENG184001120">Here the miserable creature's strength wholly failed; her eyes closed, and to all appearance, she was already a corpse.</p>
<p n="ENG184001121">"Oh! this is very dreadful!" cried poor Mary, wringing her hands, "nurse will know better than me," and so saying, she turned eagerly towards the door.</p>
<p n="ENG184001122">"She be gone, mother, and haven't gived nothing," said the eldest girl, in a voice so mournfully expressive of disappointment, that in spite of her alarm, Mary stopped to take half-a-crown from her purse, which she put into the child's hand.</p>
<p n="ENG184001123">She looked at the coin, and in a half-whisper ejaculated, "Oh!" Then creeping to the bed, she put it into the palm of her mother's hand, pressing the fingers down upon it, and in an accent of interrogation uttered the word "Bread?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001124">This Mary heard, but not the answer to it, for she had quitted the scene before it was uttered. On opening the door of the house, she started at seeing Sir Matthew Dowling still within a dozen yards of it; he was standing beside the carriage, with one arm extended to keep the door of it open, and the other resting against the vehicle on the opposite side of the opening, while his head thrust forward within an inch of good Mrs. Tremlett's nose effectually prevented her following her young lady, however much she might have wished to do so. He had, indeed, upon Miss Brotherton's disappearance reseated the good woman almost by force, and then addressed her in such a strain as was rapidly working her up to make an attempt to escape from the other side of the carriage, when the reappearance of the young lady released her from her thraldom.</p>
<p n="ENG184001125">"Mrs. Tremlett!" he said, "are you aware of the awful responsibility which will rest upon you if any thing unfortunate happens to your amiable, but most headstrong young lady? All the neighbourhood know, Mrs. Tremlett, that she has, as it were, placed herself for protection in your hands, refusing all other counsel, and shutting her ears to all other advice, and it is thus that you perform your duty!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001126">"Good God, sir! what do you mean?" said the good woman, in great agitation. "Let me out if you please, sir. If my young lady is in any danger, it is wicked to keep me sitting here. let me out, sir!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001127">"I will let you out, Mrs. Tremlett," replied the knight, still firmly retaining the position which so effectually kept her in, "I will let you out; but first, for her sake and your own, it is my duty to tell you in a few words the sort of place she has now thought proper to enter. Don't struggle, Mrs. Tremlett, but hear me. It is not possible they can do her any personal injury as long as I am so near the door of the house as at present. Be very sure that from some hole or corner of the filthy premises, some spying eyes are at this moment watching us. There is no danger of her being murdered now, but as sure as you sit there, Mrs. Tremlett, murdered she will be, if she goes without the protection of a powerful arm within such dens of sin and iniquity as she has entered now. One short moment more, Mrs. Tremlett — one short moment, while I tell what the creatures are among whom she has thrown herself. The house is notorious as one of the very worst in Ashleigh. The man is an habitual drunkard, whom I, and my excellent servant Parsons, have endeavoured in every possible way to reform — but in vain. The moment he has got his wages, he goes to the gin-shop, and often and often he won't work at all, which of course prevents his family from being in the comfortable easy circumstances which they ought to be. If he happens to be in the house now, I dare say there is no species of indecent language to which your young lady will not be obliged to listen. As to the mother of the family, I believe she is dying in consequence of a life passed in all sorts of the most abominable wickedness. Indeed I believe she is now half mad, for I have been told by some of my people whom I have sent upon charitable visits of inquiry to her, that she lies in her bed inventing the strangest lies imaginable. Indeed some think that notwithstanding she is so near death she still drinks, and that it is nothing but drunken lies that she makes people listen to."</p>
<p n="ENG184001128">"Pray, pray let me get out, Sir Matthew! Being murdered, sir, is not the only thing from which I should wish to save Miss Brotherton."</p>
<p n="ENG184001129">"One word more, Mrs. Tremlett, and I have done. The eldest girl is a notorious prostitute. Another, a year or two younger is going the same way. The boy is suspected of being an extremely skilful thief, and the two younger girls, for they all work at my factory, Mrs. Tremlett, and I know them well, the two younger ones are such depraved little wretches, that for the sake of example we have been obliged to turn them out of the mill, though we are in great want of young hands to do the work. Now, madam, I have done, and I leave it with you to judge how far it will be right and proper for Miss Brotherton to continue such frolics as these."</p>
<p n="ENG184001130">Sir Matthew was in the act of pronouncing the last words of this speech as Miss Brotherton opened the door of the house, and stepped out into the street.</p>
<p n="ENG184001131">On first perceiving her, the knight appeared about to take her hand, for the purpose of replacing her in the carriage; but his attention was called to the sound of many feet suddenly turning the corner of a street which led from a neighbouring factory. It proceeded from the workpeople, who were rushing home in scrambling haste to snatch their miserable dinners.</p>
<p n="ENG184001132">Gentlemen in Sir Matthew Dowling's situation, and enjoying the species of influence which belongs to it, take little or no pains to avoid meeting the people they themselves employ. They look not in the young eyes to read what sort of blessing cowers there, nor heed the crippled gait, or pallid visage of those who exist but by the poisonous employment which he gives them. But such gentlemen seldom, if they can avoid it, expose themselves to the remarks of any gangs belonging to their neighbours, and no sooner did Sir Matthew become aware that the mill in the next street was pouring forth its fifteen hundred hands, than he turned from the young lady who had passed by without appearing to see him, and taking his horse from the hand of the groom who held it, sprung with great activity into the saddle, and galloped off the way his indignant son had galloped before him.</p>
<p n="ENG184001133">Mary Brotherton meanwhile was utterly unconscious of the approaching throng; and intent only upon getting Mrs. Tremlett out of the carriage, turned her eyes neither to the right nor the left, but seizing her by the arm, exclaimed, "Come to me nurse, come to me!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001134">The good woman who was quite as desirous as herself of the reunion, required no second summons, but more quickly than it can be told, was first by the side of her young mistress in the street, and then entering with her the low door of the dwelling so fearfully described by Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG184001135">Had Mrs. Tremlett possessed the power, most assuredly she would have turned the steps of her charge the other way, and for ever have prevented her from exposing herself to the contemplation of such depravity as she had heard described; but knowing perfectly well that no such power was vested in her, the next wish she conceived, was to give all the assistance and support she could to the dear wilful girl to whom she had devoted herself.</p>
<p n="ENG184001136">Aware, as she entered the door, that many eyes followed them, nay, that many steps were stayed, apparently, to watch the spectacle so rare in Ashleigh of well-dressed ladies entering the sordid dwelling of operatives, Mrs. Tremlett herself closed the door as soon as they had both passed through it, and looking round upon the desolation of the chamber, trembled with an emotion made up of terror and compassion, at perceiving to what a scene the delicately-nurtured Mary Brotherton had introduced herself.</p>
<p n="ENG184001137">"This woman is very ill, nurse Tremlett," said the young lady, drawing her close to the bed. "For God's sake tell me what we had better do for her?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001138">"My dear, dear, Miss Mary come away, and send the doctor to her!" answered Mrs. Tremlett; positively shaking from head to foot, as she contemplated the ghastly countenance of the woman, the filthy rag that imperfectly covered her, and the scanty straw upon which her stiffening limbs were stretched. "This is no place for you, Miss Brotherton! come with me I say this moment, and we will send the doctor, and money, and clothes too, if you like it."</p>
<p n="ENG184001139">"If I like it! — Do you think I am amusing myself, Mrs. Tremlett? — Feel her hand — feel her pulse! I believe she is dying."</p>
<p n="ENG184001140">These words though spoken very quietly and deliberately, were uttered in a voice so unlike what she had ever heard from the young lady before, that the old woman became dreadfully alarmed.</p>
<p n="ENG184001141">"Oh, good God! she is losing her senses!" were the words she uttered as she threw her arms round the person of Miss Brotherton, and vainly attempted to remove her from the spot on which she stood.</p>
<p n="ENG184001142">"Fie upon you, Mrs. Tremlett!" said Mary, sternly, "do you fancy that you are doing me any good? Be satisfied that I am not losing my senses, and let me request that you will make an effort to recover yours. This woman's head is too low. My dear mother asked for pillows." Here the steady voice faltered, but it was now only for a moment. "I want the cushions from the carriage nurse Tremlett, will you get them, or shall I?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001143">Without answering a word the terrified old woman hastened to obey her, and did so in the best manner; for calling to the tall footman, who continued to stand beside the open door of the carriage, he obeyed the summons, which he supposed to be preparatory to his young mistress making her exit, by very unceremoniously thrusting right and left the curious group that still lingered on the threshold.</p>
<p n="ENG184001144">"Give me the cushions from the carriage, Jones," she said, "make haste, for God's sake!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001145">The man stared at her for an instant in utter astonishment, and then did as he was ordered.</p>
<p n="ENG184001146">"Now get upon the box and bid the coachman drive as fast as he can go, to the nearest doctor's — that's Mr. Thomas, I think, in Cannon-street. — Tell him Miss Brotherton has sent for him, and desire him to get into carriage directly."</p>
<p n="ENG184001147">Having uttered these commands as rapidly as she could speak, Mrs. Tremlett carried a couple of the carriage cushions to the bed, and with the assistance of Mary and the elder child, managed to raise the woman into a position apparently less distorted and painful than before.</p>
<p n="ENG184001148">"Have you any thing to give her?" said Mrs. Tremlett, addressing the child.</p>
<p n="ENG184001149">The little girl without answering, stepped to a sort of cupboard in the wall, and taking thence a pitcher without a spout, and a mug without a handle, contrived to tilt up the former so as to make it discharge a portion of its cotents into the latter.</p>
<p n="ENG184001150">"It is water," said Mary, watching the operation. "It will not hurt her, will it?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001151">"Nothing can hurt her, my dear love?" replied Mrs. Tremlett, her eyes filling with tears as she listened to the altered voice of her gay-hearted girl, whose smiles and frolics she had watched, and indulged, for so many years; but of whose deep feeling she had never conceived any idea till now. "I don't think anything can hurt her now, Mary. Her pulse flutters, and her forehead is quite damp. I have sent for Mr. Thomas, and he will probably be here immediately."</p>
<p n="ENG184001152">Mary's only answer was silently pressing the hand of her old friend as she took from it the broken mug of water, and then, kneeling on the sordid floor, she applied it to the pale dry lips of the sufferer.</p>
<p n="ENG184001153">The poor woman made an effort to meet it, and swallowed a mouthful eagerly; and then, relieved probably by the change of posture, and refreshed by the cool liquid, she stretched out the hand in which she still held Mary's half-crown, and said, "Go Betsy, buy — "</p>
<p n="ENG184001154">The child she addressed, eagerly seized the money in the hand that had fingers to close upon it, and flitted through the door in an instant.</p>
<p n="ENG184001155">The poor woman had again closed her eyes; but her breathing was more tranquil, and Mary hoped she had fallen asleep. With this persuasion she stood perfectly still and silent beside her, her own hand locked, though she was not conscious of it, in the grasp of her deeply affected nurse, while her whole soul seemed settled in her eyes as she fixed them immovably upon what she felt to be the most awful spectacle that a mortal can gaze upon, namely, the passing of a human spirit from life to death.</p>
<p n="ENG184001156">The little girl whose swollen and discoloured arm still remained uncovered, probably because she feared the pain likely to attend the replacing it in the sleeve, stood close beside her mother's head, childishly contemplating the cushions which supported it, and apparently as unconscious as they were, of the heavy loss that threatened her.</p>
<p n="ENG184001157">But this stillness did not long remain uninterrupted. All the members of the family, who had been named as belonging to the factory, except the father, returned for the purpose of taking such rest and refreshment as one hour (nearly half of which was consumed by the walk to and from the mill) could permit. The latch was lifted by the eldest girl, a delicate featured, but dreadfully dirty creature of about seventeen, with a sort of sharp eagerness, denoting the curiosity excited by the sight of the carriage stationed before their dwelling. On perceiving the deathlike countenance of her mother, made distinctly visible by the noonday light, that streamed through the open door, she suddenly stopped, clasping her hands together, and uttering in tones that sounded like a shriek — "Oh! God, she is dead!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001158">"No! not dead!" said Mary solemnly, and without turning her eyes from the object on which they were rivetted. "Not dead! — she is sleeping — Hush! — Do not disturb her!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001159">Close following on the heels of the first, came a second girl, about a year her junior, but with a countenance much less prepossessing. Dirty she was too, it possible more so than the others, and there was a look of stolid stupidity about her that, but for the sort of reckless audacity which lurked in her eye, might have given the idea of an almost brutal want of animation. A thin consumptive-looking lad of about fourteen, followed after her, and closed the door behind him as he entered.</p>
<p n="ENG184001160">"Oh! mother!" he exclaimed as her sunken face caught his eye, "I wish I was alongside of ye, and then we'd be buried together!" And without appearing conscious of the presence of the strangers, he suddenly threw himself upon the tottering bedstead, and nestling his face close to that of the dying woman, kissed her passionately again and again.</p>
<p n="ENG184001161">"My boy, you may hasten her going by that," said Mrs. Tremlett, gently. "Be still, be still all of ye!" But as she spoke, she, and Mary too, whose hand she continued to hold, made way for the eldest girl, who now eagerly, but silently pressing forward, dropped on her knees beside the bed, and throwing her two arms over the emaciated body, remained with streaming eyes that rested piteously on the face of her mother. The second girl looked on, till by degrees her heavy countenance appeared to stiffen into horror, and she too drew near, but with distended and tearless eyes, that seemed to speak more of fear than love.</p>
<p n="ENG184001162">Mrs. Tremlett looked anxiously into the face of her charge. It was deadly pale, and wore an expression of solemnity so new and strange, that the good woman threw her arms around her in an agony of fond anxiety, exclaiming, "My Mary, my dear, dear child! come away! Mary, Mary, come away! you can do no good. This scene is not a fit one for you to witness."</p>
<p n="ENG184001163">"You mistake, nurse. It is fit for me. It is necessary for me. Do not disturb me, nurse Tremlett! do not!" Then after a short pause, during which her eyes were closed, and her hands crossed upon her breast, she again whispered, "Could hse not pray with me? Shall I not ask her to pray with me?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001164">"My sweet girl, she will not hear you, I think," said the old woman, while the tears streamed down her cheeks. "But you shall be satisfied my darling," and approaching the bed, and leaning over the girl who knelt beside it, Mrs. Tremlett in a low but distinct voice pronounced the words, "Shall we pary with you?"</p>
<p n="ENG184001165">She was evidently heard and understood, for the hands that for some minutes had lain motionless, were with an effort brought together, and clasped in the attitude of prayer. Mary who was eagerly watching her every movement, suddenly stepped forward, and gliding in between the eldest and the youngest girl, dropped on her knees beside them. Mrs. Tremlett following close behind her, knelt also, and then with tremlbing lips, and faltering voice, but slowly, distinctly, and most reverentially, Mary Brotherton uttered the last and most impressive of those sentences in our litany which is followed by the solemn petition for deliverance. it was with a throb of pleasure at her heart, and an exclamation of thanksgiving from her tongue, that she heard the dying woman answer "Amen!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001166">Almost at the very instant she did so, the latch was again lifted, and Mr. Thomas, one of the three medical practitioners of Ashleigh, entered. Miss Brotherton was not conscious of ever having seen him before; but he, like every one else in the neighbourhood, perfectly well knew the heiress by sight; and now, even no, in the awful chamber of death, bowed low before her.</p>
<p n="ENG184001167">It would not be easy to describe the feeling with which she turned away from this ill-timed demonstration of respect. Yet it was with no harshness; for the struggle so often going on within us between our better and our worser natures, was at this moment so decidedly in favour of all that was good in her young heart, that there was hardly place for any severer feeling than pity within it.</p>
<p n="ENG184001168">She had risen from her knees as he made his bow, and turning gravely towards him, said, "If any thing can be done sir, for this poor woman, let it not be delayed. I fear she is very ill."</p>
<p n="ENG184001169">"Certainly, ma'am — certainly, Miss Brotherton, my best attention may be depended on. But will you first, my dear young lady, give me leave to observe that I would much rather see you in your carriage than here. I really cannot answer for it. It is in point of fact impossible to say whether there may not be something deleterious, something noxious, in short, to your very precious health in the atmosphere of this room."</p>
<p n="ENG184001170">"I thank you, sir. Be sure I will take quite sufficient care of myself; but it is not for me that your services are wanted — it is here!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001171">Sophy, the eldest girl seemed unconscious of what was going on, for she remained perfectly motionless on the spot where she had first knelt down; while the third sister, who had been sent on the poor mother's last errand for bread, and who had crept back unobserved into the room during the foregoing scene, occupied the space on her right hand, Mary Brotherton having knelt on her left, so that there was scarcely space for the approach of the smart apothecary</p>
<p n="ENG184001172">"Move, my dear girls!" said Mary, gently laying a hand on the shoulder of each.</p>
<p n="ENG184001173">They both rose; while Mr. Thomas, carefully storing the anecdote in aid of the gossiping part of his practice, looked and listened with astonishment to what seemed to him the very unnatural conduct of the rich young lady, and internally exclaimed, "A clear case of religious mania this, as I ever saw! She won't live long, probably. What a match!"</p>
<p n="ENG184001174">It required no very long examination of the poor patient, to discover that her last moment was rapidly approaching.</p>
<p n="ENG184001175">"Upon my word, Miss Brotherton, I really wish I could persuade you to come away," persisted the medical gentleman as he once more turned towards her. The air is becoming more mephitic every instant. "This woman is at the last extremity."</p>

<sample><p n="ENG18400234">"I'll be burnt if I don't think it very likely that it was his own father sent him here, and no one else," said Mr. Jennings, chuckling.</p>
<p n="ENG18400235">"Fie! Jennings, fie!" returned Mrs. Thompson, with a frown. "God in heaven only knows what may have been the cause of it! — Not but what it does look strange, there's no denying that."</p>
<p n="ENG18400236">"Do you know any thing about your father, child?" said Mr. Simkins in a magisterial tone.</p>
<p n="ENG18400237">"Father's in heaven," replied the child.</p>
<p n="ENG18400238">"Mercy on me! do you hear him? Is not that like mocking the Lord's prayer?" exclaimed the lady's-maid.</p>
<p n="ENG18400239">"No, it is not!" said Michael, while a flash of youthful indignation rushed into his face. "My father is in heaven along with God."</p>
<p n="ENG18400240">"I dare say he means that his father is dead," observed the butler with an air of great sagacity; "and if what has been jealoused at is correct," he added, winking his eye at Mr. Jennings, "it is very natural that he should have been told to say so."</p>
<p n="ENG18400241">"That's very true," said the housekeeper, "and it may be, certainly, that the child knows nothing about it whatever, either one way or t'other — indeed I think it's a good deal the most likely that he does not; — but, any how, it's a very shocking business, and, as far as I am concerned, I'll neither make nor meddle in the matter. — Of course, the men-servants may do just as they like about taking notice of him — for here he is, and here he will bide, I dare say; but I recommend the maids to follow my example, and not to injure their characters, nor to corrupt their morals by having any thing to do with the offspring of — It is more decent not to finish what I was going to say for your goods, young women, — and lucky it is that there is no need. You must all understand me without it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400242">Mrs. Thompson then rose from her chair, and turning her eyes, and indeed her head, aside, to prevent herself from again seeing Michael, she walked with a degree of stateliness and majesty that few housekeepers ever attained, through the kitchen, along the passage, across the servants' hall, into the sacred shelter of her own parlour, where she gave way to emotions which rendered a glass of prime London Madeira absolutely necessary.</p>
<p n="ENG18400243">Meanwhile Michael remained in no very happy condition in the kitchen. He was very tired, very sleepy, very thirsty, very much longing to see his mother and brother, and very greatly puzzled as to himself.</p>
<p n="ENG18400244">But though accounted to be a brave little fellow for his age, he could not muster courage enough to ask any question of those around him, and if he had, it would have been of no avail; for the very moment Mrs. Thompson was out of sight, so many of the servants began talking together, that no sounds his voice could produce would have been heard.</p>
<p n="ENG18400245">Jokes and gibes about Sir Matthew, mingled with ridiculous anecdotes, and very cordial abuse of him and all his race, furnished the first subject, and filled the first chorus. Then followed some facetious observations from Mr. Jennings concerning Mrs. Thompson, and a few of her peculiarities; and it was in the midst of the giggling which these occasioned, that the kitchen-maid ventured to say —</p>
<p n="ENG18400246">"Well, now, you are all so keen, and so clever about her, that I wonder it don't come into your heads to find out that she spoke just like an old fool and no better, when she invented all that rigmarole about the boy. Master might be just the devil you says he is, and ten times worser too, for any thing I know about him; but the worser he is, the father I'd be, if I was such a mighty good gentlewoman as she thinks herself, from giving such a bad father out of my own invention to any body — whether they comed out of the factory or not."</p>
<p n="ENG18400247">"I do think Molly's right," said one of the housemaids. — "What business has the old frump to find a father for him? Nobody asked her."</p>
<p n="ENG18400248">"That may be all very true, Rebecca," observed the lady's-maid, shaking her head very gravely. "I know well enough, that Mrs. Thompson does not always wait for right and reason before she speaks — but that makes no difference as to our having any familiarity with this dirty little boy; for it certainly does appear plain enough, that his mother is very little better than she ought to be."</p>
<p n="ENG18400249">"Lord bless us! and how much better be you than you ought to be, I should like to know?" said the fat cook, who had her own reasons for not being at all partial to Mrs. Wittington, her ladyship's waiting-maid.</p>
<p n="ENG18400250">"I! — You miserable lump of kitchen-stuff, that no man in his senses would ever deign to look upon twice! Do you dare to say that I'm no better than I ought to be?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400251">Now the cook was an Irishwoman; and though she had famous black eyes, and teeth like an elephant, her principal claim to the coveted attentions of the other sex (setting aside the attractions which it is but fair to presume her profession gave her), arose from the ready sauciness of her tongue, which, in a brogue as strong as that of the Scotch gardener, and equally dangerous for the untaught to meddle with, was wont to rattle about her, right and left, sometimes scolding, but oftener making sport of all who crossed her humour.</p>
<p n="ENG18400252">Now this virtuous outbreak of Mrs. Wittington, was too fair an opportunity to be lost; and accordingly, putting on as demure a look as her wicked eyes would let her, she replied, "You be better than you ought to be, be you? Well now, that's a trouble for your conscious, isn't it? — Is there nobody as can help her out of it? — Think what it is, gentlemen, to be so burdened, and she, poor soul, unable to confess to a priest, seeing she's a heretic! — Oh! she's better than she ought to be! and you've her own word for it too, and that's the reason you see why she's obliged, whether she will or no, to turn her back on this poor little fellow, just because he's fatherless. Isn't that a sore strait for a young lady's conscious? — Praise and glory to the Holy Virgin, and all the company of saints, now and for ever more, that I beant one bit better than I ought to be, and I hope you beant neither, Molly; and so just run to the larder, will you, girl, and bring out something for supper, fit for a hungry little boy, that havn't the misfortune to be so burdened in mind as pretty Mrs. Wittington. — Oh! the poor soul! she's better than she ought to be!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400253">Molly, the kitchen-maid, did not wait for a second order; and if a capital dish of cold cutlets could have set little Michael's heart at rest, he might then have been a very happy fellow; but, in truth, he was longing for his own porridge, by his own mother's bedside; and except from the relief afforded by a copious draught of milk, he went to the bed prepared for him by his friend, the kitchen-maid, so little elated in spirit, and so little thankful for the extraordinary change which had befallen him, that, had his noble patroness been made aware of it, she would, beyond all doubt, have punished his ingratitude, by requesting Sir Matthew to turn him out of doors again; and, moreover, have for ever abandoned the generous idea of surrounding his young head, as she poetically expressed it, with a halo of immortality, by means of getting Mr. Osmund Norval to relate his adventure in verse.</p>
<p n="ENG18400254">Sir Matthew Dowling went to his bed also, hardly better pleased with what had occurred than little Michael. But there was this difference between them: little Michael said his prayers, which the great Sir Matthew did not; but, on the contrary, spent his last waking moment in cursing, with great fervour of spirit, the folly of the hideous old maid, who had entailed such a detestable burden upon him — the result of which, as a peace-offering to the whole body of operatives, was at any rate but problematical.</p>
<p n="ENG18400255">Nevertheless, when he awoke the next morning with his head quite cool, he felt disposed to think more of the hint given him by his friend and favourite Dr. Crockley, and less of the inconvenience of having a few pounds to pay out of hundreds of thousands for a job, which, if well managed, might help, perhaps, to avert a monstrous deal of mischief.</p>
<p n="ENG18400256">With these rational thoughts working strongly in his ever-active brain, he rang his bell, and ordered that Joseph Parsons, his principal overlooker, should be sent for instantly, and shown into his study.</p>
<p n="ENG18400257">A short half-hour brought the master and man to a tête-à-tête in the snug little apartment described in the first chapter.</p>
<p n="ENG18400258">"Good morning, Parsons," said Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG18400259">The overlooker bowed his head respectfully.</p>
<p n="ENG18400260">"Have you heard any thing of this meeting at the Weavers' Arms, Parsons?" inquired Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG18400261">"As much as a man was likely to hear, Sir Matthew, who, as you will easily believe, was not intended to hear any thing," replied the confidential servant.</p>
<p n="ENG18400262">"And how much was that, Parsons? Sit down, Parsons — sit down, and let us hear all about it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400263">"I was a coming, sir, if you hadn't a sent for me," rejoined the overlooker; "for to say truth, my mind misgives me, that there's mischief brewing."</p>
<p n="ENG18400264">"I have heard as much," said the master; "but it can hardly have gone very far yet, if such a sharp-sighted fellow as you only suspect."</p>
<p n="ENG18400265">"That's true, sir," said the man, with a grim smile, in acknowledgment of the compliment; "and I've not been idle, I promise you. But all I know for certain is, that the people, old and young our own people I mean, have, one and all, taken dudgeon about that girl Stephens, that died the week before last, just after leaving the mill. She had been at work all day in the spinning-mill, and who was to guess that she was that low?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400266">"It was a d — d stupid thing though, Parsons, to have a girl go on working, and not know whether she was dying or not."</p>
<p n="ENG18400267">"And how is one to know, sir? I'll defy any man to find out, what with their tricks, and what with their real faintings."</p>
<p n="ENG18400268">"You won't tell me, Parsons, that if you set your wits to work, you can't tell whether they are shamming or not?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400269">"That's not the question, Sir Matthew, asking your pardon. There's no great difficulty in finding out whether they are in a real faint, or only making the most of being a little sickish from standing, and want of air. That's not the difficulty. The thing is to know, when they really take to the downright faintings, whether they are likely to live through it or not."</p>
<p n="ENG18400270">"And where is the great difficulty of that? You know Dr. Crockley would come at a moment's warning at any time, and feel their pulses."</p>
<p n="ENG18400271">"And he does do it, sir. But, in the first place, I doubt if any man can justly tell whether girls are likely to go on fainting, and up again, as lots and lots of 'em do for years, or drop down and die, as Nancy Stephens did. That's one thing; and another is, that Dr. Crockley is so fond of a joke, that 'tis rarely one knows when he speaks earnest, and when he does not. He did see Nancy Stephens, about a month ago, and all he said was, 'she do look a little pale in the gills, to be sure, but a dance would cure her, I have no doubt.' A dance! says I, doctor. And please to tell me, says I, how the work is to get on, if the factory boys and girls sets off dancing?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400272">"'Maybe you haven't got a fiddle?'" said he.</p>
<p n="ENG18400273">"Maybe I haven't," said I.</p>
<p n="ENG18400274">"'Well, then,' says he, 'if it don't suit you to let them dance to the fiddle, I'll bet ten to one you'll be after making 'em dance to the strap .' And with that, if you'll believe me, sir, he set off capering, and making antics, just as if there had been somebody behind a-strapping him. To be sure, it was fit to make one die of laughing to see him; but that's not the way you know, sir, to do one any good as to finding out the real condition of the people."</p>
<p n="ENG18400275">Sir Mathew could not resist a hearty laugh at this characteristic trait of his friend, but he concluded by acknowledging that Parsons was quite right in saying that this way of doing business was more agreeable than useful.</p>
<p n="ENG18400276">"However, Parsons," he continued, "we must not talk about that now, for I have something else to say to you. It is quite plain that they are getting again to their grumblings; and Crockley, who you know is up to every thing, says that he'll bet his life they have got some new mischief into their cursed heads. Now this must be prevented, Parsons, some way or other; for any harm they can do the machinery, is not the worst of it. — 'Tis the rousing up people's attention again, Parsons, there's the danger. — Just see what they've done about the blackamoor slaves, by going on boring for everlasting, ding-dong, ding-dong, till they actually got the thing done at last. Now the Philadelphy people and the Boston people are just playing the very same game t'other side the water; and when they have got their way, where will their national wealth be I should like to know? — And where will our national wealth be, when these rascals have contrived to stop the mills instead of working them?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400277">"Lord have mercy upon us! Sir Matthew; — if you don't make me creep all over to hear you!" exclaimed Parsons. "'Tis a pity, sir, and often's the time I have said it, that you arn't in parliament yourself — you'd pretty soon show 'em what their meddling with factories would do for the country."</p>
<p n="ENG18400278">"'Tis likely I might, Parsons; but a man can't be in two places at once — and depend upon it, there's good to be done here, if we knew how to set about it. I shall make you stare, perhaps, Mr. Parsons, when I tell you what I am about now. It came into my head by accident at first; but if I don't greatly mistake, I'll make a capital thing of it before I have done."</p>
<p n="ENG18400279">"There's no doubt of that, Sir Matthew, if you sets your mind to it, let it be what it will," replied the confidential overlooker; "and if it isn't a secret, sir, I should like uncommon much to hear it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400280">"No, it's no secret, Parsons — any thing in the world but that," replied Sir Matthew, laughing. "What should you say now, Mr. Superintendent, to my taking a dirty little dog of a piecer out of the factory into my own house, and dressing him, and feeding him, and lodging him, all for the love of pure benevolence, and little boys?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400281">"I don't quite understand you, sir," replied Mr. Joseph Parsons, looking very grave.</p>
<p n="ENG18400282">"No, I dare say you don't. But I think I do, Parsons, and that's more to the purpose. Trust me, man, it will do good if it's only by giving the people something to talk of just now, besides this confounded girl's death. And now, my good fellow, tell me all you know of a boy called Michael Armstrong, for he you must understand, is the hero of my tale."</p>
<p n="ENG18400283">"That's the boy, is it? — Then that's why the chap didn't come to work this morning," replied Mr. Parsons; "I knows him well enough, Sir Matthew, in course; for he's going on for eight or nine, and he comed to the factory just about five."</p>
<p n="ENG18400284">"And what sort of a boy is he, Parsons?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400285">"Nothing very particular, Sir Matthew, unless it is because of the unaccountable fuss he makes about his elder brother, who is but a poor rickety, shriveldy sort of a child. For some reason or other, his bones never seemed to come rightly straight, and this Mike makes as great a fuss about him, as if he was his grandmother."</p>
<p n="ENG18400286">"Are the parents living?" inquired Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG18400287">"The mother is. She is a bedridden woman, and ought to be in the workhouse; but she's upish, and can't abide it, and so she lies abed, doing plain work and that, and the two boys' wages maintains 'em. But I did hear t'other day, she had given in, and was a begging to go into the house, and take the eldest boy with her. These creturs never know what they would be at. I suspect, howsomever, that she has got hold of a notion, that because he's so cripply, he beant to work no more; but I shall take care to see Butchel, the parish-overseer, about it. It is altogether a trick that, what won't answer — his fingers is just as able to handle the reels, and piece the threads as ever they was; and in course, a little dwarf like him, with his legs like crooked drumsticks, can't look for any but the youngest wages; so after all, he's one of them as answers best."</p>
<p n="ENG18400288">"No! Parsons, no! ejaculated Sir Matthew with sudden energy. That woman must not go into the workhouse. The whole thing shall be got up, I tell you, in the best possible style. What d'ye say now to getting the woman arrested for debt? — or having all her things sold? — and we just stepping in at the very nick of time, to save her from destruction!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400289">There was something so truly comic in the expression of the knight's countenance, as he said this, that even the saturnine Mr. Parsons could not help laughing.</p>
<p n="ENG18400290">"If the born devils don't sing your praises through the country, sir," said he, as soon as he had recovered his gravity, "why we must find some other way to go to work with them."</p>
<p n="ENG18400291">"Now then be off, Parsons, and contrive some clever scheme or other to throw the unhappy family into a quandary."</p>
<p n="ENG18400292">"I understand, sir," said Parsons, nodding his head, and so parted the master and the man.</p>
<p n="ENG18400293">A LITTLE COTTAGE GOSSIP — A VISIT OF CHARITY — PRACTICAL BENEVOLENCE.</p>
<p n="ENG18400294">The promptitude of the measures taken by Mr. Joseph Parsons, to bring to effect the wishes of his master, showed him to be deserving the post of confidence he held, as principal superintendent of Sir Matthew Dowling's factory. He lost not a moment in obtaining a short interview with one of the parish-officers, who was his particular friend, and then made his way to Hoxley-lane, with the intention of questioning the widowed mother of the two Armstrongs, as to the situation of her affairs, and the particular species of misery from which she might, at that precise moment, be suffering the most.</p>
<p n="ENG18400295">The statement pronounced in Sir Matthew's kitchen respecting the general eligibility of Hoxley-lane as a place of residence, was perfectly correct. It was the most deplorable hole in the parish — a narrow, deep-rutted parish-road (too hopelessly bad to be indicted), led from the turnpike down a steep hill to the town of Ashleigh. Exactly at the bottom of the hill, just at the point where every summer storm and winter torrent deposited their gatherings, there to remain and be absorbed as they might, began a long, closely-packed double row of miserable dwellings, crowded to excess by the population drawn together by the neighbouring factories. There was a squalid, untrimmed look about them all, that spoke fully as much of want of care, as of want of cash in the unthrifty tribe who dwelt there. It was like the moral delinquencies of a corporate body, of which no man is ashamed, because no man can be pointed at as the guilty ONE. It was not the business of No. 1 to look after the filth accumulated in front of No. 2; and the inhabitants of No. 3, saw no use in mending the gate that swung on one hinge, because No. 4 had no gate at all; and the dogs and the pigs who made good their entry there, of course found their way easy enough through the make-believe hedge, which throughout the row divided one tenement from another. The very vilest rags were hanging before most of the doors, as demonstration that washing of garments was occasionally resorted to within. Crawling infants, half-starved cats, mangy curs, and fowls that looked as if each particular feather had been used as a scavenger's broom, shared the dust and the sunshine between them, while an odour, which seemed compounded of a multitude of villanous smells, all reeking together into one, floated over them, driving the pure untainted air of heaven aloft, far beyond the reach of any human lungs abiding in Hoxley-lane.</p>
<p n="ENG18400296">"Where does widow Armstrong live?" demanded Mr. Parsons of a woman who was whipping a child for tumbling in the dunghill before No. 5.</p>
<p n="ENG18400297">"In the back kitchen of No. 12, please your honour," replied the woman, making a low reverence to the well-known superintendent.</p>
<p n="ENG18400298">"No. 12! — why that's Sykes's tenement — and they're on the ground-floor themselves."</p>
<p n="ENG18400299">"Yes, please your honour; but since the rents have been raised by Sir Matthew, the Sykes's have been obliged to let off the back-kitchen, and live in the front one."</p>
<p n="ENG18400300">"Why there's a matter of a dozen of 'em, isn't there?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400301">"Yes, your honour, they lies terrible close."</p>
<p n="ENG18400302">"Obstinate dolt-heads! — That's just because they pretend to fancy that it is not good for the small children to work — I know, for certain, that they have got two above five years, that they won't send to the factory; and then they have the outdaciousness to complain that the rents are raised — as if because they are above choosing to earn money in an honest way, Sir Matthew was not to make what he could of his own. 'Tis disgusting to see such airs, where people ought to be thankful and happy to get work."</p>
<p n="ENG18400303">"That's quite true, no doubt, sir," answered the woman, continuing to shake, and occasionally to slap the grub of a child she had taken off the dunghill. "But Robert Sykes's children are very weakly; and them as your honour talks of, is almost too small — though 'tisn't to be doubted that it is the bounden duty of us all to send 'em, sooner than see 'em starve."</p>
<p n="ENG18400304">"I fancy so, indeed," replied Mr. Parsons; adding, with a finger pointed at the squalling child, who still continued under the cleansing process above described, "And isn't it a comfort now, Mrs. Miller, to get rid of the plague of 'em?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400305">The woman ceased to shake her little boy, and looking for a moment at the clear blue eyes that, notwithstanding her rough discipline, were very lovingly turned up to her face — something like a shudder passed over her.</p>
<p n="ENG18400306">"Get along in with you, Bill," said she, as if afraid that the blighting glance of the superintendent should rest upon him; and then added, "as long as they be so very small, your honour, they can't do no good if they be sent."</p>
<p n="ENG18400307">"Stuff and nonsense! there's ways to teach 'em. But don't fancy that I want you to send your brats — confound 'em! They're the greatest plagues in natur; and nothing on God's earth but good-heartedness and love of his country would ever make Sir Matthew, for one, trouble himself or his men with any of the creturs. — No. 12, is it, where I shall find the widow Armstrong?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400308">"Yes, please your honour — you'll be sure to find her. She's a cripple pour soul, and can't stir."</p>
<p n="ENG18400309">"She's made up her mind to go into the workhouse, hasn't she?" demanded the manager.</p>
<p n="ENG18400310">"Have she indeed, poor thing?" responded the woman, in an accent of compassion.</p>
<p n="ENG18400311">"I heard so, as I come along, and that's the reason I'm going to her. Our good Sir Matthew, who to be sure is the kindest-hearted man in the whole world, has taken a fancy to her boy, and he'll be a father to him, I'll be bound to say he will; and that's why I think he'd like me to give her a call, just to tell her not to fret herself about the workhouse. If she don't like going there, she needn't, I dare say, with such a good friend as she's got."</p>
<p n="ENG18400312">The woman stared at him with an air of such genuine astonishment, that the superintendent felt disconcerted, and turning abruptly away, continued his progress down the lane.</p>
<p n="ENG18400313">By the time he had reached No. 12, however, he had begun to doubt whether his sudden appearance at the bedside of the widow Armstrong might not produce an effect unfavourable to the object he had in view.</p>
<p n="ENG18400314">"As sure as steam's steam," thought he, "she'll be more inclined to fancy that I am come scolding about the boys for something, than to take her part, or do her pleasure; so I'll just say a civil word to the Sykeses, and then stroll away on, till such time as the parish officers have been after her. I'll engage for it, that Sam Butchel won't let no grass grow under his feet after what I said to him; and if I turn in when he's there, as if to see what was going on, it would certainly be more natural-like, and believable."</p>
<p n="ENG18400315">In accordance with this improved projet de charité , Mr. Joseph Parsons walked on; but he had not proceeded far ere, on turning his head round to reconnoitre, he perceived, not the tall and burly Sam Butchel, the overseer of the parish, but the lean and lathy person of little Michael, advancing with an eager and rapid step towards his mother's dwelling.</p>
<p n="ENG18400316">"Soh!" ejaculated the sagacious Parsons, "here comes the charity job! It would be worth a week's wages to hear him tell his own story."</p>
<p n="ENG18400317">Mr. Joseph Parsons had a Napoleon-like promptitude of action, which the unlearned operatives described by calling him "a word-and-a-blow man," but which in reality often deserved the higher epithet above bestowed.</p>
<p n="ENG18400318">Scarcely had the thought of overhearing little Michael's tale suggested itself, ere a sidelong movement ensconced him for a moment behind a favouring pig-sty, from whence, unseen, he watched the boy enter the door of No. 12.</p>
<p n="ENG18400319">Again Napoleon-like, he remembered all he had heard from her neighbour, concerning the position of the widow's dwelling-place; and rightly judging that Sykes's back-kitchen must, in some way or other, be in a condition to favour the emission of sound, he troubled not the household by making his approaches through the principal entrance, but striding over the inefficient fence of the tiny cabbage-plot behind, obtained a station as favourable to his purpose, as he could possibly desire. This was a nook between a protuberance intended for an oven, and the window close beside the widow Armstrong's bed, from whence prophetic fate, favouring the yet latent purpose of the manager, had caused three panes to be extracted by a volley of pebbles, intended for mother Sykes's cat, at least two months before.</p>
<p n="ENG18400320">To this safe and commodious crouching-place, he made his way just in time to hear the widow say, "Understand one word of Edward's story, Mike; so sit down dear boy, and tell me all."</p>
<p n="ENG18400321">"Why mother, 'tis like a story-book — and it's very fine to be sure — but yet — " And the boy stopped short.</p>
<p n="ENG18400322">"But yet you don't like it, Mike?" rejoined his mother. "That's what you was going to say. Tell the truth, my child, and don't go to keep nothing from me."</p>
<p n="ENG18400323">"That was it," said Mike.</p>
<p n="ENG18400324">"Ungrateful viper!" muttered the confidential superintendent between his closed teeth.</p>
<p n="ENG18400325">"Poor fellow! poor dear Michael!" exclaimed the woman, soothingly. "It was hard to go to sleep without kissing mother, wasn't it?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400326">"Yes, I didn't like that — nor I didn't like being without Teddy neither — and I didn't like the grumpy old lady as comed into the kitchen, and abused me; nor the gentlemen servants either, except the gardener, and he took hold of my hand, and led me along kind enough — and I like Molly too, that's she as give me my supper and my bed, and my breakfast this morning, mother. Oh, mother! how I did long to bring away some of the milk and bread and butter home with me!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400327">"Never think of such a thing, for your life, boy!" exclaimed the mother eagerly. "It would be thieving, nothing else, Michael — nothing more nor less than thieving — never mention that again to me, dear, that's a darling."</p>
<p n="ENG18400328">"I won't, mother; but I know I shall think of it every time I see them big pounds of butter, and jugs of milk, and minds how careful you be over your little scrimped bit in the broken saucer, and how you drinks your drop of tea without ever having any milk at all."</p>
<p n="ENG18400329">"Never you mind that, darling. But what are they going to do with you, Mike? And what for do they want to have you up at the great house? 'Tis a mystery to me, and thankful as we ought to be for any help, I can't say but I should be easier in my mind, if I understood something about it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400330">"Impertinent hag!" growled the surly Parsons from his lair. "Does she think they are going to trap him like a rabbit, for the sake of his skin?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400331">"But, mother, I don't understand any thing about it myself," said Michael, rather dolefully.</p>
<p n="ENG18400332">To this avowal, no reply was made for some minutes; upon which the superintendent grew impatient, and stretching forward his neck a little, contrived athwart the sheltering branches of an elder-bush, to peep through the broken window.</p>
<p n="ENG18400333">To the agent of Sir Matthew Dowling's benevolence the sight that presented itself was really revolting; though there may be others who would have been affected differently by it. Michael had flung himself across the bed; his arms were thrown round his mother, who was sitting upright with some piece of needlework in her hands, and his dark curls set off in strong contrast the extreme paleness of the face that looked down upon him. The widow Armstrong was still rather a young woman, and would still have been a very lovely one, had not sickness and poor living sharpened the delicate features, and destroyed the oval outline that nature had made perfect. Yet she had quite enough of beauty left to detain the eye; and such a history of patient suffering might be read in every line of her speaking countenance, that few ever looked upon her harshly. Spite of her extreme poverty too, she was clean — her cap was clean, the bedclothes were clean, and the pale hands too, looked so very white, that if Mr. Parsons from his hiding-place had ventured to speak any opinion concerning her, he would certainly have given utterance to a strong expression of indignation, at the abominable air of delicacy which her appearance displayed.</p>
<p n="ENG18400334">She looked as if she were struggling with some painful feeling, but did not weep, though her boy did, heartily.</p>
<p n="ENG18400335">For a little while she suffered his tears to flow without interruption or reproof, and then she kissed him once, twice, thrice.</p>
<p n="ENG18400336">"There now, Michael," she said, looking at him fondly; "have you not played baby long enough? Stand up, darling, and listen to me. You don't seem over-glad, Mike, of this great change, and if you did, perhaps I might have been over-sorry; but sorrow would be sin for either of us, when God has sent us help. 'Tis you that be the heartiest Mike, and 'tis you that want food the most, growing at the rate you do, and heart-sore have I been at meal-times to see you so stinted. So never let us trouble ourselves any more about the reasons for your getting so into favour, but just thank God, and be contented."</p>
<p n="ENG18400337">"But mother! How will you get on without me?" replied Michael, shaking his head; "I am sure that Teddy can't make your bed as I do — he hasn't the strength in his arms. And who's to fetch water? 'Deed and 'deed mother, you'd better thank Sir Matthew, and say no, unless he'll just please to let Teddy go instead."</p>
<p n="ENG18400338">"That won't do my dear child, in any way. 'Tis I must watch poor Edward. Little as I can do for him, I don't think he'd like to part from me, as long as God is pleased to let me stay."</p>
<p n="ENG18400339">"That's true mother — that's very true! Teddy would break his heart. No, no, 'tisn't he shall be parted from you; I'll show him how to make the bed, if I can't come over myself; but perhaps they'll let me, mother?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400340">"What's the business that you'll have to do, Michael?" inquired the widow.</p>
<p n="ENG18400341">"I haven't been told of any business yet," replied the boy.</p>
<p n="ENG18400342">"But you don't expect that you're going to be kept for nothing, dear?" said the mother, smiling.</p>
<p n="ENG18400343">"'Tisn't for my work, mother; 'tis for the cow," replied Michael, gravely.</p>
<p n="ENG18400344">"The cow, child? What is it you and Teddy have got into your heads about a cow? A poor starved beast, he says it was, that wouldn't have frightened a mouse, and you made it turn round, Mike — that's all I can make out. But he must be mistaken surely. What was it you did about the cow, darling?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400345">At this question, the boy burst into a hearty fit of laughter, which to say truth, offended the listening ears of Mr. Joseph Parsons, still more than his weeping had done.</p>
<p n="ENG18400346">"I'll do his business for him, he may depend upon it," thought he. "If master must have a charity job, he must; but it don't follow that the cretur shan't be made to know himself just as well as if he was in the factory. I'll be your overlooker yet, master Mike."</p>
<p n="ENG18400347">Just as this prophetic sketching of the future had made itself distinctly visible to his mind's eye, the bodily senses of the agent announced to him that the tranquil tête-à-tête within the widow's chamber was disturbed by the entrance of persons, whose voice and step announced that they were men. Mr. Parsons was at no loss to guess their errand. "Here they come!" muttered he. "Now we'll see how Master Butchel manages his job.</p>
<p n="ENG18400348">"We be commed to see," said a gruff voice within the widow's chamber, "whether or no you be commed to your senses, Mrs. Armstrong."</p>
<p n="ENG18400349">"Sir?" said the trembling woman in return.</p>
<p n="ENG18400350">"You knows well enough what I means, without my going into it again; you knows well enough as I comes to talk to ye about the house again. We've had Larkins the baker, coming to inquire if there's parish pay to look to, for your bill, Mrs. Armstrong — and I have told him, NO, not a farthing, not the quarter of a farthing, unless you'll come into the house. The parish have gone on allowing you two shilling a week, week after week, God knows how long — 'tis a perfect shame and imposition, and the board says they won't do it no longer. You and the boys too may come in if you will, that's one thing; but living here, cramming 'em with as much wheaten bread as they'll eat without paying for it, is another, and it's what no honest parish don't tolerate. I'll be bound to say now, as you have brought up the scamps without their ever knowing the taste of gruel? Tell the truth, did you ever take the trouble to make a drop of gruel for 'em?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400351">"As long as I had my legs to stand upon, sir, I never minded trouble; and, when my husband was living, we did a deal better, and I have done cooking for 'em then, such as a few potatoes and a cabbage, may be, with a scrap of bacon on a Sunday; but, from the hour he died, we have never had a pot upon the fire."</p>
<p n="ENG18400352">"That's what 'tis to be so obstinate. If you'd come into the house you'd see the pot upon the fire all day long, a'most."</p>
<p n="ENG18400353">"But the children would be in one room, after they came from the factory, and I should be in another," pleaded the widow, "and I've got a few of the decent things as I married with, when I came from service, and it would be a grief to me to see 'em all sold."</p>
<p n="ENG18400354">"If the parish don't sell 'em, Larkins the baker will, you may take my word for that, Mrs. Armstrong," replied the overseer. "However, 'tis your business, not mine. Here's a decent, respectable man, as is ready to take all you've got at a valiation, fair and honourable, but that's just as you please. I only called, as in duty bound, to tell ye that the parish don't mean to continy no such extravagance as paying you two shilling a week, no longer."</p>
<p n="ENG18400355">"God help me!" answered the widow gently. "If 'tis his will that so it should be, it would be a sin for me to complain."</p>
<p n="ENG18400356">"That's vastly fine, beant it?" said the brutal Butchel, "and now let's hear what you'll be after saying to Master Larkins, for here he comes, as sure as eggs be eggs."</p>
<p n="ENG18400357">An abrupt, and most peremptory demand, for three pounds two shillings and seven pence, was here made, by a sour-looking little man, who entered the small room without ceremony, making a group of intruders round the widows bed, equally unwonted and unwelcome. Her over-taxed courage seemed to fail, for it was with something like a sob that she replied to his demand by saying, "I shall have twelve shillings to take for needlework, when this is done, and you shall have it every farthing sir, if you'll be so merciful."</p>
<p n="ENG18400358">"And who's to pay your rent, Missis Armstrong? if I may be so bold," said Mr. Butchel.</p>
<p n="ENG18400359">The widow had not a word to say for herself, and, covering her face with her hands, wept bitterly.</p>
<p n="ENG18400360">"Now's my time!" said Parsons to himself, as he stealthily crept from his hiding-place. "Now for Sir Matthew's benevolence." And, in a minute afterwards, his tall, gaunt figure, and hard countenance, were added to the company. The noise he made in entering, caused the widow to uncover her eyes, and it was with an emotion little short of terror that she recognised the tyrant, at whose name her children's cheeks grew pale. Instinctively she stretched out her hand, and took hold of that of Michael, who was still seated on the side of the bed. But the boy shook it off, as if his mother's love was a secret treasure that the overlooker must not see, and, suddenly standing up, he remained, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and his hands hanging by his sides, as if petrified.</p>
<p n="ENG18400361">"Hollo! — why what's the matter now? Is all the parish come to wish joy to this good woman here?" said the overlooker, with as jocund an air as he could persuade his iron features to assume.</p>
<p n="ENG18400362">"Wish her joy?" responded the well-tutored parish-officer, "and for what, Mr. Parsons, if you please? For having an honest tradesman come upon her with the gripe of the law, in hopes to get what's his own? She's got into trouble, I promise you, and I don't very well see how she's to get out of it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400363">"You don't say so?" said the confidential agent. "What! is that you, Mr. Larkins, coming to take the law of a poor body this way? I didn't think you was so hard-hearted."</p>
<p n="ENG18400364">"I don't deserve that character, sir," replied the baker sharply; for though desired to call and enforce his claim by the parish overseer, Mr. Larkins knew not a word about Sir Matthew's scheme of benevolence; "and the proof that my heart isn't harder than other people's" he continued, "is, that I gave the widow here credit for what has been, excepting a few ounces of tea, her whole and sole living for months past."</p>
<p n="ENG18400365">"And very kind of ye too," observed the conciliating superintendent.</p>
<p n="ENG18400366">"I should like to know, then, what became of all the money the two boys got, besides her own needlework, and, of late, two shilling a week from the parish, beside?" observed Mr. Butchel.</p>
<p n="ENG18400367">"Why, that is rather puzzling, I must say," replied Mr. Parsons, "but no matter for that, no matter for that, just now. This family have got a kind friend, I promise you."</p>
<p n="ENG18400368">"Yes, but it does matter," returned Larkins. "It can't be right, no how, for me to be out of three pounds two shillings and seven pence, and she with such lots of money."</p>
<p n="ENG18400369">"Indeed, indeed, sir!" said the widow, once more looking up at him, "I have done my very best, paying a little and a little at a time, as you know I never stopped doing, only for two weeks that my biggest — that is my oldest boy, was making up time that was lost, when he was home sick, and so got no wages. But the seven shillings a week that they get between 'em, and my uncertain bit of needle-work, gentlemen, can't stand for food, and clothes, and rent' — and a little soap to keep us decent, and a bit of firing to boil a drop of water — it can't do all that, gentlemen, without getting behindhand, when any making up time comes in the factory."</p>
<p n="ENG18400370">"Well then, that's just the reason why you must come into the house," replied Butchel; "and, at any rate, you may depend upon getting no more money out of it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400371">Upon hearing these words, "the decent, respectable man," who was willing to take the widow's goods, at a "valiation fair and honourable," began examining the condition of a chair that stood near him; an operation which the widow eyed with the most piteous look imaginable.</p>
<p n="ENG18400372">"Come into the house, I tell you, without more ado," resumed Butchel. "And what, in God's name, d'ye think we want you in for but your own good? D'ye think the parish have a fancy for maintaining crippled women and children, by way of a pleasure? 'Tis ruination any way; but when you're in, we know the worst of it at once, and that's something. The boys' wages will go a bit to help, and at any rate there'll be no two shillings to pay, which is what the overseers hates above all things; and what they won't continy to do. So now I have said my say."</p>
<p n="ENG18400373">And here Mr. Butchel began to move his heavy person towards the door.</p>
<p n="ENG18400374">"Stop a minute, Mr. Butchel, if you please sir," ejaculated Sir Matthew's superintendent. "I should be sorry to let you go back to your employers under any delusion or mistake whatever, and the fact is, that this good woman, the widow Armstrong, is no more likely to go into the workhouse than you are yourself, Mr. Butchel; begging your pardon for naming such a thing."</p>
<p n="ENG18400375">"Then I suppose as it's yourself as means to keep her out of it, Mr. Parsons?" replied the parish officer jocosely.</p>
<p n="ENG18400376">"Not exactly me, myself," replied the other in the same tone, "but it's one as much more able as he is willing. It is Sir Matthew Dowling as intends to befriend her, and that not only on account of the general charitableness of his temper, which all who know him really well are quite aware is very great, but because that little boy as stands there, and who is one of our factory children, saved a friend of Lady Dowling's, last night, from something she looked upon to be a considerable danger."</p>
<p n="ENG18400377">"And does Sir Matthew mean to see me paid?" demanded the baker.</p>
<p n="ENG18400378">"Upon my word, Mr. Larkin, that's more than what I've got authority to say," replied Parsons; "but, howsomever, I don't think that you had best go on, just at this particular minute, to persecute about it, seeing that in course Sir Matthew won't take it civil, when he's being such a friend himself to the widow."</p>
<p n="ENG18400379">"I don't want to do nothing uncivil to nobody," replied the baker, "but I don't quite understand this business. It is something new, isn't it, Sir Matthew setting up for a soft-hearted gentleman, among the factory folks?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400380">"New to you, may be, Mr. Larkin, but not to me," replied the trustworthy agent. "There isn't another to be found, look which way you will, that can be compared with Sir Matthew Dowling, for real, true, benevolent, charitableness, when he finds proper objects for it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400381">The baker stared; the man of old chairs and tables scratched his puzzled head; the intelligent Mr. Butchel looked at the speaker with a knowing wink; the widow fixed her eyes upon her patchwork quilt; and little Michael in astonishment, which conquered terror, raised his eyes to the superintendent's face, while that worthy advocate of a master's virtues stood firmly, striking his stout cane upon the ground, with the air of a man ready to do battle with all the world in support of what he has asserted.</p>
<p n="ENG18400382">"Well then, at any rate my business is done and ended," said Mr. Butchel moving off, "and I wish you joy Mussiss Armstrong of your unaccountable good fortune."</p>
<p n="ENG18400383">"Come along, Jim!" said the baker to the respectable dealer in seized goods, "there's nothing to be done to-day, that's clear. But I hope you'll remember the twelve shillings as you've promised me, Mrs. Armstrong."</p>
<p n="ENG18400384">"I will indeed, sir!" answered the widow earnestly; and, on receiving this assurance, Mr. Larkin took his departure with his professional friend, leaving Mr. Joseph Parsons, the widow Armstrong, and her son Michael to carry on whatever conversation they might wish for, without interruption.</p>
<p n="ENG18400385">"Well now, if I ain't glad they're gone, them fellows," said the superintendent shutting the door after them. "You are a favoured woman, Mrs. Armstrong, to get rid of 'em as you have done, and I don't and won't, question that you are thankful to those to whom thanks are due."</p>
<p n="ENG18400386">"I always wish to be so, sir," said the widow.</p>
<p n="ENG18400387">"Well, there's no hardship in that I suppose. But about this son of yours, this young Master Michael, you must see to his doing his duty to his benefactor. If he was to prove ungrateful, Mrs. Armstrong, it is but fair to tell you that I wouldn't undertake to answer for the consequences."</p>
<p n="ENG18400388">"God forbid he ever should be ungrateful to any as was kind to him!" replied the poor woman; "but indeed, sir, I don't think it is in his heart to be so. Since the day he was born, God bless him, I have had little besides love to give him, and indeed, sir, I think the child would die for me."</p>
<p n="ENG18400389">Michael slily stole his little hand sideways under the bedclothes, where it was soon clasped in that of his mother, but his eyes were again firmly rivetted upon the ground.</p>
<p n="ENG18400390">"Ay, ay, that's all very well; but it has nothing to do in any way with his duty and obligations to Sir Matthew. What I want to know is, whether he is ready and willing to do that which Sir Matthew will require of him — that's the main question, you see, Mrs. Armstrong."</p>
<p n="ENG18400391">"And what will that be, sir?" said the widow, while Michael's eyes were again raised for a moment to the face of his taskmaster.</p>
<p n="ENG18400392">"He is to be made a gentleman of — that's to be the first work put upon him." The poor woman smiled; but little Michael shook his head. The superintendent appeared to pay no attention to either; but again striking his cane magisterially upon the ground, he added, "Let him make up his mind to do all that he's bid, and come back to Dowling Lodge with as little delay as possible."</p>
<p n="ENG18400393">With these words, and without deigning to bestow any species of parting salutation upon those to whom they were addressed, Mr. Parsons left the room.</p>
<p n="ENG18400394">A SEPARATION OF LOVING HEARTS — A SPECIMEN OF FINISHED COMPOSITION — CONDESCENSION AND GENEROSITY — SIR MATTHEW CLOTHES LITTLE MICHAEL WITH HIS OWN HANDS.</p>
<p n="ENG18400395">While the superintendent, in his serpentine course homeward, scattered the tidings of his master's munificence towards the factory-boy, Michael Armstrong and his mother indulged themselves in a few parting words and very tender caresses; the mother continuing to repeat at intervals, "Be sure, darling, to be a good boy, and do what you're bid," while the son reiterated his entreaties that she and Teddy would take care one of t'other, and have him back again, spite of every thing, if they found that they could not do so well without him.</p>
<p n="ENG18400396">But even while this went on, Michael was improving his toilet by putting on the more carefully patched garments, which had hitherto been kept sacred for Sundays. When this operation was completed, and his hair, face, and hands made as clean as the joint efforts of himself and his mother could contrive to make them, the little boy turned to leave the miserable shed that had been his home, with a reluctant step and heavy heart, retracing the short distance between his mother's bed and the door, once and again to take another kiss, and to repeat, with increased earnestness, the questions, "Isn't there nothing more I can do for you, mother, before I go away? — and will you be sure to tell Teddy to stop for me, morning and night, at the gate in the lane, where it all happened? — will you mother?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400397">But at length the lingering separation was completed, and Michael set off upon his return to Dowling Lodge. In the mean time, Sir Matthew himself had not been idle; but, retiring to his study, he composed a paragraph for the county newspaper, which, after considerable study and repeated corrections, was at length completed, and despatched by the post, in a feigned hand, the wax being stamped with the handle of the seal instead of his arms, and the postage paid.</p>
<p n="ENG18400398">The paragraph ran thus:</p>
<p n="ENG18400399">"There is, perhaps, no class of men so cruelly misrepresented as the manufacturers of Great Britain; surrounded on all sides by a population of labourers, crowded together exactly in proportion to the quantity of work the neighbouring factories are able to furnish — they are continually reproached both with giving to many hours of employment to their poor neighbours on the one hand, and with the poverty which is the inevitable lot of operatives with large families on the other.</p>
<p n="ENG18400400">"That all manufacturers, however, are not the cruel mercenary tyrants they are so often, and so unjustly described to be, was shown within the last few days by an incident which occurred near the town of Ashleigh, not a hundred miles from D — I — g L — d — e. The owner of that splendid mansion, while escorting the amiable Lady — round his grounds, had occasion to remark some symptoms of a very noble disposition in one of the children belonging to a neighbouring factory on his estate. On making inquiries, he discovered him to be the son of a poor widow, whose failing health made her, and her orphan children peculiarly eligible as objects of charity. This fact having been satisfactorily ascertained, Sir M — th — w D — l — g gave way to the warm impulses of his generous heart, and adopting the little orphan among his own children, at once gratified the gentle feelings of his amiable nature, and set them an example which it is impossible they should ever forget. It is more easy for the recorder of this charming anecdote to relate thus the principal circumstances of it, than to enter into any detail of the numberless delicate traits of character exhibited by Sir M. D — l — g in the course of the transaction. Those who know him thoroughly, will, however, be at no loss how to supply these; and those who do not, would scarcely understand the description, were it given with all the detail possible."</p>
<p n="ENG18400401">The value and the accuracy of the statements contained in this announcement, belonged wholly to the author of it; the phraseology to a private MS. digest of newspaper eloquence, the result of many years of steady research, during which no morsel of fine writing that might assist in such occasional addresses to the public as the present, had been ever suffered to flow down the stream of time, and perish, without having been first carefully noted in the knight's repertory of fine periods.</p>
<p n="ENG18400402">Having concluded this business, Sir Matthew Dowling rang his bell. As it was only the study-bell, it was answered, as usual, by one of the housemaids.</p>
<p n="ENG18400403">"Where is the little boy, my dear, that I sent into the servants' hall last night?" inquired Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG18400404">"Upon my word, Sir Matthew, I can't tell," she replied; adding, in that tone of familiar confidence which her master's condescension encouraged, "but if you sent him into the hall, Sir Matthew, he never got there, nor never will, you may take my word for that, as long as Madam Thompson reigns."</p>
<p n="ENG18400405">The housemaid was not a beauty — none such, as was before stated, ever made part of Lady Dowling's household; but she was a wit, and Sir Matthew was to clever himself not to feel the value of cleverness in others; he, therefore, raised his eyebrows in a comic grimace, very good-humouredly chucked the maid under her ugly chin, and instead of putting himself in a rage, as might have happened under other circumstances, he only said, "And how was that my dear? Come, tell me all about it — I like your stories, Peggy, they are always so funny."</p>
<p n="ENG18400406">"Whose stories wouldn't he funny, Sir Matthew, if they told of the airs and graces of Mother Thompson!" replied the jively damsel; "she's for all the world like an old owl, as sits winking his eyes and trying to look wise."</p>
<p n="ENG18400407">"But she's a prime favourite with my lady, Peggy, and into the bargain, knows a thing or two about soups and hashes; so we must be very respectful, my dear, in talking of her — but as to her daring to say, that the boy I ordered into the hall was to be turned out of it, that's rather more than possible, I think."</p>
<p n="ENG18400408">"That's because you don't know Mrs. Thompson, Sir Matthew. I only wish you had heard and seen 'em last night, she, and the butler, and Mrs. Fine Airs, my lady's maid, and Mr. Fine Airs, my lady's footman! If it was not enough to make one sick, I wish I may never see you again, Sir Matthew."</p>
<p n="ENG18400409">"They are a confounded impertinent set of rubbish," replied Sir Matthew; but still without losing his good humour. "However, all people of fashion, that is, rich people, Peggy, always do have a confounded impertinent set of servants about 'em. That's one of the great differences between high people and low."</p>
<p n="ENG18400410">"To be sure you must know best, Sir Matthew," replied the saucy grisette, but with a look and accent somewhat ironical. "I don't mean to doubt that in the least, I'm sure; but in the places I've lived at — Lord Wilmot's, Lord Crampton's, and such like, I never did hear of my lord's commands being treated in that fashion. They might have their jokes in the hall, and the housekeeper's room too, no doubt of it, and impudent enough if you like it; but for downright flat disobedience, I never did hear of such a thing."</p>
<p n="ENG18400411">Sir Matthew on hearing this, became rather white about the lips, and red about the forehead; but Peggy knew the rising storm was not at all likely to fall on her, so nothing daunted, she went on.</p>
<p n="ENG18400412">"I don't think I should have taken much notice about it, Sir Matthew, if it hadn't been for not liking to see you treated with disrespect; for I'm not over and above partial to beggar children myself; but that sort of natural dislike was nothing in comparison to my feelings about you, sir: and if I had been placed in power, instead of having none, your will would have been obeyed, if every servant in the house had flowed at me for it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400413">"You're an excellent girl, Peggy," replied the knight, approaching her very condescendingly. "You know well enough that you are a favourite, and I know well enough, my dear, that you deserve to be so; and I tell you what, Peggy, I'll take care to let those animals, my servants, know that I am master here, as well as in the factory — and that my word's law!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400414">"And so it ought to be, Sir Matthew," replied the obedient domestic. "I hope I know my duty too well to dispute my master's will in any thing;" and as she spoke she very meekly yielded herself to receive the condescending salute, with which Sir Matthew was pleased to reward her excellent sentiments.</p>
<p n="ENG18400415">"You are an excellent good girl, Peggy!" he resumed after this little interruption; "and don't fear but I shall find means to reward you. But you must give me your help, my dear, to confound the impertinence of these fellow-servants of yours; if I don't make 'em wait upon that beggar's brat as if he was their lord and master, never trust me with a kiss more. Where is the little factory vermin, Peggy?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400416">"I ain't able to answer you, Sir Matthew; all I know is, that Mrs. Thompson marched us all out of the kitchen where she sat in judgment on him, last night, and there he was left with the kitchen-maid and the fat cook; but what's come of him since, I am no ways able to say."</p>
<p n="ENG18400417">On hearing this, Sir Matthew raised his hand towards the bell, but suddenly recollecting himself, he smiled and said, "No, no, that won't do, Peggy, will it? Go, my dear, and ask where the boy is, and then come back and tell me."</p>
<p n="ENG18400418">The damsel, in return, furtively smiled too, in acquiescence and approval of his discretion; and upon leaving his study for the purpose of prosecuting her inquiries among the servants, she encountered the object of them, as he entered the back-door, on his return from visiting his mother's cottage.</p>
<p n="ENG18400419">"Soh! here you are then? Well, you must come along this minute to Sir Matthew," said she, addressing him somewhat gruffly, and not too well pleased, perhaps, at this interruption to the confidential conversation with her master, which it had been her purpose to renew. But to the ears of Michael, the name of Sir Matthew was sufficient to render all other words indifferent; and conscious only, that into his dreaded presence he must go if commanded to do so, he followed the girl with a beating heart, and in a few minutes stood pale, and almost breathless, before the awful countenance of the great man.</p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG18400387">"Well, there's no hardship in that I suppose. But about this son of yours, this young Master Michael, you must see to his doing his duty to his benefactor. If he was to prove ungrateful, Mrs. Armstrong, it is but fair to tell you that I wouldn't undertake to answer for the consequences."</p>
<p n="ENG18400388">"God forbid he ever should be ungrateful to any as was kind to him!" replied the poor woman; "but indeed, sir, I don't think it is in his heart to be so. Since the day he was born, God bless him, I have had little besides love to give him, and indeed, sir, I think the child would die for me."</p>
<p n="ENG18400389">Michael slily stole his little hand sideways under the bedclothes, where it was soon clasped in that of his mother, but his eyes were again firmly rivetted upon the ground.</p>
<p n="ENG18400390">"Ay, ay, that's all very well; but it has nothing to do in any way with his duty and obligations to Sir Matthew. What I want to know is, whether he is ready and willing to do that which Sir Matthew will require of him — that's the main question, you see, Mrs. Armstrong."</p>
<p n="ENG18400391">"And what will that be, sir?" said the widow, while Michael's eyes were again raised for a moment to the face of his taskmaster.</p>
<p n="ENG18400392">"He is to be made a gentleman of — that's to be the first work put upon him." The poor woman smiled; but little Michael shook his head. The superintendent appeared to pay no attention to either; but again striking his cane magisterially upon the ground, he added, "Let him make up his mind to do all that he's bid, and come back to Dowling Lodge with as little delay as possible."</p>
<p n="ENG18400393">With these words, and without deigning to bestow any species of parting salutation upon those to whom they were addressed, Mr. Parsons left the room.</p>
<p n="ENG18400394">A SEPARATION OF LOVING HEARTS — A SPECIMEN OF FINISHED COMPOSITION — CONDESCENSION AND GENEROSITY — SIR MATTHEW CLOTHES LITTLE MICHAEL WITH HIS OWN HANDS.</p>
<p n="ENG18400395">While the superintendent, in his serpentine course homeward, scattered the tidings of his master's munificence towards the factory-boy, Michael Armstrong and his mother indulged themselves in a few parting words and very tender caresses; the mother continuing to repeat at intervals, "Be sure, darling, to be a good boy, and do what you're bid," while the son reiterated his entreaties that she and Teddy would take care one of t'other, and have him back again, spite of every thing, if they found that they could not do so well without him.</p>
<p n="ENG18400396">But even while this went on, Michael was improving his toilet by putting on the more carefully patched garments, which had hitherto been kept sacred for Sundays. When this operation was completed, and his hair, face, and hands made as clean as the joint efforts of himself and his mother could contrive to make them, the little boy turned to leave the miserable shed that had been his home, with a reluctant step and heavy heart, retracing the short distance between his mother's bed and the door, once and again to take another kiss, and to repeat, with increased earnestness, the questions, "Isn't there nothing more I can do for you, mother, before I go away? — and will you be sure to tell Teddy to stop for me, morning and night, at the gate in the lane, where it all happened? — will you mother?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400397">But at length the lingering separation was completed, and Michael set off upon his return to Dowling Lodge. In the mean time, Sir Matthew himself had not been idle; but, retiring to his study, he composed a paragraph for the county newspaper, which, after considerable study and repeated corrections, was at length completed, and despatched by the post, in a feigned hand, the wax being stamped with the handle of the seal instead of his arms, and the postage paid.</p>
<p n="ENG18400398">The paragraph ran thus:</p>
<p n="ENG18400399">"There is, perhaps, no class of men so cruelly misrepresented as the manufacturers of Great Britain; surrounded on all sides by a population of labourers, crowded together exactly in proportion to the quantity of work the neighbouring factories are able to furnish — they are continually reproached both with giving to many hours of employment to their poor neighbours on the one hand, and with the poverty which is the inevitable lot of operatives with large families on the other.</p>
<p n="ENG18400400">"That all manufacturers, however, are not the cruel mercenary tyrants they are so often, and so unjustly described to be, was shown within the last few days by an incident which occurred near the town of Ashleigh, not a hundred miles from D — I — g L — d — e. The owner of that splendid mansion, while escorting the amiable Lady — round his grounds, had occasion to remark some symptoms of a very noble disposition in one of the children belonging to a neighbouring factory on his estate. On making inquiries, he discovered him to be the son of a poor widow, whose failing health made her, and her orphan children peculiarly eligible as objects of charity. This fact having been satisfactorily ascertained, Sir M — th — w D — l — g gave way to the warm impulses of his generous heart, and adopting the little orphan among his own children, at once gratified the gentle feelings of his amiable nature, and set them an example which it is impossible they should ever forget. It is more easy for the recorder of this charming anecdote to relate thus the principal circumstances of it, than to enter into any detail of the numberless delicate traits of character exhibited by Sir M. D — l — g in the course of the transaction. Those who know him thoroughly, will, however, be at no loss how to supply these; and those who do not, would scarcely understand the description, were it given with all the detail possible."</p>
<p n="ENG18400401">The value and the accuracy of the statements contained in this announcement, belonged wholly to the author of it; the phraseology to a private MS. digest of newspaper eloquence, the result of many years of steady research, during which no morsel of fine writing that might assist in such occasional addresses to the public as the present, had been ever suffered to flow down the stream of time, and perish, without having been first carefully noted in the knight's repertory of fine periods.</p>
<p n="ENG18400402">Having concluded this business, Sir Matthew Dowling rang his bell. As it was only the study-bell, it was answered, as usual, by one of the housemaids.</p>
<p n="ENG18400403">"Where is the little boy, my dear, that I sent into the servants' hall last night?" inquired Sir Matthew.</p>
<p n="ENG18400404">"Upon my word, Sir Matthew, I can't tell," she replied; adding, in that tone of familiar confidence which her master's condescension encouraged, "but if you sent him into the hall, Sir Matthew, he never got there, nor never will, you may take my word for that, as long as Madam Thompson reigns."</p>
<p n="ENG18400405">The housemaid was not a beauty — none such, as was before stated, ever made part of Lady Dowling's household; but she was a wit, and Sir Matthew was to clever himself not to feel the value of cleverness in others; he, therefore, raised his eyebrows in a comic grimace, very good-humouredly chucked the maid under her ugly chin, and instead of putting himself in a rage, as might have happened under other circumstances, he only said, "And how was that my dear? Come, tell me all about it — I like your stories, Peggy, they are always so funny."</p>
<p n="ENG18400406">"Whose stories wouldn't he funny, Sir Matthew, if they told of the airs and graces of Mother Thompson!" replied the jively damsel; "she's for all the world like an old owl, as sits winking his eyes and trying to look wise."</p>
<p n="ENG18400407">"But she's a prime favourite with my lady, Peggy, and into the bargain, knows a thing or two about soups and hashes; so we must be very respectful, my dear, in talking of her — but as to her daring to say, that the boy I ordered into the hall was to be turned out of it, that's rather more than possible, I think."</p>
<p n="ENG18400408">"That's because you don't know Mrs. Thompson, Sir Matthew. I only wish you had heard and seen 'em last night, she, and the butler, and Mrs. Fine Airs, my lady's maid, and Mr. Fine Airs, my lady's footman! If it was not enough to make one sick, I wish I may never see you again, Sir Matthew."</p>
<p n="ENG18400409">"They are a confounded impertinent set of rubbish," replied Sir Matthew; but still without losing his good humour. "However, all people of fashion, that is, rich people, Peggy, always do have a confounded impertinent set of servants about 'em. That's one of the great differences between high people and low."</p>
<p n="ENG18400410">"To be sure you must know best, Sir Matthew," replied the saucy grisette, but with a look and accent somewhat ironical. "I don't mean to doubt that in the least, I'm sure; but in the places I've lived at — Lord Wilmot's, Lord Crampton's, and such like, I never did hear of my lord's commands being treated in that fashion. They might have their jokes in the hall, and the housekeeper's room too, no doubt of it, and impudent enough if you like it; but for downright flat disobedience, I never did hear of such a thing."</p>
<p n="ENG18400411">Sir Matthew on hearing this, became rather white about the lips, and red about the forehead; but Peggy knew the rising storm was not at all likely to fall on her, so nothing daunted, she went on.</p>
<p n="ENG18400412">"I don't think I should have taken much notice about it, Sir Matthew, if it hadn't been for not liking to see you treated with disrespect; for I'm not over and above partial to beggar children myself; but that sort of natural dislike was nothing in comparison to my feelings about you, sir: and if I had been placed in power, instead of having none, your will would have been obeyed, if every servant in the house had flowed at me for it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400413">"You're an excellent girl, Peggy," replied the knight, approaching her very condescendingly. "You know well enough that you are a favourite, and I know well enough, my dear, that you deserve to be so; and I tell you what, Peggy, I'll take care to let those animals, my servants, know that I am master here, as well as in the factory — and that my word's law!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400414">"And so it ought to be, Sir Matthew," replied the obedient domestic. "I hope I know my duty too well to dispute my master's will in any thing;" and as she spoke she very meekly yielded herself to receive the condescending salute, with which Sir Matthew was pleased to reward her excellent sentiments.</p>
<p n="ENG18400415">"You are an excellent good girl, Peggy!" he resumed after this little interruption; "and don't fear but I shall find means to reward you. But you must give me your help, my dear, to confound the impertinence of these fellow-servants of yours; if I don't make 'em wait upon that beggar's brat as if he was their lord and master, never trust me with a kiss more. Where is the little factory vermin, Peggy?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400416">"I ain't able to answer you, Sir Matthew; all I know is, that Mrs. Thompson marched us all out of the kitchen where she sat in judgment on him, last night, and there he was left with the kitchen-maid and the fat cook; but what's come of him since, I am no ways able to say."</p>
<p n="ENG18400417">On hearing this, Sir Matthew raised his hand towards the bell, but suddenly recollecting himself, he smiled and said, "No, no, that won't do, Peggy, will it? Go, my dear, and ask where the boy is, and then come back and tell me."</p>
<p n="ENG18400418">The damsel, in return, furtively smiled too, in acquiescence and approval of his discretion; and upon leaving his study for the purpose of prosecuting her inquiries among the servants, she encountered the object of them, as he entered the back-door, on his return from visiting his mother's cottage.</p>
<p n="ENG18400419">"Soh! here you are then? Well, you must come along this minute to Sir Matthew," said she, addressing him somewhat gruffly, and not too well pleased, perhaps, at this interruption to the confidential conversation with her master, which it had been her purpose to renew. But to the ears of Michael, the name of Sir Matthew was sufficient to render all other words indifferent; and conscious only, that into his dreaded presence he must go if commanded to do so, he followed the girl with a beating heart, and in a few minutes stood pale, and almost breathless, before the awful countenance of the great man.</p>
<p n="ENG18400420">Sir Matthew gazed at him for a moment with a sort of sneer, which, if interpreted skilfully, would have been found to address itself inwardly. Sir Matthew could not choose but sneer at the whimsical arrangements of accidents, which had converted him into a Mr. Allworthy. The sneer, however, as far as it concerned himself, had no mixture of contempt in it. "Had another done this thing," thought he, "should I not have called him fool? and is it not ninety-nine chances to a hundred, that thereby I should have described him truly? May the same be said of me? No! By the living God, it may not! How now, little boy? you have made yourself smart, I see — vastly fine, indeed! An inch of clean dowlas, a piece of span-new green baize for a patch, a pair of bony legs without stockings, and magnificent shoes — I did not say a pair, Peggy — but very magnificent shoes; one I suppose won in battle from a giant, and the other from a dwarf . Fine as a prince! isn't he, Peggy?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400421">As he thus jeered the little fellow, his eye wandered with malignant jocularity over his person, which was, in truth, the very model of make-shift poverty; while the child, as if he felt his eye palpably crawl like a reptile over him, shuddered he knew not why.</p>
<p n="ENG18400422">Then, changing his tone so suddenly, as to make even the confiding Peggy start, he continued, "You horrid lump of rags stand back — stand back! back! back! behind that high chair — d'ye hear? Stand close and stand still — if he does not make me as sick as a dog, Peggy, let me never smell musk more!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400423">"He does smell horrid bad to be sure, Sir Matthew!" replied the girl. "Hadn't I better take him back to Molly the kitchen-maid, and make her scour him?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400424">"No, hang him — that won't take it out of him — I know 'em all. No, Peggy, let the scouring alone, and just go up stairs to the nursery-maids, and tell them to send me down a good handsome suit of clothes, complete, of Master Duodecimus's — he is the nearest in size to this scaramouch; and I will dress him, Peggy, as if he were the son of a duke. It will be fun, capital fun, and will it not be generous, Peggy?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400425">"Generous, Sir Matthew? It will be past all belief! What? Him to be dressed up in the clothes of Master Duodecimus? oh, my! Sir Matthew, you must sure-ly be joking."</p>
<p n="ENG18400426">"I'm as serious as an undertaker, girl. Get along with you, and do what I bid you — the longer you're about it, mind, the longer I shall have to sit in the same room with the ragamuflin in his own full dress — so make haste, if you please."</p>
<p n="ENG18400427">This was said in a manner to remove all doubts as to the munificent knight's being in earnest; and the active Peggy went and returned with as little delay as was consistent with the necessity she felt herself under, of entering into some short explanation with the nursery ladies; one and all of whom seemed much inclined, on the first opening of her mission, to treat the whole business as a hoax. When at length, however, she had succeeded in making it apparent that Sir Matthew was waiting for the suit of clothes in a most monstrous outrageous passion of a hurry, the messenger's arms were speedily loaded in exact conformity to the orders she had brought, and she returned to the knight's study with all that was needful to convert the rude exterior of little Michael into the nearest resemblance that nature would permit, to the elegant and accomplished Master Duodecimus.</p>
<p n="ENG18400428">Considering the loathing and disgust manifested by Sir Matthew towards the person and the poverty of his protegé , it was extraordinary to see the amusement he seemed to derive from dressing him up. Though the alert and obedient Peggy stood close by to do his pleasure, it was his own large hands that thrust the little limbs of Michael into the clothing he chose they should wear, and it was amidst shouts of laughter from both, that the ludicrous metamorphosis was completed.</p>
<p n="ENG18400429">But somehow or other when they had finished their masquerading work, the result was not altogether what Sir Matthew anticipated. The clothes were very handsome, well-made clothes, and as poor Michael, notwithstanding his leanness, was a very handsome, wellmade boy, the incongruity between them seemed to vanish in the most unaccountable manner, as the operation drew towards a conclusion.</p>
<p n="ENG18400430">Peggy, however, was not such a fool as not to understand what was expected of her; so when the knight, catching up his son's tasselled cap, pressed it down upon the little curly head as a lusty packer of worthless goods thrusts down the cover that is to enclose them, and then pushed the child towards her with an impulse that nearly brought him upon his nose, she very judiciously renewed her noisy laughter, exclaiming, "Did any one ever see such a little quiz!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400431">"Quiz, girl?" replied Sir Matthew, eyeing him with no very fond expression. "It would be well for the scamp if that was the worst you could say of him — I know a thing or two Peggy, and that boy will be lucky if he gets drowned. I'll bet a hundred guineas that with a few lessons, he would forge any writing you could show him; and before he is twenty, he will have taken as many shapes as Turpin. That boy was born with a halter round his neck, I want no gipsy to tell me that."</p>
<p n="ENG18400432">During the whole of the undressing and redressing operations, the boy's cheeks had been dyed with blushes, and his eyes so fixedly nailed to the floor, that neither Sir Matthew nor his maid had been able to enjoy their embarrassed expression; but as this dark prophecy fell on him, he looked up, and it was well for him that his munificent patron at the same instant turned his mocking glances towards the servant, as he said, "There — gather up his rags, girl, and be sure you wash well after it;" for, had he met that speaking young eye, he could hardly have misunderstood the scorn that shot from it. As it was, however, he saw nothing but the patched garments that were scattered round, and once more sneering as he looked at them, he added, "Lead the little blackguard through the servants'-hall, and into Mrs. Thompson's parlour — d'ye hear, Peggy, up to her very nose, and tell her that I have sent him to pay her a visit, and when she has had enough of the compliment, lead him round to Mademoiselle's room, and we'll have a little fun among the children."</p>
<p n="ENG18400433">By no means displeased with an errand which permitted her to affront with impunity the autocrat of all the offices, Peggy gathered together Michael's discarded wardrobe and then clutching hold of his hand, led him, bon gré mal gré , to the presence of the imperious housekeeper.</p>
<p n="ENG18400434">Mrs. Willis, my Lady Dowling's own maid, and Mr. Jennings, my Lady Dowling's own man, were enjoying with that important functionary a slight morning repast of fruit, cakes, and wine, and at the moment Peggy and her charge entered, they were enjoying some very excellent jokes together. But, Mr. Jennings no sooner cast his eyes on the little factory-boy, than he arose, looking rather abashed at being caught by a drawing-room guest of even nine years old, with a glass of claret in one hand, and a slice of pineapple in the other.</p>
<p n="ENG18400435">Peggy, to whom the conciliatory smiles of this gay gentleman did not descend, enjoyed his mystification exceedingly; and relaxing her rough hold of Michael's wrist, she led him respectfully towards the table saying, "My master has sent this young gentleman to pay you a visit, Mrs. Thompson; perhaps he would like a little fruit. There, my dear, that's the housekeeper Sir Matthew told you of, and if you will please to go and sit down by her, I dare say she will give you something nice."</p>
<p n="ENG18400436">Mr. Jennings immediately placed a chair beside the gracious Mrs. Thompson, who, after filling and setting before the young gentleman a plate with whatever she supposed would be most agreeable, said in a half whisper to his conductor, "Who is it, Peggy? I didn't hear never a carriage."</p>
<p n="ENG18400437">Before she could, or at least before she would answer, Michael, who had not accepted the chair offered to him, took his cap from his head, and with considerably more courage than he had yet shown said, "I am Michael Armstrong, the factory-boy."</p>
<p n="ENG18400438">"Who! What?" screamed the housekeeper; "what bold joke is this, Mrs. Peggy Perkins? Do you think you have got a patent for your place, that you dare play such tricks as this?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400439">"if I keeps my place, I don't think I shall have to thank you for it, ma'am," replied the favoured housemaid, with very little civility. "My master ordered me to bring the boy to pay you a visit; those was his very words, Mrs. Thompson, and as I was bid, so I have done."</p>
<p n="ENG18400440">"There's some people as will do every thing and any thing they are bid," observed Mrs. Willis, again drawing out her favourite smelling-bottle, while with the other hand she extended a wine-glass to Mr. Jennings, for a little Madeira, which she felt was absolutely necessary to support her in this very disagreeable emergency. "Master, or no master, Sir Matthew Dowling doesn't know how to behave himself — it's I says it, and I don't care who repeats it to him."</p>
<p n="ENG18400441">Mr. Jennings started at the factory-boy for a full minute very attentively, and then gave a long low whistle, at the same time turning his eyes with a look of much intelligence full in the face of the housekeeper.</p>
<p n="ENG18400442">"He isn't at all like any of 'em, Mrs. Thompson," said he.</p>
<p n="ENG18400443">Mrs. Thompson shook her head. "There is nothing at all in that, Mr. Jennings, I'm sorry to say. But remember I do desire, and insist, that the subject is never alluded to in my presence again. When I lived with his grace, I always made it a rule that none of the household should ever discourse in my presence of any thing that it was not decent to hear."</p>
<p n="ENG18400444">"Well, ma'am," said Peggy; "when you have done looking at him, he is to go into Momsell's room for the children to see him."</p>
<p n="ENG18400445">The housekeeper, the lady's-maid, and the footman, all simultaneously lifted up their hands and eyes to heaven.</p>
<p n="ENG18400446">"Please to let me put on my old clothes and go home," said Michael.</p>
<p n="ENG18400447">"You little ungrateful wretch!" exclaimed Peggy; "when Sir Matthew dressed you up himself with his own hands. What d'ye mean by that, you bad boy?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400448">"They'll laugh at me," said Michael, resolutely; "and I don't like it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400449">"You don't? Isn't that a good one?" said Mr. Jennings, clapping his hands in ecstasy. "Oh, Lord! pray let us have him back again, Mrs. Peggy, that is to say if Sir Matthew can bear to part with him. He's the finest fun I've got sight of this many a day."</p>
<p n="ENG18400450">"You must find fun for yourself, Mr. Jennings, for I shan't be at the trouble of bringing you none," replied the self-satisfied Peggy, again seizing the hand of Michael, and leading him off.</p>
<p n="ENG18400451">"Well, for a broom-maid, I hope she's saucy enough," said Mr. Jennings; but the subject of his remark was already beyond hearing, threading her way through the long stone passages which conducted to the opposite wing of the mansion, the whole of which was appropriated to the younger branches of the Dowling family.</p>
<p n="ENG18400452">MICHAEL'S INTRODUCTION TO ALL THE MISS DOWLINGS — SIR MATTHEW FEEDS HIM WITH HIS OWN HAND, AND PRESENTS HIM TO ALL HIS MOST FRIENDS.</p>
<p n="ENG18400453">Having given a sharp rap on the door, Peggy was told to "comeen," by the voice of Mademoiselle Beaujoie; whereupon she threw the door wide open before her, and stood with Michael Armstrong in her hand, in the presence of three grown-up Miss Dowlings, and three middle-sized Miss Dowlings, two little Miss Dowlings, and their French governess.</p>
<p n="ENG18400454">The five youngest, all rushed as by one accord towards Michael. "What a pretty little boy!" was exclaimed by two or three of them. "Are you come to play with us? Mayn't we have a holiday, Ma'mselle?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400455">"What an elegant-looking creature!" exclaimed the eldest Miss Dowling, who with her two grown-up sisters, had come into the room for the advantage of practising duets on a venerable pianoforte totally out of tune, and whose loudest note could by no means compete with the shrill accents of the animated group who inhabited the apartment. "Did you ever see a prettier boy, Harriet?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400456">"Who is he, I wonder?" replied the young lady she addressed.</p>
<p n="ENG18400457">"How he blushes!" said the governess, tittering.</p>
<p n="ENG18400458">"What's your name, dear?" demanded Miss Martha, the third daughter of the Dowling race.</p>
<p n="ENG18400459">"Michael Armstrong, ma'am," replied the boy, looking up with an air of surprise, for Miss Martha, queer-looking as she was, spoke kindly. And queer-looking as she was, Michael met her eye with pleasure, for that too spoke kindly, though it was neihter large nor bright.</p>
<p n="ENG18400460">Martha Dowling was in truth, about as ugly as it was possible for a girl of seventeen to be, who was neither deformed nor marked by the smallpox, — short, fat, snub-nosed, red-faced, with a quantity of sandy hair, that, if not red, looked very much as if it intended to be so; eyes of a light, very light gray, and without any thing whatever in external appearance to recommend her, except a smooth, plump, neck and shoulders, with hands and arms to match, which, in truth, were very fair and nice-looking, and a set of well-formed, stout white teeth.</p>
<p n="ENG18400461">What made the unlucky appearance of this young lady the more remarkable, was the contrast it presented to the rest of her family. All the other young people were, like both their parents, "more than common tall," for their respective ages, and, like most other tall young people, rather thin, so that Lady Dowling was apt to indulge herself by declaring that, "though certainly some of her children might be considered prettier than the rest, there was not one of the whole set (except that poor vulgar Martha), who was not most particular genteel-looking."</p>
<p n="ENG18400462">" Genteel looking " she certainly was not, nor graceful, nor beautiful in any way: and the consequence was, that father, mother, brothers, and sisters, were all most heartily ashamed of her. This was a misfortune, and she felt it to be so pretty sharply, for poor vulgar Martha was far from being a stupid girl. But, in her case, as in a million of others, it might be seen that adversity, though "Like the toad, ugly and venomous, Weareth a precious jewel in its head." for of all her race she was the only one whose heart was not seared and hardened by the ceaseless operation of opulent self-indulgence. She felt that she was rather an object of pity than of admiration, of contempt than of envy, of dislike than of love. This is severe schooling for a young girl's heart, but if it produce not reckless indifference, or callous insensibility, it often purifies, softens, and even elevates the character. Such were its effects on Martha Dowling: that coarse-seeming exterior contained the only spark of refinement of which the Dowling family could boast. Never did a high-born Hidalgo, in Spain's proudest days, inculcate among his race the immeasurable importance of pure descent, with more ceaseless or more sedulous earnestness, than did Sir Matthew, the omnipotence of wealth among his. Every child was taught, as soon as its mind became capable of receiving the important truth, that not only was it agreeable to enjoy and cherish all the good things which wealth can procure, but that it was their bounden and special duty to make it visible before the eyes of all men that they could, and that they did, have more money spent upon them, than any other family in the whole country; but Martha felt that all this could not apply to her.</p>
<p n="ENG18400463">Strange to say, the only tie resembling affection which prevented the total isolation of this poor girl among her family, was that which existed between her hard-natured father and herself; but it was a sentiment not easy to analyze. In Sir Matthew it probably arose at first from his having been told that the little girl was very like him; and, on hers, from his being the only person in the house who had ever bestowed a caress upon her. In both cases, cause and effect went on increasing. Martha's face (saving its expression), was incontrovertibly like her father's; and, for that reason, or from the habit it had at first created, her father, though rather ashamed to confess it, was certainly very fond of her.</p>
<p n="ENG18400464">That, as a child, she should love him in return, was almost inevitable; but that, as she advanced in years, she should feel for the being, the most completely formed by nature to be hateful to her, an affection the most unchanging and devoted, had something of mystery in it less easy to be explained. Yet, so it was. Martha Dowling adored her hard-hearted, vicious, unprincipled, illiterate, vulgar father, as heartily as if he had been the model of every thing she most admired and approved. Nay, it may be, that she loved him better, or, at any rate, more strongly still; for it was rather with fanaticism than devotion, or like the pitying fondness with which a mother dotes on a deformed child, who sees only that because it is less loveable it has more need of love than the rest.</p>
<p n="ENG18400465">It was not, however, on the same principle, that Sir Matthew's affection for his ugly daughter increased as years rolled on; for he saw, that though as a child she had been like him, she was now grown very plain: and, in company, he felt almost as much ashamed of her, as Lady Dowling herself. But he could not mistake her love and true affection, nor resist the charm of feeling that at least there was one being in existence, who would have cherished him, even if he had not been the great man he was.</p>
<p n="ENG18400466">In private he scrupled not to yield to this feeling, and certainly derived considerable pleasure from it; but before witnesses, he always joined in the family tone respecting " poor Martha ," and scrupled not to push her on one side, upon all occasions on which any display of Dowling elegance was contemplated.</p>
<p n="ENG18400467">It was this ugly Martha Dowling who now startled little Michael with her voice of kindness, and, notwithstanding all her lady mother said about the "horrid vulgarity of her manners," poor Martha had a sweet and gentle voice. The child looked up at her, and with the weakness that appeared constitutionally peculiar to him, his eyes were immediately filled with tears. Yet Michael was not a whimpering boy either; many had seen him harshly treated, for he had worked almost from babyhood in the cotton-factory, but nobody had ever seen him cry under it. But if his mother, or his poor sickly brother, touched his little heart, either with joy or tenderness, he would weep and laugh both, with very infantine susceptibility. So it was with him now, for when Martha added with a good-humoured smile, "And what brings you here, Master Armstrong?" he laughed outright as he replied, "Indeed, ma'am, I ain't Master Armstrong, and I don't know a bit what I be here for."</p>
<p n="ENG18400468">This speech, though addressed to Martha, being heard by all, the contrast between his appearance and his language considerably excited the curiosity of the two eldest Miss Dowlings.</p>
<p n="ENG18400469">"La! how he talks! I thought he was a gentleman by his jacket, didn't you, Arabella?" said Miss Harriet.</p>
<p n="ENG18400470">"Yes to be sure I did," replied the eldest sister. "But I am sure he is not , with that horrid way of speaking, what did you bring him here for Peggy?" continued the young lady with an air of authority.</p>
<p n="ENG18400471">"Because master bid me, miss," was the satisfactory reply.</p>
<p n="ENG18400472">"Well to be sure, that is queer! I suppose he's the son of somebody or other, or papa would never have sent him in to us. It is not at all his way to patronise vulgarity. Where do you live, young gentleman?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400473">Michael looked very much as if he were in danger of laughing again, but he did not, and replied very demurely, "in Mr. Sykes's back-kitchen, ma'am, in Hoxley-lane."</p>
<p n="ENG18400474">Though the answer was addressed to the inquirer, his eye turned to Martha as he uttered it, as if anxious to see how she bore it, but he encountered a look that altogether puzzled him; for though it was at least as kind as before, there was uneasiness in it, and she looked round her, as if uncomfortably doubtful of what would happen next.</p>
<p n="ENG18400475">She did not, however, wait long for the result; for Miss Sophia, Miss Louisa, and Miss Charlotte, the three middling-sized Miss Dowlings, who had approached very near to the little boy, and were even growing so familiar that Miss Charlotte had taken hold of one of his dark curls, were severally and suddenly drawn off by the respective hands of their two eldest sisters, and the governess.</p>
<p n="ENG18400476">"Then he is not a young gentleman after all?" said Miss Sophia.</p>
<p n="ENG18400477">"La; how funny!" exclaimed Miss Louisa, "where did he get his clothes from?" interrogated Miss Harriet.</p>
<p n="ENG18400478">"Most likely he stole them," responded Miss Arabella.</p>
<p n="ENG18400479">"Why 'tis Duodecimus's jacket!" ejaculated the observing Miss Charlotte.</p>
<p n="ENG18400480">"Oh! quelle horreur!" cried the governess driving her pupils all before her to the other end of the room.</p>
<p n="ENG18400481">At this moment, and before any more active measures could be resorted to for the safety of the young ladies, the door of the school-room was again thrown open, and the portly person of Sir Matthew appeared at it, accompanied by the globe-like figure of Doctor Crockley.</p>
<p n="ENG18400482">"Good morning young ladies!" said the proud father, looking round him, and immediately entering into the jest that he saw was afloat. "How do you like the young beau I have sent you?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400483">"Good gracious, papa!" exclaimed the elegant and much admired Miss Arabella, "he is a beggar-boy and a thief!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400484">Sir Matthew, and his friend Doctor Crockley, both burst into such a shout of laughter at this sally, that it was a minute before either of them could speak; but at length the knight, turning to the doctor, said,</p>
<p n="ENG18400485">"Leave my girls alone, Crockley, for finding out what's what; I don't believe there's one of them but what would have found that fellow out, if I had wrapped him up in the king's own mantle."</p>
<p n="ENG18400486">"They are sharp enough, there is no doubt of that," replied his friend, "but I must say you don't perform your charitable acts by halves, Sir Matthew. You have dressed up the little scamp so superbly, that nothing but the vulgar dark complexion could make one know that he was not one of your own."</p>
<p n="ENG18400487">"Why yes, there is some difference in the skins I must say," replied Sir Matthew, looking with most parental complacency on the fair skins, flaxen hair, and light eyelashes of his race.</p>
<p n="ENG18400488">Difference, indeed! 'Tis Africa and Europe. And is it not remarkable Sir Matthew to see the look of him? Hasn't he got a sort of slavish, terrified air with it? I tell you what, Sir Matthew, I should not be at all surprised to find, when the march of philosophy has got a little farther, that the blackamoor look comes along with the condition, and, that the influence of wealth and consequence is as quickly shown upon the external appearance of men, women, and children, as a field of clover upon the inferior animals. And why not? It is quite natural — perfectly conformable to the analogy, that, by accurately tracing cause and effect, may be followed through all creation. You have a head, Sir Matthew, for that sort of thing: you can understand me, if nobody else can."</p>
<p n="ENG18400489">The little doctor knew that this was one of the soft points at which his wealthy neighbour was assailable. Sir Matthew loved to be assured that his head was of a superior fabric.</p>
<p n="ENG18400490">"But why, papa, should you send a nasty beggar-boy to us, with Duo's clothes on?" inquired the intelligent Louisa. Before he replied to this, the knight exchanged a glance with his friend, which seemed to say, "that's the right sort — she's in the clover-field."</p>
<p n="ENG18400491">"I have taken him in for charity, my dear," replied the knight, with a sort of pomposity that seemed of a new pattern. The young ladies had never seen papa look so before. Martha, from having found herself rather more frequently the object of Dr. Crockley's jokes than she desired, had, on his entering the room, retired to the window, but now she came up to her father, and quietly, and as often happened, almost unnoticed, kissed his hand.</p>
<p n="ENG18400492">For charity!" exclaimed the fair-haired Arabella, moving a step or two farther away from the object of this extraordinary caprice. "La Papa! why don't you send him to the hospital?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400493">Doctor Crockley laughed outrageously. "That girl, Sir Matthew," he said, when he had recovered his voice, "that girl is beyond all comparison the most thoroughly-born lady that ever I happened to hit upon — and that is saying something, I promise you. She hasn't a commonplace vulgar notion in her from top to toe. It is what I call the physiology of wealth — it is upon my soul — it is a study, a science. I have not got to the end of it, but I am certain I shall make a system out of it — and you'll be able to follow me, there's some comfort in that. I declare to God, that if I had not found you in the neighbourhood, I should have bolted. I cannot exist without occasionally bringing my mind in contact with superior intellect; you find that, too, Sir Matthew, I'm sure you do."</p>
<p n="ENG18400494">Sir Matthew assured him that he did, very much; and then pulling a Belinda lock that adorned the olive-coloured throat of Mademoiselle Beaujoie, he asked her if she had ever seen a brat, taken in for charity, so nicely dressed as that little blackguard."</p>
<p n="ENG18400495">"Brawt? ça veut dire petit vaut-rien. No, my honor Sire Matue, nayver! you are viddout no reval de most — "</p>
<p n="ENG18400496">Whilst the French governess struggled to find a word sufficiently expressive of admiration, and if possible, with some little meaning besides, Sir Matthew took the liberty of pinching her ear, while he whispered into it, "What, you little rogue? what?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400497">She gave him a Parisian æillade , by no means an unkind one, and turned away, while the two smallest Miss Dowlings ran up to her, and, in the jargon in which their mamma and papa delighted, demanded "si papa voulait let them jouer avec the little beggar-boy?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400498">This question, repeated nearly in the same words by Mademoiselle Beaujoie to the knight, appeared to cause him some perplexity, and, after reflecting upon it for a minute, he turned to consult his philosophical friend.</p>
<p n="ENG18400499">"I say Crockley, what do you think of that?" Then lowering his voice, he added, "you comprehend the job, doctor, — which will do best to help it? Parlour or kitchen, school-room or factory, drawing-room or scullery?</p>
<p n="ENG18400500">"All and every of them," replied his friend, in the same low tone, but very decisively. "No doubt in nature about that, Sir Matthew; he must be here, there, and every where, and the thing will fly like mad."</p>
<p n="ENG18400501">"You are always right Crockley, there is nobody like you," replied the grateful knight, cordially slapping the round shoulders of his friend, "I twig, I twig, and so it shall be, by the Lord Harry."</p>
<p n="ENG18400502">"You are as rapid as lightning, Sir Matthew! I remember no instance of a cerebral formation so absolutely perfect as yours. Now then, let us visit my lady, shall we? I am as dry as brickdust, and it is about lunch-time I take it. Bring the boy with you, and introduce him before the servants in style."</p>
<p n="ENG18400503">"So I will — that's it — I twig, Crockley. Go, Martha, and see if the luncheon is laid."</p>
<p n="ENG18400504">The report being favorable to the wishes of the gentleman, the party, consisting of the three eldest Miss Dowlings, their papa and the doctor, left the young ladies and their governess to dine, while, with little Michael, who was ordered to follow, they all repaired to the dinning-room, where a well-covered table awaited them.</p>
<p n="ENG18400505">Her ladyship and Mr. Augustus were already there, and both expressed exactly the degree of curiosity which the knight desired, as to who the little gentleman might be whom they brought with them.</p>
<p n="ENG18400506">Miss Dowling; and Miss Harriet Dowling, burst into a loud laugh; Sir Matthew looked towards the sideboard, and seeing two servants in attendance there, spoke as follows:</p>
<p n="ENG18400507">"My dear Lady Dowling, I must bespeak your munificent charity, and universal benevolence in favour of this little unhappy boy. His mother is a widow, and — and something, I forget exactly what, is very unhappy about her — and this little boy behaved remarkably well — " Here Sir Matthew broke off in some degree of embrrassment, not wishing particularly to impress upon his lady's mind that it was his tender care for the Lady Clarissa, Shrimpton, which had first introduced the fortunate factory-boy to his notice. But he passed all that over very skilfully, and ended his harangue by saying, "I know perfectly well, my dear lady Dowling, that there is not in the whole world so amiable a person as yourself, and therefore I entertain not the slightest doubt, that the benevolence which warms my heart on this occasion, will communicate itself to yours."</p>
<p n="ENG18400508">Lady Dowling raised her light eyebrows, and her still lighter eyelashes, into a look of the most unmitigated astonishment, and remained thus for a while, contemplating the extraordinary spectacle, of one of the handsomest boys she had ever seen, dressed in a style of unquestionable fashion, and presented to her as a being so deplorably miserable, as to have excited the pity of her husband. The first clear and distinct idea that suggested itself was, the necessity of inquiring respecting this beautiful child's mother, and of finding out whether she might not happen to be beautiful too; the next arose from the sudden recognition of her own son's own clothes, and the complexion of the lady became extremely florid."</p>
<p n="ENG18400509">"I should like to know where he got those clothes from," she said in accents that by no means spoke composure of spirit.</p>
<p n="ENG18400510">"My dearest love," replied the most amiable and the most polite of husbands, "that is entirely my doing. You have known me long enough, my sweetest, to be aware that I never do any thing by halves — I saw that little fellow ragged and wretched, and I clothed him!"</p>
<p n="ENG18400511">"Well, I must say, I do think — " began her ladyship, when Sir Matthew, seating himself at the table, thrust a knife and fork into the very centre of a pigeon-pie, and accompanied the act by a sound, something between a slight cough and a grunt, which, in language matrimonial, was known to mean, "You had better hold your tongue and mind your business." Whereupon, Lady Dowling sat down too, but her fair complexion was rather more rosy than was becoming, and it was in no very sweet voice that she said to Martha, who ventured to take a chair next her, "Do get a little farther, child can't you? — You know I hate to be crushed and crammed up so."</p>
<p n="ENG18400512">Here Dr. Crockley, who had already fallen with vehemence upon a cold ham, stopped for a moment, and laughed vehemently. "My dear madam, you are of the slight and elegant order yourself, and you don't make allowance for poor people who are as fat and roundabout as Miss Martha and I — we can't squeeze ourselves into an eggshell, Miss Martha, can we?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400513">Her slim sisters tittered, and the witty Augustus observed, that "To be sure, Martha did look more like a collar of Oxford brawn, than any thing else in creation."</p>
<p n="ENG18400514">Meanwhile, the meal proceeded, and little Michael, continued to stand half-way between the door and the table, as fixedly as if he had taken root there.</p>
<p n="ENG18400515">Martha was, in general, very philosophically inclined to let all things round her take their course; but she sat exactly opposite to the object of her father's benevolence, and there was something in the expression of his eye, as it rested upon the dainties before him, that was more than she could bear. "May I give the little boy something to eat, papa?" said she addressing her father in a timid voice.</p>
<p n="ENG18400516">"How shall we manage about that, Crockley?" whispered Sir Matthew into the ear of the doctor who sat close to him.</p>
<p n="ENG18400517">"Cram him, cram him, Sir Matthew. — You'll find it like oil on the surface of water, spreading far and wide," replied his counsellor, whispering in return, "Let the boy have to boast of his high feeding, and it will do more good than if you were to endow him with lands and houses, and keep him lean."</p>
<p n="ENG18400518">"Say you so, my wise man! Faith, then, the matter is easy enough, for I believe Dowling Lodge is rather celebrated for its superfluity of good cheer. We'll have him gasping with indigestion within a week, see if we don't." Then raising his voice, he answered the petition of Martha, by repeating her words, "May you give the little boy something to eat?" and then added with a laugh, "By all manner of means, Miss Martha; and," taking some halfdemolished fragments off his own plate, "he may boast of feeding as well as his master. Here, Master Factory, catch!" And so saying, the benevolent owner of Dowlig Lodge skilfully cut the air with half a pigeon, which, taking exactly the direction he intended, struck Michael in the middle of his forehead. Whatever might be the effect of this liberality of heart and hand out of doors, Sir Matthew had every reason to be satisfied with the result within.</p>
<p n="ENG18400519">The whole Dowling family, with the exception of stupid Martha, burst into a simultaneous shout of delight, while Dr. Crockley clapped his hands, and vociferated, "Bravo!" as loud as he could scream.</p>
<p n="ENG18400520">Just at this moment, the great bell at the front door, and it was a very great bell, resounded along passage and halls with prodigious clamour. This is a sound which produces, in those who hear it, emotions varying according to their varying temperaments. Genuinely fine, poco curante people, if they hear it, heed it not. Fussy folks, of whatever rank or station, prepare their looks and their books, themselves and their belongings, to receive the threatened visitation advantageously; but in a mansion of such professional display as Dowling Lodge, a ring at the door-bell is an event of serious importance. In such an establishment, the luxuries, or even the comforts of the family, are confessedly of no importance at all, when placed in competition with the display of their grandeur; and upon the present occasion, the whole family hastened to leave their unfinished repast, in order to receive the welcome spectator of their fine clothes and fine furniture in the drawing-room.</p>
<p n="ENG18400521">"My Lady Dowling, and her two light-coloured elder daughters, Sir Matthew, his eldest son, and his learned friend, succeeded in reaching their respective sofas and bergères half a minute before the door was thrown open, and Lady Clarissa Shrimpton, Miss Brotherton, Miss Mogg, and Mr. Osmond Norval were announced.</p>
<p n="ENG18400522">Great, of course, and very zealous was the joy expressed by the Dowling family at the sight of their illustrious friend and her cortège . Miss Brotherton was, indeed of herself, or rather of her purse, a personage pretty sure of being well received every where; but even Miss Mogg was (in yankee phrase) well shaken, and Mr. Osmond Norval gazed at by the young ladies, as an emanation from the rays that encircle the brow of Apollo; while even the exquisite Augustus ventured, in compliment to his titled patroness, to shake him too, though he had never been introduced to him at Oxford.</p>
<p n="ENG18400523">But the feelings of Sir Matthew, at this prompt reappearance of his fair and noble friend, were something vastly different from any thing his family could participate in, nor did Lady Clarissa mistake them. There was a look that spoke infinitely more than any tongue could utter, and a meaning in the silent pressure of the hand, confirming the idea, which had often recurred to her during the night, that it would soon be necessary to make Sir Matthew understand the exact nature and extent of the flattering, but perfectly innocent preference she was conscious of feeling for him.</p>
<p n="ENG18400524">This first delightful, but somewhat agitating moment over, Lady Clarissa hastened to explain the purpose of her visit.</p>
<p n="ENG18400525">"You guess why I am come, do you not, Sir Matthew?" she said, pointing to Mr. Osmond Norval. "Permit me to present to you, and your highly-educated family, this young votary of the muses, who, if my judgment errs not, may fairly claim competition with the first poets of the age. Nor should we, of this remote neighbourhood, be insensible to the honour of being the first to assist in pluming the yet unfledged wing, which shall one day bear him aloft into the empyrean regions of eternal fame."</p>
<p n="ENG18400526">Nothing could be more touching than the manner in which Mr. Osmond Norval pressed his hat between his two hands, and bowed low, low, low, to the noble lady who thus announced him. Sir Matthew, with a stride which, for the vigorous distance it carried him, might have been compared to that of the knave of hearts, approached the young man, and strenuously pressing one of his slender hands in both his own capacious fists, attested the value he attached to her ladyship's introduction by saying, "Mr. Osmond Norval! — I will not deny, that I do occasionally myself offer tribute at the muse' shrine; and that being in some sort a brother of the craft, I most unfeignedly rejoice in making the acquaintance of a gentleman so distinguished in it as yourself. But that is not the feeling, sir, which principally leads me to tell you, that from this time forth, I shall hold you as one of my most esteemed friends — you understand me. That lady, sir," pointing to Lady Clarissa, "is a person whose lightest word ought to be law in this neighbourhood, — and to me, is so. If you publish any works, put Sir Matthew Dowling's name down, sir, for fifty copies; should you find yourself at any time in want of a library, pray remember that there is one of no very small limits at Dowling Lodge; and your reception, sir, in my drawing-room, and at my dinner-table, will ever be such as befits me to bestow on one honoured by the patronage of Lady Clarissa Shrimpton."</p>
<p n="ENG18400527">Before this speech was quite finished, Lady Dowling becoming rather fidgetty, ventured to mutter something about its being far better to sit down to talk; but Miss Brotherton was greatly too much amused by what was passing to hear her; and for Miss Mogg to sit while her patroness stood, was quiet out of the question; so that Lady Dowling, and the too eldest Miss Dowlings, continued to stand like three finely-dressed flaxen-headed statues, to the end of it.</p>
<p n="ENG18400528">Sir Matthew than led the high-born lady to a chair, while Miss Brotherton perceiving that her conversation with the knight was now reduced to a whisper, and that consequently there would be no more fun in listening to it, condescended at last to answer a few of the amiable inquiries after her health, which were addressed to her by Mr. Augustus and his two sisters. Meanwhile, the young Norval, with pensive eye intent on nature's beauties, stole his way to the open window, and there having twice or thrice passed his fingers through his long locks, which descendedlin disordered curls almost to his shoulders, and once and again buttoned and unbuttoned the broad shirt-collar which fell back, unrestrained by that most unintellectual ligature, a cravat, remained partly, it might be, to let the young ladies look at him, and partly to receive the fragrant breeze of summer upon his brow.</p>
<p n="ENG18400529">It was now that Dr. Crockley felt he was called upon to do something that might bring him into notice, and waddling up to the young poet, he addressed him with an air of incipient friendship which seemed to say, "And I too am somebody."</p>
<p n="ENG18400530">"You will find this neighbourhood not very prolific, young gentleman, in such gifts of intellect as a poet requires in order to be duly appreciated. Nevertheless, I will not deny that there is amongst us a knot, a little knot, Mr. Norval, whom, upon further acquaintance, you may find not altogether uncongenial. For myself, I may venture to say, that I am as warmly devoted to every subject, directly or indirectly, connected with the divine, ethereal, immaterial, intellectual part of our composite formation, as it is possible for a man to be, and it will give me pleasure, sir, to make your acquaintance." As this was spoken with energy, the sultry season made itself felt under the exertion, and Dr. Crockley found it necessary so far to remember the viler portion of his composite formation, as to wipe his face and bald head assiduously.</p>
<p n="ENG18400531">The poet bowed, but not as he had bowed to Lady Clarissa.</p>
<p n="ENG18400532">Meanwhile, Lady Dowling, her light-coloured daughters, and Miss Mogg, sat profoundly silent upon two chairs and one sofa of the splendid apartment; Miss Brotherton and Mr. Augustus continued to talk about nothing, and Sir Matthew and Lady Clarissa ceased not to mutter, what none but themselves could hear, upon an ottoman, which stood in front of a distant window. If eyebeams could have interrupted a tête-à-tête , theirs would not have long continued to proceed undisturbed; for the mistress of Dowling Lodge did certainly cast not a few anxious glances towards the master of it; but it was not for that reason that he at length got up and rather hastily left the room.</p>
<p n="ENG18400533">While all this was passing in the drawing-room, Martha Dowling and Michael Armstrong remained alone together in the dining-room.</p>
<p n="ENG18400534">The flying pigeon, impelled by the beneficent Sir Matthew, having hit the forehead of his highly-favoured protegé at the very moment that the larum, announcing Lady Clarissa's arrival made itself heard, the greatly amused company left the room before it was possible to ascertain what would become of it.</p>
<p n="ENG18400535">The child "caught it ere it came to the ground;" but having done so, held it by one leg with an air of very comical indecision, till Dr. Crockley, who respectfully walked the last out of the room, shut the door behind him.</p>
<p n="ENG18400536">The eyes of the factory-boy and the ugly girl then met. "Come to the table, my dear," said Martha; "and if you like that bird, eat it — here is a plate and knife and fork for you; but if you like any thing else better, leave it, and tell me what you will have."</p>
<p n="ENG18400537">Michael opened his magnificent black eyes, and looked earnestly at her. He approached the table, laid down the half-dissected pigeon, but said not a word.</p>
<p n="ENG18400538">"You would like something else better, would you not?" said Martha, smiling at him.</p>
<p n="ENG18400539">"I don't know," answered Michael, returning the smile.</p>
<p n="ENG18400540">"You don't know? — cannot you tell what you should like?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400541">"No ma'am, if you please; I don't know what any of it is."</p>
<p n="ENG18400542">"My dear child, it is all very good, I believe, only you know some people like one thing, and some another. Little boys generally like something very sweet. Here is some cake, what do you say to that?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400543">"I know what I should like best," said Michael.</p>
<p n="ENG18400544">"Do you? — then you shall have it, if you will tell me what it is."</p>
<p n="ENG18400545">"Something good for mother," said the child, blushing violently; "but you must send me, and order me to take it to her, or else it will be stealing it."</p>
<p n="ENG18400546">"Very well, I will send something to her; but you must eat something yourself first. What shall it be, Michael?" This arrangement seemed to put the boy into a state of perfect ecstasy; he clapped his hands, raised one foot, and then the other, with childish glee, and exclaimed in an accent from which all timidity had fled, "Oh! dear, oh! dear, how nice?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400547">"What, the cake? — or the grapes? — or what?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400548">"Taking it to mother! Taking it to mother!" cried Michael.</p>
<p n="ENG18400549">"Then you love mother very much, Michael?" said Martha, drawing the child towards her, and kissing his smooth dark forehead. Michael nodded his head, and nestled closer to her.</p>
<p n="ENG18400550">"Well, then, never mind about the cake at present; but I must find a little basket, must I not? — I will give you a basket if you will take care of it and bring it back to me, because perhaps we may want it again. — There, you may eat that if you are hungry, while I am gone away — I shall be back again in a minute." So saying, she placed some bread and meat before him, and left the room.</p>
<p n="ENG18400551">Michael had by no means lost his appetite by his morning walk to Hoxley-lane, and being in excellent spirits to boot, he sat down and began to devour what had been set before him with very zealous eagerness.</p>
<p n="ENG18400552">He had not, however, done one-half of what he was capable of performing, when another door, opposite to the one by which Martha had made her exit , opened, and Sir Matthew Dowling walked in.</p>
<p n="ENG18400553">Michael's knife and active fingers remained suspended midway between his mouth and the plate; the colour forsook his cheek, and his eye sunk as if unable to meet that of his munificent patron.</p>
<p n="ENG18400554">"What stuffing still, you greedy little rascal? What have you touched with your nasty factory fingers? Not the grapes, I hope?"</p>
<p n="ENG18400555">Michael tried to say "no," but did not succeed in producing the sound; so contented himself by letting the forefinger of his left hand drop into his plate to show how he had been engaged.</p>

<sample><p n="ENG184003002">"My brother tells me that all of us, who are old enough, must seek our own living, for that there is nothing left to support us. Myself especially, he says, must, to use his own words, look about me directly, as my behaviour to my family has never been such as to justify my looking to any of them for assistance. This amounts to my being actually turned out of doors, an exigency which at this moment leaves me no other resource than what is afforded by the enclosed letter. Read it, Michael, and let me know if you are willing to give me your assistance and protection in reaching the amiable writer of it. I could never have accepted, even for a day, the hospitality she so generously offer, could I not prove to her, by bringing you with me, that the sad subject which interrupted our friendship some seven or eight years ago, could never again be a source of pain to either of us.</p>
<p n="ENG184003003">"My dear father's last act towards me, which was, as I think I told you, the placing a few hundred pounds in my hands for the express purpose of my leaving the country, will enable me to undertake this long journey without being a burden upon you, The green pocket-book , Michael, so well known to Mr. Parsons and Lady Clarissa, as the repository of my father's ready money, and so disgracefully struggled for during his last moments, will prove of no value to its possessors beyond its morocco cover and its silken lining; for the notes which he took from it to give to me, were the last he ever placed in it. My messenger has orders to wait for your reply. If it will suit you immediately to accompany me to Nice — my first stage shall be to the little inn at Fairly, which you mentioned to me. I fear you will find me a weak and troublesome traveller; but I think I have been improving in health ever since I learnt that I had not your death to answer for.</p>
<p n="ENG184003004">"Your grateful friend, "Martha Dowling."</p>
<p n="ENG184003005">The other letter was from Miss Brotherton, and ran thus:</p>
<p n="ENG184003006">"Need I tell you, my dearest Martha, with what feelings I received the news of your present painful position? Your father's marriage with Lady Clarissa was, for your sake, a source of great sorrow to me, for I was certain that your domestic happiness would be destroyed by it; and this most unexpected event of your father's bankruptcy makes me feel quite sure that you have no longer a comfortable home in England. Come then to me, my dear Martha! The painful estrangement which grew between us, just when I was beginning to know and value your excellent qualities, has long been a source of very painful regret to me, because I am aware that I judged you unfairly, and pronounced that judgment harshly. Be generous, then, and prove that you can forgive this, by immediately giving me the pleasure of receiving you as my guest. When we are together, we will consult about what will be best for the future; but at any rate I have the satisfaction of knowing that the climate to which I am inviting you is likely to be beneficial to your health during the approaching winter: come to me, then, dear friend, without delay. On the other side you will find the route sketched that I recommend you for your journey. My quarters are roomy enough to accommodate either man or maid-servant, or both, if it will suit you to be so accompanied.</p>
<p n="ENG184003007">"Ever, my dear Martha, "Affectionately yours, " Mary Brotherton ."</p>
<p n="ENG184003008">The consequence of this packet was another metamorphosis on the part of Michael, "She shall not think," said he, addressing Mr. Bell, "that my respect for her is lessened because her fortune has fallen. I will wait upon her with faithful duty and most grateful affection: but she was born in a palace, and I in a cabin; and I will not, especially just now, obtrude myself upon her as a companion. As her servant I hope I may be useful to her, and it is in that capacity that I shall attend her."</p>
<p n="ENG184003009">There was so much good feeling shown in this project, that Mr. Bell could not oppose it, whatever he might think of its necessity; and Michael, therefore, gave the astonished Martha the meeting at the little inn she had named, in the character of a very neat and respectable-looking man-servant. Her faithful Betty Parker, who had consented to be the companion of her journey, was in the room with her when Michael made his appearance at the door, to receive her orders. The cautious manner in which he made her comprehend his purpose, and the nature of the office he had assumed, suggested to her the propriety of not discussing it in the presence of the well-contented Betty, who was exceedingly comforted by discovering that the young man whom her mistress had informed her would travel with them, was to do so as her fellow-servant, as she by no means felt herself capable of becoming "servant of all work" to a young lady travelling through foreign countries, of which she had never even heard the names. But having contrived to dismiss her female attendant on an errand, Martha began to remonstrate with her faithful squire upon the great mistake he had made in fancying that she had ever thought of travelling with him in any other capacity than that of a friend. All she said, however, was in vain. Michael, though in a manner the most humbly respectful, persisted in his purpose; and the almost destitute girl was therefore constrained to set off upon her travels in a style which she felt to be very unfitting to her situation. Her conscience, however, could not reproach her for this, for most assuredly she could not help it.</p>
<p n="ENG184003010">Many were the letters, and various the mementos of affection, intrusted by Mr. and Mrs. Bell to the care of Michael for their dearly-beloved Mary Brotherton. Nor was there an individual of whose welfare he thought it would please her to hear, whom he did not visit to receive their loving blessings for the benefactress who, notwithstanding her wide wanderings, had never failed to remember the wants of all who had faithfully served her, or in any way become dependent on her bounty.</p>
<p n="ENG184003011">These duties completed, and a farewell of most grateful affection uttered to the amiable clergyman and his excellent wife, Michael set off upon his long journey with feelings of hope, joy, confidence, fear, diffidence, and trembling affection, — all so strongly mixed together in his bosom that, had his life depended on it, he could not himself have told which it was that most frequently preponderated. Yet, altogether, his state of mind was very delightful: the novelty and excitement of journeying, so pregnant of enjoyment to most of us, was most especially captivating to him, whose education had been little more than the unchecked development of imagination, and of that keen observation of all surrounding objects which his shepherd life had taught him.</p>
<p n="ENG184003012">The first painful interruption to the state of felicity, arose from his finding himself under the necessity of confessing to Martha that he had no more money wherewith to pay their way. Aware that in the performance of his self-appointed office Michael would have to pay every thing, and keep a regular account of it; and aware also that the money he had received from her would enable him to do this, without giving him the additional trouble of daily settlements with her, she had merely said, a minute or two before they set off, "You will be kind enough to be my banker, Michael, during the journey, and we will settle accounts at the end of it."</p>
<p n="ENG184003013">For just one week from the day of their leaving Fairly, he was able to do this; but then the little remnant of his treasure failed him, and great as was his repugnance to the measure, he was compelled by dire necessity to confess that nearly the whole of her generous gift had gone to — "to satisfy the rapacity of Mr. Parsons."</p>
<p n="ENG184003014">It would be hardly possible for one human being to be more grateful to another than poor Martha felt to her young attendant after this disclosure. She remembered the agony which he had made to cease; she remembered, too, her state of utter incapacity even to comprehend, and still less to avert the horrors that surrounded her; and, spite of all Michael's respectful efforts to induce her to perform her allotted character properly, she never from the hour of this disclosure treated him otherwise than as a dear and valued friend.</p>
<p n="ENG184003015">As their journey approached its termination, however (to which period Michael had looked with peculiar anxiety, as that most important to the dignity of Martha), there was one argument, and one only, by which he was able to coax her into letting him make his first appearance before Miss Brotherton in the character of her servant; and this was his very natural wish to ascertain whether Edward and Fanny would recognise him.</p>
<p n="ENG184003016">It was therefore still in the dress, and with the demeanour of a servant, that the poor factory-boy, now become a tall and very handsome young man, armed himself with courage to enter the presence of his brother, and once more to draw near to the dear and gentle little being whom he had so fondly loved during the miserable period they had passed together at the Deep Valley. It had been previously agreed between himself and Martha, that when she sent for him, it should be for the purpose of giving him some long and particular instructions respecting the luggage he was to get from the custom-house, in order to give him time to look, and be looked at, before the moment of discovery should arrive.</p>
<p n="ENG184003017">The young man trembled like an aspen-leaf as he laid his hand upon the lock of the door, the opening of which would bring him face to face with his brother. And perchance he might have indulged in a longer interval of preparation, had not the voice of Martha distinctly pronounced the words "Come in!" Further delay was out of the question; he pushed forward the door, and entered.</p>
<p n="ENG184003018">The first figure that his eyes fell upon was that of a young lady — small, and of very delicate proportions — whose head, which was hanging over some employment as the door opened, was raised as he entered, displaying to him a very lovely face, and a pair of eyes whose dark brilliance almost made the beholder wink. Could that be Fanny Fletcher? No. Yet that it should be Miss Brotherton seemed more impossible still. Like all young people who have been separated from some one considerably older than themselves, ever since the period when this difference made one of them appear fully grown, while the other was still a child, Michael fancied that in Miss Brotherton he should see an elderly person, no more like a pretty girl, than he was himself. But Mary Brotherton had not fully completed her twenty-ninth year; and happening, moreover, to be very peculiarly young-looking both in face and figure, it was not very wonderful that he should doubt of her identity; for it was in truth Mary Brotherton, and no other, whose bright and laughing loveliness made him turn his admiring eyes away, in search of something dearer, though not more beautiful.</p>
<p n="ENG184003019">At the end of the sofa-table, at which Miss Brotherton sat with Martha Dowling beside her, was a young female figure which presented only a profile to his gaze — But that was enough — the delicate oval face, the sweet regular small features, the glossy light brown hair parted Madonna-like upon the ivory brow, and the long eyelash that seemed to rest upon her cheek as she read, all proclaimed that he looked upon the same gentle lovely creature whose soft voice had whispered "patience!" when his spirit, but for her, had died within him. At the sight of this sweet vision, that in shadowy and uncertain outline had so often visited his reveries, Michael's manhood almost forsook him, and large tears gathered in his eyes, which he was fain to hide by turning round again and performing some blundering operation with the lock of the door. Martha played her part admirably, appearing to be the most exceedingly particular young lady, about boxes, bags, and desks, that ever travelled.</p>
<p n="ENG184003020">"Remember, I beg," she said, "that you see yourself to the opening of every package. Don't let them touch a single article that you do not watch the whole time; and be sure that every thing is locked again — and on no account forget the covers, or mismatch them — and remember particularly — " et cætera, et cætera , and so she ran on at the imminent risk of being classed by her clever friend Mary as the veriest fidget that ever arrived to bore a peaceable household and all in order to give her poor companion time to recover himself, and see distinctly what was before him.</p>
<p n="ENG184003021">But Michael could not recover himself, nor could he even find courage to look about him. It was a large saloon that Miss Brotherton occupied, and the agitated young man rather felt that there was a gentleman occupied with books and papers at a distant table, than saw him. Yet to see him he was determined, if his life were to be the forfeit; and turning his head with an eye as troubled as that of Hamlet, when tremblingly following his father's spirit, he stood at last with clasped hands, protruded head, and features almost convulsed with emotion, when he had an uninterrupted view of his brother's clam and beautiful countenance.</p>
<p n="ENG184003022">Edward was very busily employed, and unconsciously submitted himself to this examination without raising his eyes, or moving in any way; but Miss Brotherton's ear caught something like a sob from the silent object of all Martha's eloquence, and suddenly looking up perceived Michael in the attitude described, but stealthily, and perhaps unknowingly approaching Edward's table, while the tears he could no longer check, rolled down his manly cheek.</p>
<p n="ENG184003023">There are some individuals of the human family gifted with such quickness of perception, and rapidity of inference, that their faculties act with the certainty of instinct, and the brilliancy of inspiration. Miss Brotherton was one of those; and after looking for a minute or two at Michael, quite as earnestly as Michael looked at Edward, she sprung from the sofa, pushed the table that stood before it with such violence from her as nearly to overset it, and rushing forward laid her hand upon his arm, exclaiming, "For mercy's sake tell me young man, who you are, and where you come from?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003024">On hearing these words in a voice unusually loud and agitated, Edward rose hastily from his seat, and approached Miss Brotherton as if to protect her from some threatened danger; but turning towards him, she held up her hand as if to prevent his hostile approach, and said, "Stay Edward, stay! Look at him! Good Heaven! Look at him, dearest Edward, and tell me who he is like!"</p>
<p n="ENG184003025">Thus addressed, Edward did look at his brother, and for a moment with a countenance that seemed to say Miss Brotherton had lost her wits — but suddenly Michael smiled at him as he caught his puzzled eye, and then he started, and almost gasped for breath — and his distracted eyes fixed themselves on the agitated face before him as if they would read in it the history of years.</p>
<p n="ENG184003026">"Edward! — Teddy!" cried Michael, opening his arms, and making a step in advance.</p>
<p n="ENG184003027">In the next instant the brothers were locked in each other's arms, and Miss Brotherton drew back, and gazed upon them from a distance as if the very ground that sustained hearts under the influence of such feelings was holy — while Fanny Fletcher, rose and sat down, and rose again, checking the feeling that would have sent her to stretch forth a hand of welcome to her old friend, by telling herself that no hand, no voice but Edward's could be cared for then. And perhaps she was right; for it is certain that for several minutes, neither Edward nor Michael were fully conscious where they were, nor who they might be that were near them. Once and again each beating heart was strained against the brother heart, and then, their right hands clasped, and the left placed, each on the other's shoulder, "They fell to such perusal of the face," that now, after eight cruel years of absence, was once more beaming with love and sympathy before their eyes, that it must have been a very heartless and soulless being who should have come between them.</p>
<p n="ENG184003028">Though such a history as Michael's might well have occupied more than one long summer's day in the telling, to ears so greedy of every circumstance connected with it as were those of Edward, yet it is wonderful how very short a time sufficed to point out the keystone of the arch, upon which the whole wonderful fabric hung, and then it was that Fanny Fletcher's voice was heard exclaiming in a burst of uncontrollable emotion,</p>
<p n="ENG184003029">"Then it was I that caused it all! Oh! Miss Brotherton, it was I who kept him in that horrid place for years! Had I not told you he was dead, it would have been he who would have been the happy object of your bounty, instead of me! Oh! how can he ever forgive me?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003030">This was uttered with such agitated rapidity, that though there was more than one present, who would have been ready enough to contradict the self-accusing statement, she gave them no time for it. But it sufficed to draw Michael from the side of his brother, and to place him at hers; and though this terrible thought drew a shower of tears from Fanny's eyes, notwithstanding the exceeding happiness which was at the very same moment throbbing at her heart; it may be that there could not have been found a more effectual mode of at once bringing back the long-parted friends to the same tone of familiar intercourse in which they had parted, as this sincere self-recrimination on one part, and the warm pleading against its injustice, on the other. For some minutes this lasted without being interrupted by a word from any one; for both Mary and Edward found, sufficient occupation in looking at them both, and then exchanging expressive glances of thanksgiving and happiness with each other. But at length, upon Fanny's saying with a fresh burst of tears,</p>
<p n="ENG184003031">"Oh, Michael! Michael! your eloquence is all in vain. You will never, never teach me to forget that I have been enjoying the blessed destiny intended for you, and that by means of words uttered by myself."</p>
<p n="ENG184003032">Upon her saying this, the happy Mary Brotherton pushed a low tabouret before the reunited friends, and seating herself upon it, took Fanny's hand in hers, and said, "If you would not cry about it, my Fanny, I should think it was a mighty pretty exhibition of true feeling and false argument that we were witnessing; but if you really intend to be unhappy, we shall all range ourselves immediately on Michael's side, and laugh you to scorn for your sophistry, and the deplorable confusion you are making between cause and effect. I should like to know, little lady, how much it would have profited our Michael had you refused to answer when I inquired at the Deep Valley factory, if you knew aught about him? had you, while firmly believing he was dead, declined to state your belief, lest you might be mistaken, what would it have availed him, darling? Could he have crept down before us from his sick bed to settle the question? No, dear casuist you know better. Your looks are much more wise than your words, Fanny; for even now, though you pretend to shake your head, your truth-telling eyes confess that you have not another syllable to say."</p>
<p n="ENG184003033">"But is it not singular," said Martha, who had been contemplating the scene with unspeakable delight, "is it not singular that Michael should twice have been the victim of words, uttered by such very friendly lips?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003034">"Singular, dear Martha?" replied Mary; "is not every event connected with a hero of romance, of necessity and by immutable prescription, singular? And whom did Fate and Fortune ever fix upon more unmistakably to fill that distinguished position in society, than Michael Armstrong? Why are we all here together? Wholly and solely because Michael Armstrong saved Lady Clarissa Shrimpton from the terrors inspired by a cow — is it not so, dear friends? Can any of you deny that all the exceeding happiness that blesses us at this moment, has arisen from that most marvellously silly adventure? And shall we any of us quarrel at the steps (though some of them it must be confessed were rough enough), which have led from that nousensical beginning, to an end that has made us all so very happy? Yes! Michael Armstrong is a hero; he is our hero; he is the crowning blessing that is come to make us all thank Heaven for having brought us every one from greater and less degrees of misery, to very perfect pahpiness, and shall we not welcome him with smiles, instead of tears, Fanny?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003035">Nothing could have been more admirably suited to the effect which the happy heiress meant to produce, than these words. How, after this, could Michael shrink, as he had expected to do, from the humiliating comparison between Edward and Fanny, with himself? Or how could Fanny persist in weeping, when her own heart, as well as those of all around her, was so cheeringly called upon to rejoice? Nothing of the sort was any longer thought of by either.</p>
<p n="ENG184003036">Without very well knowing how it came about, Michael, of all the multitude of contending feelings which had been lately so cruelly assailing him, being as they were, of that most harassing race begotten between fear and hope, was now conscious of only one, and that one was happiness unmixed. His frank and generous nature could no longer harbour any doubts as to the place he held in the affections of those whom he had lately thought of, as almost too high and too happy to remember him. He was with them, he was of them. If a thought of the future glanced athwart the delicious present, it came accompanied by a buoyant consciousness that there was that within him which would enable him to redeem lost time, and that whatever those he loved wished him to be, THAT he should have power to become.</p>
<p n="ENG184003037">Nor was an answering confidence wanting in those who wearied not of gazing at his bright, expressive features, and his noble form. Fanny thought that he was exactly every thing she would have dreamed he must be, had she ventured to dream that he existed at all. Marry thought that she read capacity which promised power to become all that Edward could wish him to be — and she was not disposed to wish for more — and Edward himself thought and felt that had he power to choose a brother from among all the nations of the earth, and the noblest of them, Michael would have been the one he would have selected.</p>
<p n="ENG184003038">"And where is my dear, good Tremlett?" said Miss Brotherton. "In the midst of all this rare felicity she must not be left out. She has shared our mourning for your loss, dear Michael, and shame it were she should not share our joy at finding you."</p>
<p n="ENG184003039">"Shall I go and call her hither?" cried Fanny, rising."</p>
<p n="ENG184003040">"No! that you shall not, Fanny," replied Miss Brotherton. "I will not trust you. It was I who dragged the dear good soul from post to pillar, in order to find you, Michael. — It was I who never let her know rest, night nor day, because you were not, and who but I shall bring her the glad tidings of your restoration?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003041">But truly delighted as was Mary Brothrton at the idea of the pleasure which she well knew this unlooked-for arrival would cause her old friend, she would not let her taste it without the addition of a little mystification; and accordingly she led her into the room which contained the happy party, with no other preparation than telling her that there was a young Englishman in the saloon, to whom she must come and be introduced, because he was a countryman.</p>
<p n="ENG184003042">To this the tractable old lady agreed, without testifying any very lively emotion; but when she had got into the midst of the group, and witnessed the general exaltation of spirits which seemed to possess them all, after looking and listening for a little while she could not help whispering to Fanny, "Do you know, my dear, who that young man is? I never saw Miss Brotherton — no! nor Mr. Armstrong either — seem to be so extraordinarily intimate with any one before, just at first sight."</p>
<p n="ENG184003043">In reply to this Fanny only hid her face, and laughed, for she dared not trust her voice to give the information required.</p>
<p n="ENG184003044">"How very odd," murmured the old lady, drawing her knitting from her bag.</p>
<p n="ENG184003045">"It is very odd, Mrs. Tremlett, very odd indeed," said Mary, "there is no denying it. But the fact is, that Mr. Armstrong has taken such an extraordinary fancy to this young man, that I really think I shall be obliged to ask him to live with us. There will be plenty of room, you know, in my Rhenish castle."</p>
<p n="ENG184003046">The old lady said not a word in reply, but she looked puzzled, and vexed, and shook her head, as much as to say that it was not like her young mistress to talk such nonsense as that. So in her own defence Mary was obliged to explain the mystery, and as happy an old woman was nurse Tremlett, as she looked and listened, as ever tasted joy from the contemplation of it in others.</p>
<p n="ENG184003047">A TÊTE'-À-TÊTE — A SECOND — A THIRD — A MYSTERIOUS RESULT — CONCLUSION.</p>
<p n="ENG184003048">Delightful as was this state of mind to all that shared it, it could not last. Michael was too much in earnest in his dread of being a burden upon Miss Brotherton to permit many days to pass before he begged her to let him converse with her for a few moments in private; and Mary, who had already seen quite enough to convince her that the affection which Michael and Fanny had conceived for each other, amidst the dreary misery of the Deep Valley Mill, was not likely to be forgotten in the gay happiness of Nice, fully anticipated an humble confession, on the part of Michael, that he could not be happy without her permission to become the acknowledge lover of her charming friend and protégée, and very amiable, frank, and noble-minded, did she consider it in him, thus openly to avow the truth at once. But nothing could be further from the thoughts of Michael than making any such confession as this; which, it may be observed, is by no means saying that his heart was either innocent or unconscious of the presumptuous passion she attributed to it.</p>
<p n="ENG184003049">Greatly, however, did Miss Brotherton underrate the young man's character when she conceived that the gracious favour with which she had received him, could generate in his heart a wish to ask for more.</p>
<p n="ENG184003050">"It is taking a great liberty, madam," began Michael.</p>
<p n="ENG184003051">"If you love me, do not call me madam, my dear Michael," she replied. "Do you not perceive that Edward and Fanny both call me Mary? and till I had taught them to do so I never could feel that they quite understood the true spirit of my attachment towards them, or the mode and manner of existence which I have imagined for myself, and which must have fallen to the ground, if I had found them incapable of being to me, or letting me be to them, all that I wished and desired. You must not, dearest Michael, come and shake this perfect and delightful union, introducing forms and ceremonies foreign to our manners, and our feelings. Pray do not look so grave, dear friend! Promise to offend thus no more, and I will cease to scold you."</p>
<p n="ENG184003052">"Dearest Miss Brotherton!" said Michael. But this did not satisfy the exigeante lady, who shook her head, and held up her finger in reproof. "Dearest Mary! then — " he resumed, colouring brightly, and with a smile that made her think she could trace a family likeness to Edward, "the greatest wish I have on earth is to become such as you might approve, and if I shrink from the dear and precious familiarity which must make Edward and Fanny so happy, think not that I am incapable of loving you as perfectly as they do; but remember, dearest lady! that however humble their origin, the very circumstance of their having been your honoured companions for years, is of itself sufficient to raise them to such a tone of thinking and of manners, as may, in some sort, justify their using the privilege you so graciously afford. But, alas! You must know too well that the case is far different with me. The overflowing joy of our first meeting, naturally broke down, as it were, all inequalities, all boundaries, and I certainly felt, and perhaps spoke, as if I too were one of the accomplished little circle that might call this earthly paradise their home. But reflection will come, most generous Mary! if not amidst the happy intoxicating moments of the day, it will make itself a voice in the quiet reasoning meditations of the night, and so loudly has this voice been heard by me, that I cannot — no, in spite of all the happiness that surrounds me, I cannot live on thus, an idle, ignorant dependant on your bounty."</p>
<p n="ENG184003053">The heiress was half vexed, but more than half pleased by this trembling address, the deep sincerity of which was testified by the working features of a countenance more than commonly expressive of all that passed within. She had enjoyed so much genuine happiness since that arrival of Michael, and had watched with pleasure so exquisite the happiness of Edward and Fanny, that she almost trembled at the idea of any change; yet she knew the boy was right; she knew that he ought to apply himself immediately and strenuously to such studies as were most necessary for the redeeming the time he had lost, and so well aware was she of this, that, notwithstanding her unwillingness to part with him, she rejoiced heartily to find that she was wrong as to the subject on which she had suspected he wished to speak. Had she been right in her conjecture, all she could have done would have been to endow the boy and girl with such a portion of her wealth as might have sufficed to make them independent; but under such circumstances, all notion of essential improvement must of course be abandoned for ever, and for many reasons this would have been a source of lasting regret to her. It was therefore with cordial approbation that after the interval of a few moments, she replied, "Michael, you are right. Nature has done so much for you, my dear friend, that our wish to keep you constantly with us might easily, had you shown less courage, have tempted us to fancy that you wanted nothing which you have not got, or which we could not give you. But you are quite right in refusing to consent to this. We will immediately return to Germany where you shall be placed at the same admirable institution that so rapidly made your brother what you now see him. Two yeas of well-directed devotion to study, my dear Michael, will perhaps make you feel more at your ease among us, though I doubt, if it can produce any change which will make us love you better.</p>
<p n="ENG184003054">"Miss Brotherton! dearest Miss Brotherton!" exclaimed Michael — while perhaps the brightest beam of hope that ever yet shot from his eyes, met hers as she affectionately gazed upon him, "that was not what I — what I dared venture to hope and ask for. What you now propose, would be a happiness, the idea of which I think I should have turned from, even in my dreams, from shame at its towering ambition. All I meant to ask was, your kind aid to place me in some business where I might earn a maintenance, that in a year or two might prevent my being a burden to you — and now — "</p>
<p n="ENG184003055">"And now, Michael, I tell you fairly, that I have not the slightest intention of doing any such thing. Besides my own particular objection to such a mode of proceeding, I have lately heard a little anecdote of you, from your friend Martha, which makes it very doubtful whether you deserve that species of independence — for she put it in your possession once, you know — and you could not keep it. I shall manage better, Michael, depend upon it. One week more of idleness in this sweet spot — and then we travel back to Germany. You shall not be left to study in a more forsaken condition than was your brother. We shall be within an easy distance of you, my dear Michael. One corner of my castle must hold us, while another is beautified, and it is likely enough the work will go on all the better for our being there."</p>
<p n="ENG184003056">"And your visit to Rome given up for my sake?" cried Michael. "Oh! no, no, no!"</p>
<p n="ENG184003057">"No, no, no, most certainly," replied Mary, laughing, "I would not give up that journey, Michael, for more than I will say, "All is not lost that is delayed." Instead of giving up the plan, I only mean to improve it. Tell me, and tell me honestly, dear Michael, do you not think in your heart that we shall, one and all, enjoy this journey more if you are with us?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003058">"Mary!" exclaimed the boy, wholly overcome, and seizing and kissing her hand with an emotion that at once and for ever banished all reserve, "Mary! it is your will to be loved, and who can disobey? But my happiness seems greater than I can bear! Where is Edward? Let me walk, and talk with him! He is used to you, Mary, and all this may not seem to him so very much like a dream as it does to me. If he tells me it is all real, I shall believe it;" and with these words, and his fine face glowing with all the best and happiest feelings of our nature, Michael bounded from the presence of his benefactress to seek his brother.</p>
<p n="ENG184003059">"I might have lived a good while in my fine house, at Milford, and received a prodigious number of complimentary visits from my elegant neighbours, before I should have enjoyed half an hour as I have done this," thought the happy Mary Brotherton, as she strolled out through an open window, that led to a little garden of orange-trees. "How delicious is the air this morning!" But where was the climate, where, at that moment, she would have felt it to be otherwise?</p>
<p n="ENG184003060">Michael had no difficulty in finding his brother, who in truth was lingering near, on purpose to question him after this interview.</p>
<p n="ENG184003061">"Come with me, Edward!" cried the agitated boy, seizing his arm; "here are our hats — come with me into that little grove yonder — my heart will burst if I do not instantly tell you what has passed." And arm-in-arm they crossed the road, and a small enclosure opposite, and there found themselves under the shelter of a little wood, thick enough to exclude the peering eyes of mortals, as well as that of the sun.</p>
<p n="ENG184003062">Notwithstanding their eagerness for the communication which was to follow, and which was pretty equally strong in both, not a word was uttered by either till they reached this covert, and then, Michael, throwing himself upon a bank, and casting his hat away, clasped his hands, and raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed, "Edward, she is an angel!"</p>
<p n="ENG184003063">Edward had not followed his brother's example, in lying down, but stood before him in act to listen. But there was something in these words that seemed to shake him, for he turned away without answering.</p>
<p n="ENG184003064">"Has she ever named to you her plans about me?" resumed Michael.</p>
<p n="ENG184003065">"Yes!" replied Edward.</p>
<p n="ENG184003066">"Then you know that it is not her intention to assist me, by enabling me to learn any trade in handicraft?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003067">"No such idea, Michael, ever entered her head," said Edward, gravely.</p>
<p n="ENG184003068">"But, my dear fellow! you seem to take all this so very coolly. Do you know that it is her intention to send me to the same place where your education was completed? — Do you know that she gives up — no — that she postpones her journey to Italy, till I am ready to go with her? — Edward, do you know all this?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003069">"My dear brother," replied Edward, "I only know, that from the moment she learnt you were alive, she determined that she would immediately make you perfectly independent, as she has done me. All the rest, I think, depended upon your own inclination — and had she not found you disposed for this scheme, she would not have insisted upon it."</p>
<p n="ENG184003070">"Disposed for it, Edward? Oh! what cold, what chilling words! You could not speak so, if you thought there were any hope of my so profiting by it as to become a fit companion for you — for her — for Fanny. But it is too late — you feel that it is too late — is it not so, Edward?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003071">"No, Michael, no!" returned Edward, with sudden animation. "With your faculties, your eager desire to learn, and the masters you will have to put you in the way of doing so, I KNOW hat the result of these two years of study will be all you wish, and all your friends can desire."</p>
<p n="ENG184003072">"Then how can you receive this glorious news, my Edward, so composedly?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003073">"First, dear Michael, because it is no news to me. And secondly, because I am a selfish wretch, and was thinking, perhaps, more of my own interest than of yours. Forgive me for it, my own dear Michael! But I would rather have had it decided that we should have both marched off, and taken service under the Emperor of Austria. I know that commissions would have been obtained for us."</p>
<p n="ENG184003074">Michael, as his brother uttered these words, looked up into his face with an expression of such astonishment and dismay, that the blood rushed to Edward's face, and he turned away to conceal his confusion.</p>
<p n="ENG184003075">"Edward! you are a mystery to me," exclaimed Michael, springing upon his feet, and taking his brother by the arm. "Can it be possible that you are weary of the life you lead? Oh, heaven! and such a life!"</p>
<p n="ENG184003076">"Weary? am I weary of it, Michael? weary of rising every day to feel that I am a wretch unworthy to breathe the breath of life any where? And oh! how utterly unworthy to breathe it here!"</p>
<p n="ENG184003077">It was now poor Michael's turn to change colour, and he did so pretty violently — for first he became very red, and then exceedingly pale. That Edward, such as he had ever remembered him, such as he found him now, that he should so very solemnly declare himself to be a wretch unworthy of life, was a horror and a misery as terrible as it was unexpected. He had no power to utter any soothing in contradiction to this appalling statement, for, alas! it might be true — and Michael's heart sunk within him as he remembered how totally ignorant he was of every thing that might enable him to disbelieve it. Silently the brothers walked on for some paces, side by side. They were both of them either unwilling, or unable to speak. At length a sort of shuddering emotion that passed through Michael's frame, made itself felt by the arm of Edward, which he still held, and then he stopped, and without raising his eyes from the ground, said,</p>
<p n="ENG184003078">"Michael! How is it you understand me? Do you suppose that I have been guilty of some criminal act, such as dooms man to the gallows? If not, why do you shudder thus?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003079">"Would you not shudder, Edward, if you heard me say, that I was a wretch unworthy to live?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003080">"Poor Michael! perhaps I might; but still I doubt if I should understand the phrase as you do. It is so difficult, so impossible to express temperately and soberly, my own reprobation of the feelings that destroy me! And yet, dear Michael," he continued more tranquilly, "I could have fancied that there was something working in your own heart which might have taught you in some degree to guess the state of mine — I have no strength, no courage to enter on the guilty subject fully — but — that you may not think me a felon, Michael, I will tell you in one audacious word, I LOVE, and that with a fervour, a vehemence of passion, that often makes me tremble at myself — for did it ever master me so far as to force a confession of it in the presence of its object, I never could look up again, but must and would for ever become an alien from all I love, and a friendless wanderer on the face of the earth."</p>
<p n="ENG184003081">Though shocked more deeply than he had any wish or power to express, Michael could not resist the belief, which came with terrible strength upon him, that his unhappy brother had conceived a passion for some married woman, and that his best chance of recovering both his virtue and his tranquillity would be by following the wish he had expressed, and by entering on a new and active career, to give himself a chance of obliterating from his mind the feelings which had so unhappily taken possession of it. Such a destination for Edward must of course destroy some the very brightest of his own beautiful day-dreams: but there was a fund of integrity and real goodness in the heart of Michael that permitted him not at that moment to think of himself. "Edward!" said he solemnly, "if this be so, follow the course that your better feelings have suggested — adopt at once the profession of a soldier. It has ever been accounted a noble one — though, under happier circumstances — but that matters not — if your passions have led you wrong, let your principles bring you back again. Confess the truth to your generous benefactress at once."</p>
<p n="ENG184003082">"Michael!" replied Edward, looking in his face with an expression of suffering that almost amounted to agony — "I would rather die first." These words seemed intended to close the conversation, or at any rate they did so; for the two brothers silently retraced their path to the house, and a fond pressure, expressive of love and pity, which Michael gave to the arm of Edward before he parted from it, was all that passed between them further at that time.</p>
<p n="ENG184003083">The interview of that morning with Miss Brotherton had awakened in the mind of Michael, feelings towards her which an hour before he would have thought it must have taken years to produce; but being equally sincere, both in his former timidity and his present confidence, he speedily made up his mind to open his heart to her, and do for his guilty, but suffering brother, what it was evident he had not courage to do for himself. In pursuance of this resolution, he again sought the heiress, and whispered in her ear, "Mary! — will you let me talk to you a little more?" She eagerly complied with the implied invitation, and passing her arm through his, accompanied him to the scene of their former tête-à-tête .</p>
<p n="ENG184003084">There was no shyness on the part of Michael. The familiar appellation he had used was not assumed for the purpose of proving his obedience, but resulted from a genuine feeling of affectionate confidence in every word she had uttered, and which had left on his mind the belief that she was not only his generous patroness, but his loving friend.</p>
<p n="ENG184003085">"I little thought when I was talking to you this morning about my poor self," he said, "that I should so soon have to take you away again from your drawing, to talk about Edward."</p>
<p n="ENG184003086">"About Edward?" said Mary colouring, "what do you wish to say about him, dear Michael?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003087">"It is something that he declares he would die rather than say to you himself," replied Michael, "but I am certain that you ought to know it, for it is quite clear that there is no chance of happiness for him unless you agree to his wishes."</p>
<p n="ENG184003088">"What wishes?" exclaimed the heiress, terribly agitated, "for goodness sake, Michael, do not trifle with me! Did Edward commission you to speak to me?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003089">"Oh, no! had he felt courage to do that , I should have told him at once, that he had better do it himself," replied Michael. "Indeed I fear greatly that he will be displeased with me; but I cannot bear to see him so miserable without mentioning it to the only person capable of helping him."</p>
<p n="ENG184003090">"Miserable? — Helping him? — Tell me, Michael, tell me at once what you mean!"</p>
<p n="ENG184003091">"That is exactly what I wish to do, dear Mary!" replied Michael, looking with considerable surprise at her varying colour, and agitated features; "but I fear I am doing wrong, and that I have already said something that vexes you."</p>
<p n="ENG184003092">"No, no!" cried Mary impatiently, "only, go on!"</p>
<p n="ENG184003093">"In one word, then," resumed Michael, "our dear Edward wishes beyond all things to enter the Austrian service."</p>
<p n="ENG184003094">"And leave us!" returned the heiress, almost gasping. "Does Edward want to leave me?"</p>
<p n="ENG184003095">"Do not suspect him of ingratitude, Mary!" cried Michael, eagerly; "there is a reason for it, and without this I am quite sure he would never think of such a thing. — Edward has conceived an unfortunate passion for an object from whom he ought to fly — and this, of course, will explain every thing to you."</p>
<p n="ENG184003096">"Let me see him! Let me hear him! From himself, and from himself only I can hear this. Let it mean what it may." On uttering these words, which were spoken with a very agitated and untranquil air, Mary Brotherton rushed out of the room, much to Michael's astonishment; for he could by no means comprehend why she should testify such very strong emotion, especially as he had so cautiously and delicately avoided hinting any thing about a married woman's being unhappily the object of his brother's passion.</p>
<p n="ENG184003097">In this ignorance of Michael's, the reader, I am very sorry to say, must share. There are some fact which no wise historian will ever venture to dilate upon, lest their strangeness should provoke incredulity; and great wisdom is shown by such forbearance; for it is infinitely better that an elightened public should be driven to exclaim, " How very obscure this passage is! " than " How very improbable! "</p>
<p n="ENG184003098">Michael Armstrong is the hero of the book that is now drawing rapidly to its conclusion; and every reader has therefore a right to expect that his destiny shall be plainly announced to them, whatever mystery may hang over that of others. Whatever occurred between the heiress and Edward in the conference which they speedily held together, it did not cause any alteration in that lady's purpose of immediately returning to her chateau upon the Rhine. A man of worth and great ability was engaged to take charge of the richly teeming eager mind of Michael, during the two years that it was settled he should remain at a German university, and nothing could be more satisfactory than the result of this arrangement. Never, perhaps, were two years put to greater profit in the development of mind, than upon this occasion; and when they were ended, Michael Armstrong was able to take his station upon the beautiful terrace, without feeling that he was out of his place there.</p>
<p n="ENG184003099">Less than these two years had sufficed to bring to perfection all Mary Brotherton's plans for improving and beautifying her spacious residence. It was one of those super-terranean quarries which are sometimes seen to spread themselves to such miraculous extent in that region, and would have inspired most ladies with a feeling of dreary vastness, which, notwithstanding the exceeding beauty of its position, would have prevented any hope of rendering it comfortably habitable. But Mary had an ample heart, and an ample purse. Circumstances over which (to use a thoroughly authorized expression) she had no control, for in truth they had preceded her birth, had rendered her own country less dear to her than it is to most others; and she therefore not only determined to plant herself elsewhere, but to do so in such a manner as would enable her to make her new abode her home, in the best sense of the word, and this could only be done by giving. "Ample room, and verge enough," to make it the home of others also. Any travellers lucky enough to light upon this widely-spreading, but comfortable and thoroughly well kept-up abode, will find that, notwithstanding its great extent, it has, by no means, the air of being uninhabited. Nobody will be much surprised to hear that Michael Armstrong and Fanny Fletcher became man and wife, or that they proved a loving and very happy pair; but, should any curious Rhenish tourist obtain an introduction to this Rhingau paradise, they will probably observe two very loving and happy pairs, to whom it serves as a common yet, in some sort, a separate home, each having its suite of drawing-rooms, boudoirs, nurseries, school-rooms, elcætera . But however much a gossiping inclination might lead to a more explicit detail, there is really no room left to enter upon it. All that can be said in addition to this is, that when Sir Matthew Dowling's affairs came to be wound up, there was discovered to be a sufficient surplus to afford a small independence to each of his children, which, being divided according to the proportion dictated by the knight's will, gave something approaching to a Benjamin's mess portion to his daughter Martha. To claim and receive this, as well as occasionally to visit some members of her family, Martha made frequent excursions to England: but her happiest hours were those she passed with her dear friends in Germany, by whom she is ever received with open arms.</p>
<p n="ENG184003100">Mrs. Tremlett is still enjoying an old age of perfect comfort, cheered by warm affection, and is already the darling of many little hearts.</p>
<p n="ENG184003101">There is no record to be found in any documents relating to the inhabitants of the chateau, showing that Edward Armstrong ever entered the Austrian service. It is, therefore, most reasonable to suppose that this wish was never complied with.</p>
