<sample><p n="ENG18930832"><said direct="true">"I don't think it's likely you said that,"</said><said direct="false"> said he, capturing Dodo's hand, "because it isn't true."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930833"><said direct="true">"I am certainly de trop,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured Mrs. Vivian, turning to go.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930834"><said direct="false">Dodo's hand lay unresistingly in his.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930835"><said direct="true">"She has been so good and brave,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lord Chesterford to Mrs. Vivian, "she makes me feel ashamed."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930836"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian felt an immense admiration for him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930837"><said direct="true">"I said you deserved a very great deal,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, putting out her hand to him. "I must go, my carriage has been waiting an hour."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930838"><said direct="false">He retained Dodo's hand, and they saw her to the door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930839"><said direct="false">The footman met them in the hall.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930840"><said direct="true">"Mr. Broxton wants to know whether you can see him, my lady,"</said><said direct="false"> he said to Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930841"><said direct="true">"Would you like to see Jack?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked Chesterford.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930842"><said direct="true">"I would rather you told him you can't,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930843"><said direct="true">"Of course I will,"</said><said direct="false"> she answered. She turned to the footman. "Say I am engaged, but he may come again to-morrow and I will see him. You don't mind my seeing him, do you, Chesterford?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930844"><said direct="true">"No, no, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930845"><said direct="false">Dodo and Chesterford turned back to the drawing-room. Jack was on the steps.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930846"><said direct="true">"I thought you were engaged at this hour,"</said><said direct="false"> Mrs. Vivian said to him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930847"><said direct="true">"So I was,"</said><said direct="false"> he answered. "Dodo asked me to come and see her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930848"><said direct="false">It was just three weeks after the baby's death, and Dodo was sitting in her room about eleven o'clock in the morning, yawning dismally over a novel, but she was conscious of a certain relief, a sense of effort suspended. Late the evening before, Lord Chesterford had consulted her about some business down at Harchester, and Dodo, in a moment of inspiration, had said that it must be done by someone on the spot, that an agent was not to be trusted, and that if Chesterford liked she would go. This, of course, led to his offering to go himself, and would Dodo come with him? Dodo had replied that she was quite willing to go, but that there was no need of both of them making a tiresome journey on an infernally hot day. Chesterford had felt, rather wistfully, that he would not mind the journey if Dodo was with him, but he had learned lately not to say such things. Dodo was apt to treat them as nonsense. "My coming with you wouldn't make it any cooler, or less insufferably dusty," she would have said. The result was that Chesterford went, and Dodo was left alone' in London, with a distinct sense of relief and relaxation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930849"><said direct="false">Dodo's next move was to send a note to Jack, saying that he was going to come and lunch with her. She was not conscious of any sense of deception in this, but she had seen that Chesterford had not cared to see anybody since the baby's death, except Mrs. Vivian, whereas she longed to be in the midst of people again. So, whenever opportunities occurred, she had been in the habit of seeing what she could of her friends, but was very careful not to bore her husband with them. She was quite alive to the truth of Mrs. Vivian's remarks.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930850"><said direct="false">But though Dodo felt a great relief in her husband's absence, she was more than ever conscious of the unutterable stupidity of spending, day after day doing nothing. It was something even to keep it up with Chesterford, but now there was nothing to do—nothing. Still, Jack, was coming to lunch, and perhaps she might get through a few hours that way. Chesterford had said Be would be back that night late or next morning.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930851"><said direct="false">The footman came in bearing a card. "Jack already," thought Dodo, with wonder. But it was not Jack. Dodo looked at it and pondered a moment. "Tell Lady Bretton I will see her," she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930852"><said direct="false">A few moments afterwards Lady Bretton rustled into the room. Dodo had always thought her rather like a barmaid, and she was sure that she would attract many customers at any public-house. She was charmingly pretty, and always said the right thing. Dodo felt she ought to know why she had come, but couldn't quite remember. But she was not left in doubt long.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930853"><said direct="true">"Dearest Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Bretton, "I have wanted to come and see you dreadfully, only I haven't been able. You know Lucas has been at home all this week."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930854"><said direct="false">Then it flashed upon Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930855"><said direct="true">"He comes of age to-day, you know, and we are giving a ball. I was so dreadfully shocked to hear your bad news, and am delighted to see you looking so well considering. Is Lord Chesterford at home?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930856"><said direct="true">"No,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, as if weighing something in her mind. "He may come to-night, but I don't really expect him till to-morrow morning."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930857"><said direct="true">"Has he gone on some visit?"</said><said direct="false"> asked she. "I didn't suppose—"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930858"><said direct="true">"No, he's only gone on business to Harchester. He hasn't, of course, been out at all. But—"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930859"><said direct="false">Dodo paused.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930860"><said direct="false">Then she got quickly up from her chair, and clapped her hands.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930861"><said direct="true">"Yes, I will come. I am dying to go out again. Who leads the cotillion with me? Tommy Ledgers, isn't it? Oh, I shall enjoy it. I'm nearly dead for want of something to do. And he can dance, too. Yes, I'll come, but I must be back by half-past two. Chesterford will perhaps come by the night train getting here at two. I daresay it will be late. Are you going to have the mirror figure? Do have it. There's no one like Ledgers for leading that. He led it here with me. It will be like escaping from penal servitude for life. Talk of treadmills! I'm at the point of death for want of a dance. Let it begin punctually. I'll be there by ten sharp if you like. Tell Prince Waldenech I'm coming. He wrote to say he wouldn't go unless I did. He's badly in love with me. That doesn't matter, but he can dance. All those Austrians can. I'm going to have a regular debauch."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930862"><said direct="true">"I'm delighted,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Bretton. "I came here to ask you whether you couldn't possibly come, but I hardly dated. Dear Dodo, it's charming of you. It will make all the difference. I was in despair this morning. I had asked Milly Cornish to lead with Ledgers, but she refused, unless I asked you again first. We'll have a triumphant arch, if you like, with 'Welcome to Dodo' on it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930863"><said direct="true">"Anything you like,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "the madder the merrier. Let's see, how does the hoop figure go?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930864"><said direct="false">Dodo snatched up an old cotillion hoop from where it stood in the corner with fifty other relics, and began practising it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930865"><said direct="true">"We must have this right,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "it's quite new to most people. You must tell Tommy to come here for an hour this afternoon, and we'll rehearse. You start with it in the left hand, don't you? and then cross it over, and hold your partner's hoop in the right. Damn—I beg your pardon—but it doesn't go right. No, you must send Ledgers. Shall I want castanets? I think I'd better. We must have the new Spanish figure. Ah, that is right."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930866"><said direct="false">Dodo went through a series of mysterious revolutions with the hoop.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930867"><said direct="true">"I feel like a vampire who's got hold of blood again,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, pausing to get her breath. "I feel like a fish put back into the water, like a convict back in his own warm nest. No charge for mixed metaphors. Supplied free, gratis, and for nothing," she said, with emphasis.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930868"><said direct="false">Lady Bretton put her head a little on one side, and gushed at her. Her manners were always perfect.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930869"><said direct="true">"Now, I'm going to send you off,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Jack's coming to lunch, and I've got a lot to do. Jack who?' Jack Broxton, of course. Will he be with, you to-night? No?—I shall tell him I'm coming. You see if he doesn't come too. You sent him a card, of course. After lunch I shall want Tommy. Mind he comes. Good-bye."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930870"><said direct="false">Dodo felt herself again. There was the double relief of Chesterford's absence, and there was something to do. She hummed a little French song, snapped her castanets, and pitched her novel into the grate.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930871"><said direct="true">"Oh, this great big world,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "you've been dead, and I've been dead for a month. Won't we have a resurrection this evening! Come in, Jack," she went on, as the door opened. "Here's your hoop. Catch it! Do you know the hoop figure? That's right; no, in your left hand. That's all with the hoop. Now we waltz."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930872"><said direct="false">Jack had a very vague idea as to why he happened to be waltzing with Dodo. It seemed to him rather like "Alice in Wonderland." However, he supposed it was all right, and on they went. A collision with the table, and a slow Stygian stream of ink dropping in a fatal, relentless manner on to the carpet, caused a stoppage, and Dodo condescended to explain, which she did all in one sentence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930873"><said direct="true">"Chesterford's gone to Harchester after some stuffy business, and I'm going to the Brettons' ball, you must come, Jack, I'm going to lead the cotillion with Tommy, I simply must go, I'm dying to go out again; and, oh, Jack, I'm awfully glad to see you, and why haven't you been here for the last twenty years, and I'm out of breath, never mind the ink."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930874"><said direct="false">Dodo stopped from sheer exhaustion, and dropped a blotting-pad on to the pool of ink, which had now assumed the importance of an inland lake.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930875"><said direct="true">"Blanche has been here this morning,"</said><said direct="false"> she continued, "and I told her I'd come, and would bring you. You must come, Jack. You're an awfully early bird, and I haven't got any worms for you, because they've all turned, owing to the hot weather, I suppose, and I feel so happy I can't talk sense. Tommy's coming this afternoon to practise. What time is it? Let's go and have lunch. That will do instead of worms. If Chesterford goes to attend to bailiff's business, why shouldn't I go and dance? It really is a kindness to Blanche. Nothing ought to stand in the way of a kindness. She was in despair; she told me so: herself. She might have committed suicide. It would have been pleasant to have a countess's corpse's blood on your head, wouldn't it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930876"><said direct="true">"I thought Chesterford was here,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930877"><said direct="true">"Oh, I'm not good enough for you,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Dodo. "That's very kind of you. I suppose you, wouldn't have come, if you had known I should have had no one to meet you. Well, there isn't a soul, so you can go away if you like, or join the footmen in the servants' hall. Oh, I am so glad to be doing something again."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930878"><said direct="true">"I'm awfully glad you're coming to-night,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack; "it'll do you good."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930879"><said direct="true">"Ain't it a lark?"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Dodo, in pure Lancashire dialect, helping herself largely to beefsteak. "Jack, what'll you drink? Do you want beer? I'll treat you to what you like. You may dissolve my pearls in vinegar, if it will give you any satisfaction. Fetch Mr. Broxton my pearls, I mean some beer," said Dodo, upsetting the salt. "Really, Jack, I believe I've gone clean cracked. I've upset a lot of salt over your coat. Pour some claret upon it. Oh, no, that's the other way round, but I don't see why it shouldn't do. Have some more steak, Jack. Where's the gravy spoon? Jack, have you been trying to steal the silver? Oh, there it is. Have some chopped carrots with it. Who's that ringing at our door-bell? I'm a little—Who is it, Walter? Just go out and see. Miss Staines? Tell her there's lunch going on and Jack's here. There's an inducement. Jack, do you like Edith? She's rather loud. Yes, I agree, but we all make a noise at times. Can't she stop? Oh, very well, she may go away again. I believe she wouldn't come because you were here, Jack. I don't think she likes you, but you're a very good sort in your way. Jack, will you say grace? Chesterford always says grace. Well, for a Christian gentleman not to know a grace! Bring some cigarettes, Walter, or would you rather have a cigar, Jack? And some black coffee. Well, I'm very grateful for my good dinner, and I don't mind saying so."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930880"><said direct="false">Dodo went on talking at the top of her voice, quite continuously. She asked Jack a dozen questions without waiting for the answer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930881"><said direct="true">"Where shall we go now, Jack?"</said><said direct="false"> she continued, when they had finished coffee—Dodo took three cups and a cigarette with each. "We must go somewhere. I can leave word for Ledgers to wait. Let's go to the Zoo and see all the animals in cages. Ah, I sympathise with them. I have only just got out of my cage myself."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930882"><said direct="false">Dodo dragged Jack off to the Zoo, on the top of a bus, and bought buns for the animals and fruit for the birds, and poked a fierce lion with the end of her parasol, which the brute bit off, and nearly fell over into the polar bear's tank, and had all her money stolen by a pickpocket.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930883"><said direct="false">Then she went back home, and found Lord Ledgers, whom she put through his paces, and then she had tea, and dressed for the ball. She had ordered a very remarkable ball-dress from Worth's, just before the baby's death, which had never yet seen the light. It was a soft grey texture, which Dodo said looked like a sunlit mist, and it was strictly half mourning. She felt it was a badge of her freedom, and put it on with a fresh burst of exultation. She had a large bouquet of orchids, which Lord Bretton had caused to be sent her, and a fan painted by Watteau, and a French hair-dresser came and "did" her hair. By this time dinner was ready; and after dinner she sat in her room smoking and singing French songs to Lord Ledgers, who had come to fetch her, and at half-past nine the carriage was announced. About the same moment another carriage drove up to the door, and as Dodo ran downstairs she found her husband in the hall.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930884"><said direct="false">She looked at him a moment with undisguised astonishment, and a frown gathered on her forehead.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930885"><said direct="true">"You here?"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I thought you weren't coming till late."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930886"><said direct="true">"I caught the earlier train,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "and where are you off to?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930887"><said direct="true">"I'm going to the Brettons' ball,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo frankly; "I can't wait."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930888"><said direct="false">He turned round and faced her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930889"><said direct="true">"Oh, Dodo, so soon?"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930890"><said direct="true">"Yes, yes, I must,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You know this kills me, this, sticking here with nothing to do from day to day, and nothing to see, and nobody to talk to. It's death; I can't bear it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930891"><said direct="true">"Very well,"</said><said direct="false"> he said gently, "you are quite right to go if you want to. But I am not coming, Dodo."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930892"><said direct="false">Dodo's face brightened.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930893"><said direct="true">"No, dear, they don't expect you. I thought you wouldn't be back."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930894"><said direct="true">"I shouldn't go in any case,"</said><said direct="false"> said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930895"><said direct="false">Lord Ledgers was here heard to remark "By Gad!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930896"><said direct="false">Dodo laid her hand on his shoulder, conscious of restraining her impatience.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930897"><said direct="true">"No, that's just the difference between us,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Go on, Tommy, get into the carriage. You don't want me not to go, dear, do you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930898"><said direct="true">"No, you are right to go, if you wish to,"</said><said direct="false"> he said again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930899"><said direct="false">Dodo grew impatient.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930900"><said direct="true">"Really, you might be more cordial about it,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I needn't have consulted you at all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930901"><said direct="false">Lord Chesterford was not as meek as Moses. He was capable of a sense of injustice.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930902"><said direct="true">"I don't know that you did consult me much,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "you mean to go in any case."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930903"><said direct="true">"Very well,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "I do mean to go. Good-night, old boy. I sha'n't be very late. But I don't mean to quarrel with you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930904"><said direct="false">Lord Chesterford turned into his room. But he would not keep Dodo, as she wished to go, even if he could have done so.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930905"><said direct="false">Ledgers was waiting in the carriage.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930906"><said direct="true">"Oh, the devil,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, as she stepped in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930907"><said direct="false">Lady Bretton's ball is still talked about, I believe, in certain circles, though it ought to have been consigned, with all other events of last year, to oblivion. It was very brilliant, and several princes shed the light of their presence on it. But, as Lord Ledgers was heard to remark afterwards, "There are many princes, but there is only one Dodo." He felt as if he was adapting a quotation from the Koran, which was somehow suitable to the positive solemnity of the occasion. Dodo can only be described as having been indescribable. Lucas, Lady Bretton's eldest son, in honour of whose coming of age the ball was given, can hardly allude to it even now. His emotions expressed themselves feebly in his dressing with even more care than usual, in hanging round Eaton Square, and in leaving cards on the Chesterfords as often as was decent.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930908"><said direct="false">Dodo was conscious of a frenzied desire to make the most of it, and to drown remembrance, for in the background of her mind was another picture, that she did not care to look at. There was a man she knew, leaning over a small dead child. The door of the room was half open, and a woman, brilliantly dressed, was turning to go out, looking back over her shoulder with a smile, half of impatience, half of pity, at the kneeling figure in the room. Through the half-open door came sounds of music and rhythmical steps, and a blaze of light. This picture had started unbidden into Dodo's mind, as she and Ledgers drove up to Lady Bretton's door, with such sudden clearness that she half wondered whether she had ever actually seen it. It reminded her of one of Orchardson's silent, well-appointed tragedies. In any case it gave her a rather unpleasant twinge, and she determined to shut it out for the rest of the evening, and, to do her justice, no one would have guessed that Dodo's brilliance was due to anything but pure spontaneity, or that, even in the deepest shades of her inmost mind, there was any remembrance that it needed an effort to stifle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930909"><said direct="false">Many women, though few men, were surprised to see her there, and there was no one who was not glad; but the question arose more than once in the minds of two or three people, "Would society stand it if she didn't happen to be herself?" Dodo had treated a select party of her friends to a private exhibition of skirt-dancing during supper-time. The music from the band was quite loud enough to be heard distinctly in a small, rather unfrequented sitting-out room, and there Dodo had displayed her incomparable grace of movement and limb to the highest advantage. Dodo danced that night with unusual perfection, and who has not felt the exquisite beauty of such motion? Her figure, clad in its long, clinging folds of diaphanous, almost luminous texture, stood out like a radiant statue of dawn against the dark panelling of the room; her graceful figure bending this way and that, her wonderful white arms now holding aside her long skirt, or clasped above her head; above all, the supreme distinction and conscious modesty of every posture seemed, to the little circle who saw her, to be almost a new revelation of the perfection of form, colour and grace.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930910"><said direct="false">Jack knew Dodo pretty well, but he stood and wondered. Was she a devil? was she a tiger? or was she, after all, a woman? Dodo had told him what had happened that evening, and yet he did not condemn her utterly. He knew how prison-like her life must have been to her during the last month. It was a thousand pities that Dodo's meat was Chesterford's poison, but he no more blamed Dodo for eating her meat than he blamed Chesterford for avoiding his poison; and to advance the conventional argument against Dodo, that her behaviour was not usual, was, equivalent to saying, "Why do you behave like yourself?" rather than, "Why don't you behave like other people?" Dodo's estimate of herself, as purely normal, was only another instance of her very abnormalness. No, on the whole, she was not a devil. The other question was harder to settle. Jack remembered a tigress he had seen that day with her at the Zoo. The brute had a small and perfectly fascinating tiger cub, in which she took a certain maternal pride; but when feeding-time came near, and the cub continued to be importunate, she gave it a cuff with her big velvety paw, and sent it staggering to the corner. Dodo's tiger cub was a mixture between Chesterford and the dead child, and Dodo's feeding-time had come round. Here she was feeding with an enviable appetite, and where was the cub? The tigress element was not wholly absent.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930911"><said direct="false">And yet, withal, she was a woman. Is it that certain attributes of pure womanliness run through the female of animals, or that every woman has a touch of the tigress about her? Jack felt incompetent to decide.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930912"><said direct="false">Dodo's dance came to an end. She accepted Prince Waldenech's arm, and went down to supper. As he advanced to her, Dodo dropped a curtsey, and he stooped and kissed her hand. "The brute," thought Jack, as he strolled out into the ballroom, where people were beginning to collect again. Many turned and looked at Dodo as, she passed out with her handsome partner. The glow of exercise and excitement and success burned brightly in her cheeks, and no one accused Dodo of using rouge. The supper was spread on a number of small tables, laid for four or six each. The Prince led her to an empty one, and sat down by her side.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930913"><said direct="true">"I have seen many beautiful things,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, in French, which permits a man to say more than he may I in English, "but none so beautiful as what I have seen to-night."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930914"><said direct="false">Dodo was far too accomplished a coquette to pretend not to know what he meant. She made him a charming little obeisance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930915"><said direct="true">"Politeness required that of your Highness,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "That is only my due, you know."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930916"><said direct="true">"I can never give you your due,"</said><said direct="false"> said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930917"><said direct="true">"My due in this case is the knowledge I have pleased you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930918"><said direct="false">Dodo felt suddenly a little uncomfortable. The forgotten picture flashed for a moment across her inward eye. She spoke of other things: praised the prettiness of the ballroom, the excellence of the band.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930919"><said direct="true">"Lady Bretton has given a fine setting to the diamond,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Prince, "but the diamond is not hers."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930920"><said direct="false">Dodo laughed. He was a little ponderous, and he deserved to be told so.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930921"><said direct="true">"You Austrians have beautiful manners,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "but you are too serious. English are always accused of sharing that fault, but anyhow, when they pay compliments, they have at least the air of not meaning what they say."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930922"><said direct="true">"That is the fault of the English, or of the compliment."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930923"><said direct="true">"No one means what they say when they pay compliments,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "They are only a kind of formula to avoid the unpleasantness of saying nothing."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930924"><said direct="true">"Austrians seldom pay compliments,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "but when they do, they mean them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930925"><said direct="true">"Ouf,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "that sounds homelike to you, doesn't it? All Austrians say 'ouf' in books—do they really say 'ouf,' by the way?—What a bald way of saying that I needn't expect any more to-night. Really, Prince, that's rather unflattering to you. No, don't excuse yourself; I understand perfectly. I'm not fishing for any more. Come, there's the pas de quatre beginning. That's the 'Old Kent Road' tune. It's much the best. What do you suppose 'Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road' means? No foreigner has ever been able to translate it to me yet. This is your dance, isn't it? O dear me, half the night's gone, and I feel as if I hadn't begun yet. Some people are in bed now; what a waste of time, you know."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930926"><said direct="false">The ball went on and on, and Dodo seemed to gather fresh strength and brilliance with each hour. Extra dances were added and still added, and many who were tired with dancing stayed and watched her. The princes went away, and nobody noticed their departure. If Cleopatra herself had suddenly entered the ballroom, she would have found herself at a discount. It was the culmination of Dodo's successes. She seemed different in kind, as well as in degree, from the crowd around her. Pretty women seemed suddenly plain and middle-aged; well-dressed women looked dowdy beside her, and when at length, as the electric light began to pale perceptibly before the breaking day, Dodo asked her partner to take her to Lady Bretton, the dancers stopped, and followed Dodo and Prince Waldenech, for she was dancing with him, to where Lady Bretton was standing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930927"><said direct="true">"It has been heavenly,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "It's a dreadful bore to have people come and say how much they have enjoyed themselves, but I've done it now. Tell Lucas I wish he would come of age every year; he really is a public benefactor."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930928"><said direct="false">She took Prince Waldenech's arm, and stood waiting with him, while her carriage detached itself from the others which lined the square, and drove up to the door. And, as they stood there, the crowd followed her slowly out of the ballroom, still silent, and still watching her, and lined the stairs, as she passed down to the front door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930929"><said direct="false">Then, when she had got into her carriage, and had driven off, they looked at each other as if they had all been walking in their sleep, and no one knew exactly why they were there. And a quarter of an hour later the rooms were completely empty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930930"><said direct="false">Meanwhile, as Dodo drove back through the still, cool, morning air, she threw down the windows of her carriage, and drew in deep satisfied breaths of its freshness. She thought of the crowds who had followed her down to the door, and laughed for pleasure. "It's life, it's life," she thought. "They followed me like sheep. Ah, how I love it!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930931"><said direct="false">It was nearly six when she reached home; "Decidedly it would be too absurd to go to bed," she thought. "I shall go for a glorious gallop, and come back to breakfast with Chesterford. Tell them to saddle Starlight at once," she said to the footman: "I sha'n't want a groom. And tell Lord Chesterford, when he wakes, that I shall be back to breakfast."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930932"><said direct="false">Chesterford did not let Dodo see how strongly he had felt on the subject of the ball. He argued to himself that it would do no good. Dodo would not understand, or, understanding, would misunderstand the strength of his feeling, and he did not care that she should know that he thought her heartless. He was quite conscious that matters were a little strained between them, though Dodo apparently was sublimely unaware, of it. She had a momentary nervousness when they met at breakfast, on the morning after the ball, that Chesterford was going to make a fuss, and she could not quite see what it would end in, if the subject was broached. But he came in looking as usual. He told her how matters had gone with him on the previous day, and had recounted, with a certain humour, a few sharp words which an old lady in his railway carriage had addressed to him, because he didn't help her to hand out two large cages of canaries which she was taking home.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930933"><said direct="false">Dodo welcomed all this as a sign of grace, and was only too happy to meet her husband half-way. He had been a trifle melodramatic on the previous evening, but we are all liable to make mountains out of molehills at times, she thought. Personally her inclination was to make molehills out of mountains, but that was only a difference in temperament; both implied a judgment at fault, and she was quite willing to forgive and forget. In a word, she was particularly nice to him, and when breakfast was over she took his arm, and led him away to her room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930934"><said direct="true">"Sit down in that very big chair, old boy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "and twiddle your thumbs while I write some notes. I'm going to see Mrs. Vivian this morning, and your lordship may come in my ladyship's carriage if it likes. Is lordship masculine, feminine, or neuter, Chesterford? Anyhow, it's wrong to say your lordship may come in your carriage, because lordship is the nominative to the sentence, and is in the third person—what was I saying? Oh, yes, you may come if it likes, and drop me there, and then go away for about half an hour, and then come back, and then we'll have lunch together at home."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930935"><said direct="true">"I've got to go to some stupid committee at the club,"</said><said direct="false"> said Chesterford, "but that's not till twelve. I'll send your carriage back for you, but I sha'n't be able to be in at lunch."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930936"><said direct="true">"Oh, very good,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Dodo. "I'm sorry I married you. I might be a lone lorn widdy for all you care. He prefers lunching at his club," she went on, dramatically, addressing the black virgin, "to having his chop at home with the wife of his bosom. How sharper than a serpent's tooth to have a thankless Chesterford!".</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930937"><said direct="false">Dodo proceeded to write her notes, and threw them one by one at her husband as he sat contentedly by the window, in the very big chair that Dodo had indicated.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930938"><said direct="false">Dodo's correspondence was as varied as the collection of photographs on her mantelpiece. The first note was to her groom at Winston, telling him to have another riding-horse sent up at once, as her own particular mare had gone lame. It missed Chesterford's head, and fell with an ominous clatter among some bric-à-brac and china.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930939"><said direct="true">"That'll be a bill for you to pay, darling,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo sweetly. "Why didn't you put your silly old head in the light?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930940"><said direct="false">The next was a slightly better shot, and fell right side upwards on to Chesterford's knee, but with the address upside down to him. He looked at it vaguely.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930941"><said direct="true">"His Serene Highness who?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked, spelling it out.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930942"><said direct="true">"That's not grammar,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "It's only to Prince Waldenech. He is Serene, isn't he? He looks it, anyhow. He was at the Brettons' last night. Austrian but amiable."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930943"><said direct="false">Chesterford was fingering the envelope.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930944"><said direct="true">"He's an unmitigated blackguard,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, after a little consideration. "I wish you'd let me tear it up, Dodo. What on earth have you got to say to him?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930945"><said direct="true">"I shall have to write it again, dear, if you do,"</said><said direct="false"> said she, conscious of bridling a rising irritation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930946"><said direct="true">"He really is an awful brute,"</said><said direct="false"> he repeated.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930947"><said direct="true">"Oh, my dear Chesterford, what does that matter?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo, impatiently tapping the floor with the toe of her shoe. "It isn't my business to go raking up the character of people I'm introduced to."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930948"><said direct="true">"You mean you don't mind what a man's character is as long as he's agreeable."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930949"><said direct="true">"It isn't my business to be court inquisitor,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Half of what one hears about people isn't true, and the other half—well, all you can say is, that it isn't exactly false."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930950"><said direct="false">Dodo could lose her temper very quickly on occasions, especially when she was in a hurry, as she was now.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930951"><said direct="true">"My dear Dodo, do you happen to know the story of—"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930952"><said direct="true">"No, I don't,"</said><said direct="false"> she said vehemently. "Shall I seem rude if I say I don't want to? I really think you might find something better to do than tell scandalous stories about people you don't know."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930953"><said direct="true">"I know all I want to know about Prince Waldenech,"</said><said direct="false"> said Chesterford, rising.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930954"><said direct="true">"You'll know more about him soon,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Dodo, "because I've asked him to stay at Winston. I suppose you think I wanted to make a secret about it. I have no such intention, I assure you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930955"><said direct="true">"Is this note to ask him to come?"</said><said direct="false"> he inquired.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930956"><said direct="true">"Certainly it is,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo defiantly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930957"><said direct="true">"I may as well tear it up,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "I don't mean him to be asked, Dodo. I don't wish to have him in the house."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930958"><said direct="false">Dodo had lost her temper thoroughly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930959"><said direct="true">"His being asked to Winston is immaterial,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, with scorn in her voice. "You certainly have the power to prevent his coming to your house. Your power I must regard, your wishes I shall not. I can see him in London with perfect ease."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930960"><said direct="true">"You mean you attach no weight to my wishes in this matter?"</said><said direct="false"> said Chesterford.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930961"><said direct="true">"None."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930962"><said direct="true">"Will no knowledge of what the man is really like, stop you holding further intercourse with him?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930963"><said direct="true">"None whatever, now!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930964"><said direct="true">"I don't wish it to be known that my wife associates with such people,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930965"><said direct="true">"Your wife does not regard it in that light,"</said><said direct="false"> replied Dodo. "I have no intention of proclaiming the fact from the housetops."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930966"><said direct="false">To do Chesterford justice he was getting angry too.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930967"><said direct="true">"It's perfectly intolerable that there should be this sort of dispute between you and me, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930968"><said direct="true">"That is the first point on which we have not differed."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930969"><said direct="true">"You entirely decline to listen to reason?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930970"><said direct="true">"To your reason, you mean,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930971"><said direct="true">"To mine or any honest man's."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930972"><said direct="false">Dodo burst out into a harsh, mirthless laugh.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930973"><said direct="true">"Ah, you're beginning to be jealous,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "It is very bourgeois to be jealous."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930974"><said direct="false">Chesterford coloured, angrily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930975"><said direct="true">"That is an insult, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Remember that there is a courtesy due even from a wife to her husband. Besides that, you know the contrary."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930976"><said direct="true">"Really, I know nothing of the sort,"</said><said direct="false"> she remarked. "Your whole conduct, both last night and this morning, has been so melodramatic, that I begin to suspect all sorts of latent virtues in you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930977"><said direct="true">"We are wandering from the point,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "Do you mean that nothing will deter you from seeing this Austrian?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930978"><said direct="true">"He is received in society,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "he is presentable, he is even amusing. Am I to tell him that my husband is afraid he'll corrupt my morals? If people in general cut him, I don't say that I should continue to cultivate his acquaintance. It is absurd to run amuck of such conventions. If you had approached me in a proper manner, I don't say that I mightn't have seen my way to meeting your wishes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930979"><said direct="true">"I don't feel I am to blame in that respect,"</said><said direct="false"> said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930980"><said direct="true">"That shows you don't know how far we are apart,"</said><said direct="false"> she replied.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930981"><said direct="false">He was suddenly frightened. He came closer to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930982"><said direct="true">"Far apart, Dodo? We?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930983"><said direct="true">"It seems to me that this interview has revealed some astonishing differences of opinion between us,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I don't wish to multiply words. You have told me what you think on the subject, and I have told you what I think. You have claimed the power a husband certainly possesses, and I claim the liberty that my husband cannot deprive me of. Or perhaps you wish to lock me up. We quite understand one another. Let us agree to differ. Give me that note, please. I suppose you can trust me not to send it. I should like to keep it. It is interesting to count the milestones."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930984"><said direct="false">Dodo spoke with the recklessness of a woman's anger, which is always much more unwanton than that of a man. A man does not say cruel things when he is angry, because they are cruel, but because he is angry. Dodo was cruel because she wished to be cruel. He gave her the note, and turned to leave the room. Dodo's last speech made it impossible for him to say more. The only thing he would not sacrifice to his love was his honour or hers. But Dodo suddenly saw the horrible impossibility of the situation. She had not the smallest intention of living on bad terms with her husband. They had quarrelled, it was a pity, but it was over. A storm may only clear the air; it is not always the precursor of bad weather. The air wanted clearing, and Dodo determined that it should not be the prelude of rain and wind. To her, of course, the knowledge that she did not love her husband had long been a commonplace, but to him the truth was coming in fierce, blinding flashes, and by their light he could see that a great flood had come down into his happy valley, carrying desolation before it, and between him and Dodo stretched a tawny waste of water. But Dodo had no intention of quarrelling with him, or maintaining a dignified reserve in their daily intercourse. That would be quite unbearable, and she wished there to be no misunderstanding on that point.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930985"><said direct="true">"Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "we've quarrelled, and that's a pity. I hardly ever quarrel, and it was stupid of me. I am sorry. But I have no intention of standing on my dignity, and I sha'n't allow you to stand on yours. I shall pull you down, and you'll go flop. You object to something which I propose to do, you exert your rights, as far as having him in the house goes, and I exert mine by going to see him. I shall go this afternoon. Your veto on his coming to Winston seems quite as objectionable to me, as my going to see him does to you. That's our position; accept it. Let us understand each other completely. C'est aimer." As she spoke she recovered her equanimity, and she smiled serenely on him. Scenes like this left no impression on her. The tragedy passed over her head; and, though it was written in the lines of her husband's face, she did not trouble to read it. She got up from her chair and went to him. He was standing with his hands clasped behind him near the door. She laid her hands on his shoulder, and gave him a little shake.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930986"><said direct="true">"Now, Chesterford, I'm going to make it up,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Twenty minutes is heaps of time for the most quarrelsome people to say sufficient nasty things in, and time's up. I'm going to behave exactly as usual. I hate quarrelling, and you don't look as if it agreed with you. Kiss me this moment. No, not on the top of my head. That's better. My carriage ought to be ready by this time, and you are coming with me as far as Prince's Gate."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930987"><said direct="false">Lord and Lady Chesterford were sitting at breakfast at Winston towards the end of September. He had an open letter in front of him propped up against his cup, and between mouthfuls of fried fish he glanced at it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930988"><said direct="true">"Dodo."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930989"><said direct="false">No answer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930990"><said direct="true">"Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> rather louder.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930991"><said direct="false">Dodo was also reading a letter, which covered two sheets and was closely written. It seemed to be interesting, for she had paused with a piece of fish on the end of her fork, and had then laid it down again. This time, however; she heard.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930992"><said direct="true">"Oh, what?"</said><said direct="false"> she said abstractedly. "Jack's coming to-day; I've just heard from him. He's going to bring his hunter. You can get some cub-hunting, I suppose, Chesterford? The hunt itself doesn't begin till the 15th, does it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930993"><said direct="true">"Ah, I'm glad he can come,"</said><said direct="false"> said Chesterford. "Little Spencer would be rather hard to amuse alone. But that isn't what I was going to say."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930994"><said direct="true">"What is it?"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, relapsing into her letter.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930995"><said direct="true">"The bailiff writes to tell me that they have discovered a rich coal shaft under the Far Oaks."</said><said direct="false"> A pause. "But, Dodo, you are not listening."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930996"><said direct="true">"I'm sorry,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Do you know, Jack nearly shot himself the other day at a grouse drive?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930997"><said direct="true">"I don't care,"</said><said direct="false"> said Chesterford brutally. "Listen, Dodo. Tompkinson says they've discovered a rich coal shaft under the Far Oaks. Confound the man, I wish he hadn't."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930998"><said direct="true">"Oh, Chesterford, how splendid!"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, dropping her letter in earnest. "Dig it up and spend it on your party, and they'll make you a duke for certain. I want to be a duchess very much. Good morning, your grace," said Dodo reflectively.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930999"><said direct="true">"Oh, that's impossible,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "I never thought of touching it, but the ass tells me that he's seen the news of it in the Staffordshire Herald. So I suppose everybody knows, and I shall be pestered."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301000"><said direct="true">"But do you mean to say you're going to let the coal stop there?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301001"><said direct="true">"Yes, dear, I can't possibly touch it. It goes right under all those oaks, and under the Memorial Chapel, close to the surface."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301002"><said direct="true">"But what does that matter?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo, in real surprise.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301003"><said direct="true">"I can't possibly touch it,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "you must see that. Why, the chapel would have to come down, and the oaks, and we don't want a dirty coal shaft in the Park."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301004"><said direct="true">"Chesterford, how ridiculous!"</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Dodo. "Do you mean you're going to leave thousands of pounds lying there in the earth?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301005"><said direct="true">"I can't discuss it, dear, even with you,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "The only question is whether we can stop the report of it going about."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301006"><said direct="false">Dodo felt intensely irritated.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301007"><said direct="true">"Really you are most unreasonable,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I did flatter myself that I had a reasonable husband. You were unreasonable about the Brettons' ball, and you were unreasonable about Prince Waldenech's coming here, and you are unreasonable about this."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301008"><said direct="false">Chesterford lost his patience a little.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301009"><said direct="true">"About the Brettons' ball,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "there was only one opinion, and that was mine. About the Prince's coming here, which we agreed not to talk about, you know the further reason. I don't like saying such things. You are aware what that officious ass Clayton told me was said at the club. Of course it was an insult to you, and a confounded lie, but I don't care for such things to be said about my wife. And about this—"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301010"><said direct="true">"About this,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "you are as obstinate as you were about those other things. Excuse me if I find you rather annoying."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301011"><said direct="false">Chesterford felt sick at heart.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301012"><said direct="true">"Ah, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "cannot you believe in me at all?" He rose and stood by her. "My darling, you must know how I would do anything for love of you. But these are cases in which that clashes with duty. I only want to be loved a little. Can't you see there are some things I cannot help doing, and some I must do?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301013"><said direct="true">"The things that you like doing,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, in a cool voice pouring out some more tea. "I don't wish to discuss this either. You know my opinion. It is absurd to quarrel; I dislike quarrelling with anybody, and more especially a person whom I live with. Please take your hand away, I can't reach the sugar."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301014"><said direct="false">Dodo returned to her letter. Chesterford stood by her for a moment, and then left the room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301015"><said direct="true">"It gets more and more intolerable every day. I can't bear quarrelling; it makes me ill,"</said><said direct="false"> thought Dodo, with a fine sense of irresponsibility. "And I know he'll come and say he was sorry he said what he did. Thank goodness, Jack comes to-day."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301016"><said direct="false">Chesterford, meanwhile, was standing in the hall, feeling helpless and bewildered. This sort of thing was always happening now, do what he could; and the intervals were not much better. Dodo treated him with a passive tolerance that was very hard to bear. Even her frank determination to keep on good terms with her husband had undergone considerable modification. She was silent and indifferent. Now and then when he came into her room he heard, as he passed down the passage, the sound of her piano or her voice, but when he entered Dodo would break off and ask him what he wanted. He half wished that he did not love her, but he found himself sickening and longing for Dodo to behave to him as she used. It would have been something to know that his presence was not positively distasteful to her. Dodo no longer "kept it up," as Jack said. She did not pat his hand, or call him a silly old dear, or pull his moustache, as once she did. He had once taken those little things as a sign of her love. He had found in them the pleasure that Dodo's smallest action always had for him; but now even they, the husk and shell of what had never existed, had gone from him, and he was left with that which was at once his greatest sorrow and his greatest joy, his own love for Dodo. And Dodo—God help him! he had learned it well enough now—Dodo did not love him, and never had loved him. He wondered what the end would be—whether his love, too, would die. In that case he foresaw that they would very likely go on living together as fifty other people lived—being polite to each other, and gracefully tolerant of each other's presence; that nobody would know, and the world would say, "What a model and excellent couple."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301017"><said direct="false">So he stood there, biting the ends of his long moustache. Then he said to himself, "I was beastly to her. What the devil made me say all those things."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301018"><said direct="false">He went back to the dining-room, and found Dodo as he had left her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301019"><said direct="true">"Dodo, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "forgive me for being so cross. I said a lot of abominable things."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301020"><said direct="false">Dodo was rather amused. She knew this would happen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301021"><said direct="true">"Oh, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "it doesn't signify. But are you determined about the coal mine?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301022"><said direct="false">Chesterford was disappointed and chilled. He turned on his heel and went out again. Dodo raised her eyebrows, shrugged her shoulders imperceptibly, and returned to her letter.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301023"><said direct="false">If you had asked Dodo when this state of things began she could probably not have told you. She would have said, "Oh, it came on by degrees. It began by my being bored with him, and culminated when I no longer concealed it." But Chesterford, to whom daily intercourse had become an awful struggle between his passionate love for Dodo and his bitter disappointment at what he would certainly have partly attributed to his own stupidity and inadequacy, could have named the day and hour when he first realised how far he was apart from his wife. It was when he returned by the earlier train and met Dodo in the hall going to her dance; that moment had thrown a dangerous clear light over the previous month. He argued to himself, with fatal correctness, that Dodo could not have stopped caring for him in a moment, and he was driven to the inevitable conclusion that she had been drifting away from him for a long time before that; indeed, had she ever been near him? But he was deeply grateful to those months when he had deceived himself, or she had deceived him, into believing that she cared for him. He knew well that they had been the happiest in his life, and though the subsequent disappointment was bitter, it had not embittered him. His love for Dodo had a sacredness for him that nothing could remove; it was something separate from the rest of his life, that had stooped from heaven and entered into it, and lo! it was glorified. That memory was his for ever, nothing could rob him of that.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301024"><said direct="false">In August Dodo had left him. They had settled a series of visits in Scotland, after a fortnight at their own house, but after that Dodo had made arrangements apart from him. She had to go and see her mother, she had to go here and there, and half way through September, when Chesterford had returned to Harchester expecting her the same night, he found a postcard from her, saying she had to spend three days with someone else, and the three days lengthened into a week, and it was only yesterday that Dodo had come and people were arriving that very evening. There was only one conclusion to be drawn from all this, and not even he could help drawing it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301025"><said direct="false">Jack and Mr. Spencer and Maud, now Mrs. Spencer, arrived that evening. Maud had started a sort of small store of work, and the worsted and crochet went on with feverish rapidity. It had become a habit with her before her marriage, and the undeveloped possibilities, that no doubt lurked within it, had blossomed under her husband's care. For there was a demand beyond the limits of supply for her woollen shawls and comforters. Mr. Spencer's parish was already speckled with testimonies to his wife's handiwork, and Maud's dream of being some day useful to somebody was finding a glorious fulfilment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301026"><said direct="false">Dodo, I am sorry to say, found her sister more unsatisfactory than ever. Maud had a sort of confused idea that it helped the poor if she dressed untidily, and this was a ministry that came without effort. Dodo took her in hand as soon as she arrived, and made her presentable. "Because you are a clergy-man's wife, there is no reason that you shouldn't wear a tucker or something round your neck," said she. "Your sister is a marchioness, and when you stay with her you must behave as if you were an honourable. There will be time to sit in the gutter when you get back to Gloucester."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301027"><said direct="false">Dodo also did her duty by Mr. Spencer. She called him Algernon in the friendliest way, and gave him several lessons at billiards. This done, she turned to Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301028"><said direct="false">The three had been there several days, and Dodo was getting impatient. Jack and Chesterford went out shooting, and she was left to entertain the other two. Mr. Spencer's reluctance to shoot was attributable not so much to his aversion to killing live animals, as his inability to slay. But when Dodo urged on him that he would soon learn, he claimed the higher motive. She was rather silent, for she was thinking about something important.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301029"><said direct="false">Dodo was surprised at the eagerness with which she looked forward to Jack's coming. Somehow, in a dim kind of way, she regarded him as the solution of her difficulties. She felt pretty certain Jack would do as he was asked, and she had made up her mind that when Jack went away she would go with him to see friends at other houses to which he was going. And Chesterford? Dodo's scheme did not seem to take in Chesterford. She had painted a charming little picture in her own mind as to where she should go, and whom she would see, but she certainly was aware that Chesterford did not seem to come in. It would spoil the composition, she thought, to introduce another figure. That would be a respite, anyhow. But after that, what then? Dodo had found it bad enough coming back this September, and she could not contemplate renewing this tête-à-tête that went on for months. And by degrees another picture took its place—a dim one, for the details were not worked out—but in that picture there were only two figures. The days went on and Dodo could bear it no longer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301030"><said direct="false">One evening she went into the smoking-room after tea. Chesterford was writing letters, and Maud and her husband were sitting in the drawing-room. It may be presumed that Maud was doing crochet. Jack looked up with a smile as Dodo entered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301031"><said direct="true">"Hurrah,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "I haven't had a word with you since we came. Come and talk, Dodo."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301032"><said direct="false">But Dodo did not smile.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301033"><said direct="true">"How have you been getting on?"</said><said direct="false"> continued Jack, looking at the fire. "You see I haven't lost my interest in you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301034"><said direct="true">"Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo solemnly, "you are right, and I was wrong. And I can't bear it any longer."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301035"><said direct="false">Jack did not need explanations.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301036"><said direct="true">"Ah!"</said><said direct="false">—then after a moment, "poor Chesterford!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301037"><said direct="true">"I don't see why 'poor Chesterford,'"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "any more than 'poor me.' He was quite satisfied, anyhow, for some months, for a year in fact, more or less, and I was never satisfied at all. I haven't got a particle of pride left in me, or else I shouldn't be telling you. I can't bear it. If you only knew what I have been through you would pity me as well. It has been a continual effort with me; surely that is something to pity. And one day I broke down; I forget when, it is immaterial. Oh, why couldn't I love him! I thought I was going to, and it was all a wretched mistake."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301038"><said direct="false">Dodo sat with her hands clasped before her, with something like tears in her eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301039"><said direct="true">"I am not all selfish,"</said><said direct="false"> she went on; "I am sorry for him, too, but I am so annoyed with him that I lose my sorrow whenever I see him. Why couldn't he have accepted the position sooner? We might have been excellent friends then, but now that is impossible. I have got past that. I cannot even be good friends with him. Oh, it isn't my fault; you know I tried to behave well."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301040"><said direct="false">Jack felt intensely uncomfortable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301041"><said direct="true">"I can't help you, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "It is useless for me to say I am sincerely sorry. That is no word between you and me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301042"><said direct="false">Dodo, for once in her life, seemed to have something to say, and not be able to say it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301043"><said direct="false">At last it came out with an effort.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301044"><said direct="true">"Jack, do you still love me?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301045"><said direct="false">Dodo did not look at him, but kept her eyes on the fire.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301046"><said direct="false">Jack did not pause to think.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301047"><said direct="true">"Before God, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false">, he said, "I believe I love you more than anything in the world."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301048"><said direct="true">"Will you do what I ask you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301049"><said direct="false">This time he did pause. He got up and stood before the fire. Still Dodo did not look at him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301050"><said direct="true">"Ah, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "what are you going to ask? There are some things I cannot do."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301051"><said direct="true">"It seems to me this love you talk of is a very weak thing,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "It always fails, or is in danger of failing, at the critical point. I believe I could do anything for the man I loved. I did not think so once. But I was wrong, as I have been in my marriage."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301052"><said direct="false">Dodo paused; but Jack said nothing; it seemed to him as if Dodo had not quite finished.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301053"><said direct="true">"Yes,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; then paused again. "Yes, you are he."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301054"><said direct="false">There was a dead silence. For one moment time seemed to Jack to have stopped, and he could have believed that that moment lasted for years—for ever.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301055"><said direct="true">"Oh, my God,"</said><said direct="false"> he murmured, "at last."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301056"><said direct="false">He was conscious of Dodo sitting there, with her eyes raised to his, and a smile on her lips. He felt himself bending forward towards her, and he thought she half rose in her chair to receive his embrace.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301057"><said direct="false">But the next moment she put out her hand as if to stop him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301058"><said direct="true">"Stay,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Not yet, not yet. There is something first. I will tell you what I have done. I counted on this. I have ordered the carriage after dinner at half-past ten. You and I go in that, and leave by the train. Jack, I am yours—will you come?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301059"><said direct="false">Dodo had taken the plunge. She had been wavering on the brink of this for days. It had struck her suddenly that afternoon that Jack was going away next day, and she was aware she could not contemplate the indefinite to-morrow and to-morrow without him. Like all Dodo's actions it came suddenly. The forces in her which had been drawing her on to this had gathered strength and sureness imperceptibly, and this evening they had suddenly burst through the very flimsy dam that Dodo had erected between the things she might do, and the things she might not, and their possession was complete. In a way it was inevitable. Dodo felt that her life was impossible. Chesterford, with infinite yearning and hunger at his heart, perhaps felt it too.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301060"><said direct="false">Jack felt as if he was waking out of some blissful dream to a return of his ordinary everyday life, which, unfortunately, had certain moral obligations attached to it. If Dodo's speech had been shorter, the result might have been different. He steadied himself for a moment, for the room seemed to reel and swim, and then he answered her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301061"><said direct="true">"No, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said hoarsely, "I cannot do it. Think of Chesterford! Think of anything! Don't tempt me. You know I cannot. How dare you ask me?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301062"><said direct="false">Dodo's face grew hard and white. She tried to laugh, but could not manage it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301063"><said direct="true">"Ah,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "the old story, isn't it? Potiphar's wife again. I really do not understand what this love of yours is. And now I have debased and humbled myself before you, and there you stand in your immaculate virtue, not caring—"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301064"><said direct="true">"Don't, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> He said. "Be merciful to me, spare me. Not caring—you know it is not so. But I cannot do this. My Dodo, my darling."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301065"><said direct="false">The strain was too great for him. He knelt down beside her, and kissed her hand passionately.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301066"><said direct="true">"I will do anything for you,"</said><said direct="false"> he whispered, "that is in my power to do; but this is impossible. I never yet did, with deliberate forethought, what seemed to me mean or low, and I can't now. I don't want credit for it, because I was made that way; I don't happen to be a blackguard by nature. Don't tempt me—I am too weak. But you mustn't blame me for it. You know—you must know that I love you. I left England last autumn to cure myself of it, but it didn't answer a bit. I don't ask more than what you have just told me. That is something—isn't it, Dodo? And, if you love me, that is something for you. Don't let us degrade it, let it be a strength to us and not a weakness. You must feel it so."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301067"><said direct="false">There was a long silence, and in that silence the great drama of love and life; and good and evil, which has been played every day of every year since the beginning of this world, and which will never cease till all mankind are saints or sexless, filled the stage. Dodo thought, at any rate, that she loved him, and that knowledge made her feel less abased before him. All love—the love for children, for parents, for husband, for wife, for lover, for mistress—has something divine about it, or else it is not love. The love Jack felt for her was divine enough not to seek its own, to sacrifice itself on the altar of duty and loyalty and the pure cold gods, and in its tumultuous happiness it could think of others. And Dodo's love was touched, though ever so faintly, with the same divine spark, a something so human that it touched heaven.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301068"><said direct="false">Now it had so happened that, exactly three minutes before this, Maud had found that she had left a particularly precious skein of wool in another room. About ten seconds' reflection made her remember she had left it in the smoking-room, where she had sat with Dodo after lunch, who had smoked cigarettes, and lectured her on her appearance. The smoking-room had two doors, about eight yards apart, forming a little passage lighted with a skylight. The first of those doors was of wood, the second, which led into the smoking-room, of baize. The first door was opened in the ordinary manner, the second with a silent push. Maud had made this silent push at the moment when Jack was kneeling by Dodo's side, kissing her hand. Maud was not versed in the wickedness of this present world, but she realised that this was a peculiar thing for Jack to do, and she let the door swing quietly back, and ran downstairs, intending to ask her husband's advice. Chesterford's study opened into the drawing-room. During the time that Maud had been upstairs he had gone in to fetch Dodo, and seeing she was not there he went back, but did not close the door behind him. A moment afterwards Maud rushed into the drawing-room from the hall, and carefully shutting the door behind her, lest anyone should hear, exclaimed:—</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG189301079"><said direct="true">"We must make the best of it, Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "and you must help me. I cannot trust myself any longer. I used to be so sure of myself, so convinced that I could be happy. I blame myself for it, not him; but then, you see, I can't get rid of myself, and I can of him. Hence this plan. I have been a fool and a beast. And he, you know, he is the best of men. Poor, dear old boy. It isn't his fault, but it isn't mine. I should like to know who profits by this absurd arrangement. Why can't I love him? Why can't I even like him? Why can't I help hating him? Yes, Jack, it has come to that. God knows there is no one more sorry than I am about it. But this is only a mood. I daresay in half an hour's time I shall only feel angry with him, and not sorry at all. I wonder if this match was made in heaven. Oh, I am miserable."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301080"><said direct="false">Jack was really to be pitied more than Dodo. He knelt by her with her hand in his, feeling that he would have given his life without question to make her happy, but knowing that he had better give his life than do so. The struggle itself was over. He felt like a chain being pulled in opposite directions. He did not wrestle any longer; the two forces, he thought, were simply fighting it out over his rigid body. He wondered vaguely whether something would break, and, if so, what? But he did not dream for a moment of ever reconsidering his answer to Dodo. The question did not even present itself. So he knelt by her, still holding her hand, and waiting for her to speak again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301081"><said direct="true">"You mustn't desert me, Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> Dodo went on. "It is easier for Chesterford, as well as for me, that you should be with us often, and I believe it is easier for you too. If I never saw you at all, I believe the crash would come. I should leave Chesterford, not to come to you, for that can't be, but simply to get away."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301082"><said direct="true">"Ah, don't,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, "don't go on talking about it like that. I can't do what you asked, you know that, simply because I love you and am Chesterford's friend. Think of your duty to him. Think, yes, think of our love for each other. Let it be something sacred, Dodo. Don't desecrate it. Help me not to desecrate it. Let it be our safeguard. It is better to have that, isn't it? than to think of going on living, as you must, without it. You said so yourself when you asked me to be with you often. To-night a deep joy has come into my life; let us keep it from disgrace. Ah, Dodo, thank God you love me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301083"><said direct="true">"Yes, Jack, I believe I do,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "And you are right; I always knew I should rise to the occasion if it was put forcibly before me. I believe I have an ideal—which I have never had before—something to respect and to keep very clean. Fancy me with an ideal! Mother wouldn't know me again—there never was such a thing in the house."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301084"><said direct="false">They were silent for a few minutes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301085"><said direct="true">"But I must go to-morrow,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, "as I settled to, by the disgusting early train. And the dressing-bell has sounded, and the ideal inexorably forbids us to be late for dinner, so I sha'n't see you alone again."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301086"><said direct="false">He pressed her hand and she rose..</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301087"><said direct="true">"Poor little ideal,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I suppose it would endanger its life if you stopped, wouldn't it, Jack? It must live to grow up. Poor little ideal, what a hell of a time it will have when you're gone. Poor dear."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301088"><said direct="false">Dinner went off as usual. Dodo seemed to be in her ordinary, spirits. Chesterford discussed parochial help with Mrs. Vivian. He glanced at Dodo occasionally through the little grove of orchids that separated them, but Dodo did not seem to notice. She ate a remarkably good dinner, and talked nonsense to Mr. Spencer who sat next her, and showed him how to construct a sea-sick passenger out of an orange, and smoked two cigarettes after the servants had left the room. Maud alone was ill at ease. She glanced apprehensively at Jack, as if she expected him to begin kissing Dodo's hand again, and, when he asked her casually where she had been since tea, she answered; "In the smoking-room—I mean the drawing-room." Jack merely raised his eyebrows, and remarked that he had been there himself, and did not remember seeing her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301089"><said direct="false">In the drawing-room again Dodo was in the best spirits. She gave Mr. Spencer lessons as to how to whistle on his fingers, and sang a French song in a brilliant and somewhat broad manner. The ladies soon retired, as there was a meet early on the following morning, and, after they had gone, Jack went up to the smoking-room, leaving Chesterford to finish a letter in his study. Shortly afterwards the latter heard the sound of wheels outside, and a footman entered to tell him the carriage was ready.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301090"><said direct="false">Chesterford was writing when the man entered, and did not look up.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301091"><said direct="true">"I did not order the carriage,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301092"><said direct="true">"Her ladyship ordered it for half-past ten,"</said><said direct="false"> said the man. "She gave the order to me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301093"><said direct="false">Still Lord Chesterford did not look up, and sat silent so long that the man spoke again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301094"><said direct="true">"Shall I tell her ladyship it is round?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked. "I came to your lordship, as I understood her ladyship had gone upstairs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301095"><said direct="true">"You did quite right,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "There has been a mistake; it will not be wanted. Don't disturb Lady Chesterford, or mention it to her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301096"><said direct="true">"Very good, my lord."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301097"><said direct="false">He turned to leave the room, when Lord Chesterford stopped him again. He spoke slowly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301098"><said direct="true">"Did Lady Chesterford give you any other orders?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301099"><said direct="true">"She told me to see that Mr. Broxton's things were packed, my lord, as he would go away to-night. But she told me just before dinner that he wouldn't leave till the morning."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301100"><said direct="true">"Thanks,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lord Chesterford. "That's all, I think. When is Mr. Broxton leaving?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301101"><said direct="true">"By the early train to-morrow, my lord."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301102"><said direct="true">"Go up to the smoking-room and ask him to be so good as to come here a minute."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301103"><said direct="false">The man left the room, and gave his message. Jack wondered a little, but went down.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301104"><said direct="false">Lord Chesterford was standing with his back to the fire. He looked up when Jack entered. He seemed to find some difficulty in speaking.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301105"><said direct="true">"Jack, old boy,"</said><said direct="false"> he said at last, "you and I have been friends a long time, and you will not mind my being frank. Can you honestly say that you are still a friend of mine?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301106"><said direct="false">Jack advanced towards him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301107"><said direct="true">"I thank God that I can,"</said><said direct="false"> he said simply, and held out his hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301108"><said direct="false">He spoke without reflecting, for he did not know how much Chesterford knew. Of course, up to this moment, he had not been aware that he knew anything. But Chesterford's tone convinced him. But a moment afterwards he saw that he had made a mistake, and he hastened to correct it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301109"><said direct="true">"I spoke at random,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "though I swear that what I said was true. I do not know on what grounds you put the question to me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301110"><said direct="false">Lord Chesterford did not seem to be attending.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301111"><said direct="true">"But it was true?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301112"><said direct="false">Jack felt in a horrible mess. If he attempted to explain, it would necessitate letting Chesterford know the whole business. He chose between the two evils, for he would not betray Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301113"><said direct="true">"Yes, it is true,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301114"><said direct="false">Chesterford shook his hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301115"><said direct="true">"Forgive me for asking you, Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Then that's done with. But there is something more, something which it is hard for me to say." He paused, and Jack noticed that he was crumpling a piece of paper he held in his hand into a tight hard ball. "Then—then Dodo is tired of me?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301116"><said direct="false">Jack felt helpless and sick. He could not trust himself to speak.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301117"><said direct="true">"Isn't it so?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Chesterford again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301118"><said direct="false">Jack for reply held out both his hands without speaking. There was something horrible in the sight of this strong man standing pale and trembling before him. In a moment Chesterford turned away, and stood warming his hands at the fire.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301119"><said direct="true">"I heard something I wasn't meant to hear,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "and I know as much as I wish to. It doesn't much matter exactly what has happened. You have told me you are still my friend, and I thank you for it. And Dodo—Dodo is tired of me. I can reconstruct as much as is necessary. You are going off to-morrow, aren't you? I sha'n't see you again. Good-bye, Jack; try to forget I ever mistrusted you. I must ask you to leave me; I've got some things to think over."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301120"><said direct="false">But Jack still lingered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301121"><said direct="true">"Try to forgive Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "and forgive me for saying so, but don't be hard on her. It will only make things worse."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301122"><said direct="true">"Hard on her?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Chesterford. "Poor Dodo, it is hard on her enough without that. She shall never know that I know, if I can help. I am not going to tell you what I know either. If you feel wronged that I even asked you that question, I am sorry for it, but I had grounds, and I am not a jealous man. The whole thing has been an awful mistake. I knew it in July, but I shall not make it worse by telling Dodo."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301123"><said direct="false">Jack went out from his presence with a kind of awe. He did not care to know how Chesterford had found out, or how much. All other feelings were swallowed up in a vast pity for this poor man, whom no human aid could ever reach. The great fabric which his love had raised had been shattered hopelessly, and his love sat among its ruins and wept. It was all summed up in that short sentence, "Dodo is tired of me," and Jack knew that it was true. The whole business was hopeless. Dodo had betrayed him, and he knew it. He could no longer find a cold comfort in the thought that some day, if the difficult places could be tided over, she might grow to love him again. That was past. And yet he had only one thought, and that was for Dodo. "She shall never know I know it." Truly there is something divine in those men we thought most human.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301124"><said direct="false">Jack went to his room and thought it all over. He was horribly vexed with himself for having exculpated himself, but the point of Chesterford's question was quite clear, and there was only one answer to it. Chesterford obviously did mean to ask whether he had been guilty of the great act of disloyalty which Dodo had proposed, and on the whole he would reconstruct the story in his mind more faithfully than if he had answered anything else, or had refused to answer. But Jack very much doubted whether Chesterford would reconstruct the story at all. The details had evidently no interest for him. All that mattered was expressed in that one sentence, "Dodo is tired of me." Jack would have given his right hand to have been able to answer "No," or to have been able to warn Dodo; but he saw that there was nothing to be done. The smash had come, Chesterford had had a rude awakening. But his love was not dead, though it was stoned and beaten and outcast. With this in mind Jack took a sheet of paper from his writing-case, and wrote on it these words:—</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301125"><said direct="true">"Do not desecrate it; let it help you to make an effort."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301126"><said direct="false">He addressed it to Dodo, and when he went downstairs the next morning he slipped it among the letters that were waiting for her. The footman told him she had gone hunting.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301127"><said direct="true">"Is Lord Chesterford up yet?"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301128"><said direct="true">"Yes, sir; he went hunting too with her ladyship,"</said><said direct="false"> replied the man.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301129"><said direct="false">Dodo was called that morning at six, and she felt in very good spirits. There was something exhilarating in the thought of a good gallop again. There had been frost for a week before, and hunting had been stopped, but Dodo meant to make up all arrears. And, on the whole, her interview with Jack had consoled her, and it had given her quite a new feeling of duty. Dodo always liked new things, at any rate till the varnish had rubbed off, and she quite realised that Jack was making a sacrifice to the same forbidding goddess.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301130"><said direct="true">"Well, I will make a sacrifice, too,"</said><said direct="false"> she thought as she dressed, "and when I die I shall be St. Dodo. I don't think there ever was a saint Dodo before, or is it saintess? Anyhow, I am going to be very good. Jack really is right; it is the only thing to do. I should have felt horribly mean if I had gone off last night, and I daresay I should have had to go abroad, which would have been a nuisance. I wonder if Chesterford's coming. I shall make him, I think, and be very charming indeed. Westley, go and tap at the door of Lord Chesterford's room, and tell him he is coming hunting, and that I've ordered his horse, and send his man to him, and let us have breakfast at once for two instead of one."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301131"><said direct="false">Dodo arranged her hat and stood contemplating her own figure at a cheval glass. It really did make a charming picture, and Dodo gave two little steps on one side, holding her skirt up in her left hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301132"><said direct="false">she hummed to herself. "Hurrah for a gallop."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301133"><said direct="false">She ran downstairs and made tea, and began breakfast. A moment afterwards she heard steps in the hall, and Chesterford entered. Dodo was not conscious of the least embarrassment, and determined to do her duty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301134"><said direct="true">"Morning, old boy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "you look as sleepy as a d. p. or dead pig. Look at my hat. It's a new hat, Chesterford, and is the joy of my heart. Isn't it sweet? Have some tea, and give me another kidney —two, I think. What happens to the sheep after they take its kidneys out? Do you suppose it dies? I wonder if they put india-rubber kidneys in. Kidneys do come from sheep, don't they? Or is there a kidney tree? Kidneys look like a sort of mushroom, and I suppose the bacon is the leaves, Kidnonia Baconiensis; now you're doing Latin, Chesterford, as you used to at Eton. I daresay you've forgotten what the Latin for kidneys is. I should like to have seen you at Eton, Chesterford. You must have been such a dear, chubby boy with blue eyes. You've got rather good eyes. I think I shall paint mine blue, and we shall have a nice little paragraph in the Sportsman. Extraordinary example of conjugal devotion. The beautiful and fascinating Lady C. (you know I am beautiful and fascinating, that's why you married me), the wife of the charming and manly Lord C. (you know you are charming and manly, or I shouldn't have married you, and where would you have been then? like Methusaleh when the candle went out), who lived not a hundred miles from the ancient city of Harchester,' etc. Now it's your turn to say something, I can't carry on a conversation alone. Besides, I've finished breakfast, and I shall sit by you and feed you. Don't take such large mouthfuls. That was nearly a whole kidney you put in then. You'll die of kidneys, and then people will think you had something wrong with your inside, but I shall put on your tombstone, 'Because he ate them, two at a time.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301135"><said direct="false">Chesterford laughed. Dodo had not behaved like this for months. What did it all mean? But the events of the night before were too deeply branded on his memory to let him comfort himself very much. But anyhow it was charming to see Dodo like this again. And she shall never know.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301136"><said direct="true">"You'll choke if you laugh with five kidneys in your mouth,"</said><said direct="false"> Dodo went on. "They'll get down into your lungs and bob about, and all your organs will get mixed up together, and you won't be able to play on them. I suppose Americans have American organs in their insides, which accounts for their squeaky voices. Now, have you finished? Oh, you really can't have any marmalade; put it in your pocket and eat it as you go along."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301137"><said direct="false">Dodo was surprised at the ease with which she could talk nonsense again. She abused herself for ever having let it drop. It really was much better than yawning and being bored. She had no idea how entertaining she was to herself. And Chesterford had lost his hang-dog look. He put her hat straight for her, and gave her a little kiss just as he used to. After all, things were not so bad.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301138"><said direct="false">It was a perfect morning. They left the house about a quarter to seven, and the world was beginning to wake again. There was a slight hoar-frost on the blades of grass that lined the road, and on the sprigs of bare hawthorn. In the east the sky was red with the coming day. Dodo sniffed the cool morning air with a sense of great satisfaction.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301139"><said direct="true">"Decidedly somebody washes the world every night,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "and those are the soapsuds which are still clinging to the grass. What nice clean soap, all in little white crystals and spikes. And oh, how good it smells! Look at those poor little devils of birds looking for their breakfast. Poor dears, I suppose they'll be dead when the spring comes. There are the hounds. Come on, Chesterford, they're just going to draw the far cover. It is a sensible plan beginning hunting by seven. You get five hours by lunch-time."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301140"><said direct="false">None of Dodo's worst enemies accused her of riding badly. She had a perfect seat, and that mysterious communication with her horse that seems nothing short of magical. "If you tell your horse to do a thing the right way," she used to say, "he does it. It is inevitable. The question is, 'Who is master?' as Humpty Dumpty said. But it isn't only master; you must make him enjoy it. You must make him feel friendly as well, or else he'll go over the fence right enough, but buck you off on the other side, as a kind of protest, and quite right too."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301141"><said direct="false">Dodo had a most enjoyable day's hunting, and returned home well pleased with herself and everybody else. She found Jack's note waiting for her. She read it thoughtfully, and said to herself, "He is quite right, and that is what I mean to do. My young ideal, I am teaching you how to shoot."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301142"><said direct="false">She took up a pen, meaning to write to him, but laid it down again. "No," she said, "I can do without that at present. I will keep that for my bad days. I suppose the bad days will come, and I won't use my remedies before I get the disease."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301143"><said direct="false">The days passed on. They went hunting every morning, and Dodo began to form very high hopes of her new child, as she called her ideal. The bad days did not seem to be the least imminent. Chesterford behaved almost like a lover again in the light of Dodo's new smiles. He kept his bad times to himself. They came in the evening usually when the others had gone to bed. He used to sit up late by himself over his study fire, thinking hopelessly, of the day that had gone and the day that was to come. It was a constant struggle not to tell Dodo all he knew. He could scarcely believe that he had heard what Maud had said, or that he ever had had that interview with Jack. He could not reconcile these things with Dodo's altered behaviour, and he gave it up. Dodo was tired of him, and he knew that he loved her more than ever. A more delicately-strung mind might almost have given way under the hourly struggle, but it is the fate of a healthy simple man to be capable of more continued suffering than one more highly developed. The latter breaks down, or he gets numbed with the pain; but Chesterford went on living under the slow ache, and his suffering grew no less. But through it all he looked back with deep gratitude to the chance that had sent Dodo in his way. He did not grow bitter, and realised in the midst of his suffering how happy he had been. He had only one strong wish. "Oh, God," he cried, "give me her back for one moment! Let her be sorry just once for my sake."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301144"><said direct="false">But there is a limit set to human misery, and the end had nearly come.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301145"><said direct="false">It was about a fortnight after Jack had gone. Maud and Mr. Spencer had gone too, but Mrs. Vivian was with them still. Dodo had more than once thought of telling her what had happened, but she could not manage it. When Mrs. Vivian had spoken of going, Dodo entreated her to stop, for she had a great fear of being left alone with Chesterford.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301146"><said direct="false">They had been out hunting, and Dodo had got home first. It was about three in the afternoon, and it had begun to snow. She had had lunch, and was sitting in the morning-room in a drowsy frame of mind. She was wondering whether Chesterford had returned, and whether he would come up and see her, and whether she was not too lazy to exert herself. She heard a carriage come slowly up the drive, and did not feel interested enough to look out of the window. She was sitting with her shoes off warming her feet at the fire, with a novel in her lap, which she was not reading, and a cigarette in her hand. She heard the opening and shutting of doors, and slow steps on the stairs. Then the door opened and Mrs. Vivian came in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301147"><said direct="false">Dodo had seen that look in her face once before, when she was riding in the Park with Jack, and a fearful certainty came upon her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301148"><said direct="false">She got up and turned towards her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301149"><said direct="true">"Is he dead?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301150"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian drew her back into her seat.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301151"><said direct="true">"I will tell you all,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "He has had a dangerous fall hunting, and it is very serious. The doctors are with him. There is some internal injury, and he is to have an operation. It is the only chance of saving his life, and even then it is a very slender one. He is quite conscious, and asked me to tell you. You will not be able to see him for half an hour. The operation is going on now."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301152"><said direct="false">Dodo sat perfectly still. She did not speak a word; she scarcely even thought anything. Everything seemed to be a horrible blank to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301153"><said direct="true">"Ah God, ah God!"</said><said direct="false"> she burst out at last. "Can't I do anything to help? I would give my right hand to help him. It is all too horrible. To think that I—" She walked up and down the room, and then suddenly opened the door and went downstairs. She paced up and down the drawing-room, paused a moment, and went into his study. His papers were lying about in confusion on the table, but on the top was a guide-book to the Riviera. Dodo remembered his buying this at Mentone on their wedding-tour, and conscientiously walking about the town sight-seeing. She sat down in his chair and took it up. She remembered also that he had bought her that day a new volume of poems which had just come out, and had read to her out of it. There was in it a poem called "Paris and Helen." He had read that among others, and had said to her, as they were being rowed back to the yacht again that evening, "That is you and I, Dodo, going home."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301154"><said direct="false">On the fly-leaf of the guide-book he had written it out, and, as she sat there now, Dodo read it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301155"><said direct="false">Dodo buried her face in her hands with a low cry. "I have been cruel and wicked," she sobbed to herself. "I have despised the best that any man could ever give me, and I can never make him amends. I will tell him all. I will ask him to forgive me. Oh, poor Chesterford, poor Chesterford!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301156"><said direct="false">She sat there sobbing in complete misery. She saw, as she had never seen before, the greatness of his love for her, and her wretched, miserable return for his gift.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301157"><said direct="true">"It is all over; I know he will die,"</said><said direct="false"> she sobbed. "Supposing he does not know me—supposing he dies before I can tell him. Oh, my husband, my husband, live to forgive me!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301158"><said direct="false">She was roused by a touch on her shoulder. Mrs. Vivian stood by her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301159"><said direct="true">"You must be quick, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "There is not much time."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301160"><said direct="false">Dodo did not answer her, but went upstairs. Before the bedroom door she stopped.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301161"><said direct="true">"I must speak to him alone,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Send them all out."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301162"><said direct="true">"They have gone into the dressing-room,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vivian; "he is alone."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301163"><said direct="false">Dodo stayed no longer, but went in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301164"><said direct="false">He was lying facing the door, and the shadow of death was on his face. But he recognised Dodo, and smiled and held out his hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301165"><said direct="false">Dodo ran to the bedside and knelt by it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301166"><said direct="true">"Oh, Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> she sobbed, "I have wronged you cruelly, and I can never make it up. I will tell you all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301167"><said direct="true">"There is no need,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "I knew it all along."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301168"><said direct="false">Dodo raised her head. "You knew it all?" she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301169"><said direct="true">"Yes, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "it was by accident that I knew it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301170"><said direct="true">"And you behaved to me as usual,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301171"><said direct="true">"Yes, my darling,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "you wouldn't have had me beat you, would you? Don't speak of it—there is not much time."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301172"><said direct="true">"Ah, forgive me, forgive me!"</said><said direct="false"> she cried. "How could I have done it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301173"><said direct="true">"It was not a case of forgiving,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "You are you, you are Dodo. My darling, there is not time to say much. You have been very good to me, and have given me more happiness than I ever thought I could have had."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301174"><said direct="true">"Chesterford! Chesterford!"</said><said direct="false"> cried Dodo pleadingly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301175"><said direct="true">"Yes, darling,"</said><said direct="false"> he answered; "my own wife. Dodo, I shall see the boy soon, and we will wait for you together. You will be mine again then. There shall be no more parting."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301176"><said direct="false">Dodo could not answer him. She could only press his hand and kiss his lips, which were growing very white.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301177"><said direct="false">It was becoming a fearful effort for him to speak. The words came slowly with long pauses.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301178"><said direct="true">"There is one more thing,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "You must marry Jack. You must make him very happy—as you have made me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301179"><said direct="true">"Ah, don't say that,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo brokenly; "don't cut me to the heart."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301180"><said direct="true">"My darling,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "my sweet own wife, I am so glad you told me. It has cleared up the only cloud. I wondered whether you would tell me. I prayed God you might, and He has granted it me. Good-bye, my own darling, good-bye."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301181"><said direct="false">Dodo lay in his arms, and kissed him passionately.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301182"><said direct="true">"Good-bye, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> she sobbed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301183"><said direct="false">He half raised himself in bed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301184"><said direct="true">"Ah, my Dodo, my sweet wife,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301185"><said direct="false">Then he fell back and lay very still.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301186"><said direct="false">How long Dodo remained there she did not know. She remembered Mrs. Vivian coming in and raising her gently, and they left the darkened room together.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301187"><said direct="false">Picture to yourself, or let me try to picture for you, a long, low, rambling house, covering a quite unnecessary area of ground, with many gables, tall, red-brick chimneys, unexpected corners, and little bow windows looking out from narrow turrets-a house that looks as if it had grown, rather than been designed and built. It began obviously with that little grey stone section, which seems to consist of small rooms with mullion windows, over which the ivy has asserted so supreme a dominion. The next occupant had been a man who knew how to make himself comfortable, but did not care in the least what sort of appearance his additions would wear to the world at large; to him we may assign that uncompromising straight wing which projects to the right of the little core of grey stone. Then came a series of attempts to screen the puritanical ugliness of the offending block. Some one ran up two little turrets at one end, and a clock tower in the middle; one side of it was made the main entrance of the house, and two red-tiled lines of building were built at right angles to it to form a three-sided quadrangle, and the carriage drive was brought up in a wide sweep to the door, and a sun-dial was planted down in the grass plot in the middle, in such a way that the sun could only peep at it for an hour or two every day, owing to the line of building which sheltered it on every side except the north. So the old house went on growing, and got more incongruous and more delightful with every addition.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301188"><said direct="false">The garden has had to take care of itself under such circumstances, and if the house has been pushing it back in one place, it has wormed itself in at another, and queer little lawns with flower beds of old-fashioned, sweet-smelling plants have crept in where you least expect them. This particular garden has always seemed to me the ideal of what a garden should be. It is made to sit in, to smoke in, to think in, to do nothing in. A wavy, irregular lawn forbids the possibility of tennis, or any game that implies exertion or skill, and it is the home of sweet smells, bright colour, and chuckling birds. There are long borders of mignonette, wallflowers and hollyhocks, and many old-fashioned flowers, which are going the way of all old fashions. London pride, with its delicate spirals and star-like blossoms, and the red drooping velvet of love-lies-a-bleeding. The thump of tennis balls, the flying horrors of ring-goal, even the clash of croquet is tabooed in this sacred spot. Down below, indeed, beyond that thick privet hedge, you may find, if you wish, a smooth, well-kept piece of grass, where, even now—if we may judge from white figures that cross the little square, where a swinging iron gate seems to remonstrate hastily and ill-temperedly with those who leave these reflective shades for the glare and publicity of tennis—a game seems to be in progress. If you had exploring tendencies in your nature, and had happened to find yourself, on the afternoon of which I propose to speak, in this delightful garden, you would sooner or later have wandered into a low-lying grassy basin, shut in on three sides by banks of bushy rose-trees. The faint, delicate smell of their pale fragrance would have led you there, or, perhaps, the light trickling of a fountain, now nearly summer dry. Perhaps the exploring tendency would account for your discovery. There, lying back in a basket-chair, with a half-read letter in her hand, and an accusing tennis racquet by her side, you would have found Edith Staines. She had waited after lunch to get her letters, and going out, meaning to join the others, she had found something among them that interested her, and she was reading a certain letter through a second time when you broke in upon her. After a few minutes she folded it up, put it back in the envelope, and sat still, thinking. "So she's going to marry him," she said half aloud, and she took up her racquet and went down to the tennis courts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301189"><said direct="false">Ten days ago she had come down to stay with Miss Grantham, at the end of the London season. Miss Grantham's father was a somewhat florid baronet of fifty years of age. He had six feet of height, a cheerful, high-coloured face, and a moustache, which he was just conscious had military suggestions about it—though he had never been in the army—which was beginning to grow grey. His wife had been a lovely woman, half Spanish by birth, with that peculiarly crisp pronunciation that English people so seldom possess, and which is almost as charming to hear as a child's first conscious grasp of new words. She dressed remarkably well; her reading chiefly consisted of the Morning Post, French novels, and small books of morbid poetry, which seemed to her very chic, and she was worldly to the tips of her delicate fingers. She had no accomplishments of any sort, except a great knowledge of foreign languages. She argued, with much reason, that you could get other people to do your accomplishments for you. "Why should I worry myself with playing scales?" she said. "I can hire some poor wretch" (she never could quite manage the English "r") "to play to me by the hour. He will play much better than I ever should, and it is a form of charity as well."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301190"><said direct="false">Edith had made great friends with her, and disagreed with her on every topic under the sun. Lady Grantham admired Edith's vivacity, though her own line was serene elegance, and respected her success. Success was the one accomplishment that she really looked up to (partly, perhaps, because she felt she had such a large measure of it herself), and no one could deny that Edith was successful. She had enough broadness of view to admire success in any line, and would have had a vague sense of satisfaction in accepting the arm of; the best crossing-sweeper in London to take her in to dinner. She lived in a leonine atmosphere, and if you did not happen to meet a particular lion at her house, it was because "he was here on Monday, or is coming on Wednesday"; at any rate, not because he had not been asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301191"><said direct="false">Edith, however, felt thoroughly pleased with her quarters. She had hinted once that she had to go the day after to-morrow, but Nora Grantham had declined to argue the question. "You're only going home to do your music," she said. "We've got quite as good a piano here as you have, and, we leave you entirely to your own devices. Besides, you're mother's lion just now—isn't she, mother?—and you're not going to get out of the menagerie just yet. There is going to be a big feeding-time next week, and you will have to roar." Edith's remark about the necessity of going had been dictated only by a sense of duty, in order to give her hosts an opportunity of getting rid of her if they wished, and she was quite content to stop. She strolled down across the lawn to the tennis courts in a thoughtful frame of mind, and met Miss Grantham, who was coming to look for her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301192"><said direct="true">"Where have you been, Edith?"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "They're all clamouring for you. Mother is sitting in the summer-house wondering why anybody wants to play tennis. She says none of them will ever be as good as Cracklin, and he's a cad."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301193"><said direct="true">"Grantie,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith, "Dodo's engaged."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301194"><said direct="true">"Oh, dear, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I knew she would be. How delightful. Jack's got his reward at last. May I tell everyone? How funny that she should marry a Lord Chesterford twice. It was so convenient that the first one shouldn't have had any brothers, and Dodo won't have to change her visiting cards; or have new handkerchiefs or anything. What a contrast, though!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301195"><said direct="true">"No, it's private at present,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Dodo has just written to me; she told me I might tell you. Do you altogether like it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301196"><said direct="true">"Of course I do,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "Only I should like to marry Jack myself. I wonder if he asked Dodo, or if Dodo asked him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301197"><said direct="true">"I suppose it was inevitable,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Dodo says that Chesterford's last words to her were that she should marry Jack."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301198"><said direct="true">"That was so sweet of him,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured Miss Grantham. "He was very sweet and dear and remembering, wasn't he?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301199"><said direct="false">Edith was still grave and doubtful.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301200"><said direct="true">"I'm sure there was nearly a crash,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Do you remember the Brettons' ball? Chesterford didn't like that, and they quarrelled, I know, next morning."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301201"><said direct="true">"Oh, how interesting,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "But Dodo was quite right to go, I think. She was dreadfully bored, and she will not stand being bored. She might have done something much worse."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301202"><said direct="true">"It seems to be imperatively necessary for Dodo to do something unexpected,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "I wonder, oh, I wonder—Jack will be very happy for a time," she added inconsequently.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301203"><said direct="false">Edith's coming was the signal for serious play to begin. She entirely declined to play except with people who considered it, for the time being, the most important thing in the world, and naturally she played well.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301204"><said direct="false">A young man, of military appearance on a small scale, was sitting by Lady Grantham in the tent, and entertaining her with somewhat unfledged remarks.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301205"><said direct="true">"Miss Staines does play so arfly well, doesn't she?"</said><said direct="false"> he was saying. "Look at that stroke, perfectly rippin' you know, what?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301206"><said direct="false">Mr. Featherstone had a habit of finishing all his sentences with "what?" He pronounced it to rhyme with heart.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301207"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham was reading Loti's book of pity and death. It answered the double purpose of being French and morbid.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301208"><said direct="true">"What book have you got hold of there?"</said><said direct="false"> continued Featherstone. "It's an awful bore reading books, dontcherthink, what? I wish one could get a feller to read them for me, and then tell one about them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301209"><said direct="true">"I rather enjoy some books,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. "This, for instance, is a good one," and she held the book towards him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301210"><said direct="true">"Oh, that's French, isn't it?"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Featherstone. "I did French at school; don't know a word now. It's an arful bore having to learn French, isn't it? Couldn't I get a feller to learn it for me?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301211"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham reflected.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301212"><said direct="true">"I daresay you could,"</said><said direct="false"> she replied. "You might get your man—tiger—how do you call him?—to learn it. It's capable of comprehension to the lowest intellect," she added crisply.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301213"><said direct="true">"Oh, come, Lady Grantham,"</said><said direct="false"> he replied, "you don't think so badly of me as that, do you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301214"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham was seized with a momentary desire to run her parasol through his body, provided it could be done languidly and without effort. Her daughter had come up, and sat down in a low chair by her. Featherstone was devoting the whole of his great mind to the end of his moustache.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301215"><said direct="true">"Nora,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, quietly, "this little man must be taken away. I can't quite manage him. Tell him to go and play about."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301216"><said direct="true">"Dear mother,"</said><said direct="false"> she replied, "bear him a little longer. He can't play about by himself."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301217"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham got gently up from her chair, and thrust an exquisite little silver paper-knife between the leaves of her book.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301218"><said direct="true">"I think I will ask you to take my chair across to that tree opposite,"</said><said direct="false"> she said to him, without looking at him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301219"><said direct="false">He followed her, dragging the chair after him. Halfway across the lawn they met a footman bringing tea down into the ground.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301220"><said direct="true">"Take the chair,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. Then she turned to her little man. "Many thanks. I won't detain you," she said, with a sweet smile. "So good of you to have come here this afternoon."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301221"><said direct="false">Featherstone was impenetrable. He lounged back, if so small a thing can be said to lounge, and sat down again by Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301222"><said direct="true">"Fascinatin' woman your mother is,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Arfly clever, isn't she? What? Knows French and that sort of thing. I can always get along all right in France. If you only swear at the waiters they understand what you want all right, you know."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301223"><said direct="false">Two or three other fresh arrivals made it possible for another set to be started, and Mr. Featherstone was induced to play, in spite of his protestations that he had quite given up tennis for polo. Lady Grantham finished her Loti, and moved back to the tea-table, where Edith was sitting, fanning herself with a cabbage leaf, and receiving homage on the score of her tennis-playing. Lady Grantham did not offer to give anybody any tea; she supposed they would take it when they wanted it, but she wished someone would give her a cup.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301224"><said direct="true">"What's the name of the little man and his moustache?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked Edith, indicating Mr. Featherstone, who was performing wild antics in the next court.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301225"><said direct="false">Edith informed her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301226"><said direct="true">"How did he get here?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Lady Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301227"><said direct="true">"Oh, he's a friend of mine. I think he came to see me,"</said><said direct="false"> replied Edith. "He lives somewhere about. I suppose you find him rather trying. It doesn't matter; he's of no consequence."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301228"><said direct="true">"My dear Edith, between your sporting curate, and your German conductor, and your Roman Catholic cure, and this man, one's life isn't safe."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301229"><said direct="true">"You won't see the good side of those sort of people,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "If they've got rather overwhelming manners, and aren't as silent and bored as you think young men ought to be, you think they're utter outsiders."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301230"><said direct="true">"I only want to know if there are any more of that sort going to turn up. Think of the positions you put me in! When I went into the drawing-room yesterday, for instance, before lunch, I find a Roman Catholic priest there, who puts up two fingers at me, and says 'Benedicite.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301231"><said direct="false">Edith lay back in her chair and laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301232"><said direct="true">"How I should like to have seen you! Did you think he was saying grace, or did you tell him not to be insolent?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301233"><said direct="true">"I behaved with admirable moderation,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. "I even prepared to be nice to him. But he had sudden misgivings, and said, 'I beg your pardon, I thought you were Miss Staines.' I saw I was not wanted, and retreated. That is not all. Bob told me that I had to take a curate in to dinner last night, and asked me not to frighten him. I suppose he thought I wanted to say 'Bo,' or howl at him. The curate tried me. I sat down when we got to the table, and he turned to me and said, 'I beg your pardon'—they all beg my pardon—'but I'm going to say grace.' Then I prepared myself to talk night schools and district visiting; but he turned on me, and asked what I thought of Orme's chances for the St. Leger."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301234"><said direct="true">"Oh, dear! oh, dear!"</said><said direct="false"> cried Edith; "he told me afterwards that you seemed a very serious lady."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301235"><said direct="true">"I didn't intend to encourage that,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Lady Grantham; "so I held on to district visiting. We shook our heads together over dissent in Wales. We split over Calvinism—who was Calvin? We renounced society; and I was going to work him a pair of slippers. We were very edifying. Then he sang comic songs in the drawing-room, and discussed the methods of cheating at baccarat. I was a dead failure."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301236"><said direct="true">"Anyhow, you're a serious lady,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301237"><said direct="true">"That young man will come to a bad end,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham; "so will your German conductor. He ordered beer in the middle of the morning, to-day—the second footman will certainly give notice—and he smoked a little clay pipe after dinner in the dining-room. Then this afternoon comes this other friend of yours. He says, 'Arfly rippin' what.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301238"><said direct="true">"He said you were arfly fascinatin' what,"</said><said direct="false"> interpolated Miss Grantham, "when you went away to read your book. You were very rude to him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301239"><said direct="false">Sir Robert Grantham had joined the party. He was a great hand at adapting his conversation to his audience, and making everyone conscious that they ought to feel quite at home. He recounted at some length a series of tennis matches which he had taken part in a few years ago. A strained elbow had spoiled his chances of winning, but the games were most exciting, and it was generally agreed at the time that the form of the players was quite first-class. He talked about Wagner and counterpoint to Edith. He asked his vicar abstruse questions on the evidence of the immortality of the soul after death; he discussed agriculture and farming with tenants, to whom he always said "thank ye," instead of "thank you," in order that they might feel quite at their ease; he lamented the want of physique in the English army to Mr. Featherstone, who was very short, and declared that the average height of Englishmen was only five feet four. As he said this he drew himself up, and made it quite obvious that he himself was six feet high, and broad in proportion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301240"><said direct="false">A few more cups of tea were drunk, and a few more sets played, and the party dispersed. Edith was the only guest in the house, and she and Frank, the Oxford son, stopped behind to play a game or two more before dinner. Lady Grantham and Nora strolled up through the garden towards the house, while Sir Robert remained on the ground, and mingled advice, criticism, and approbation to the tennis players; Frank's back-handed stroke, he thought, was not as good as it might be, and Edith could, certainly put half fifteen on to her game if judiciously coached. Neither of the players volleyed as well as himself, but volleying was his strong point, and they must not be discouraged. Frank's attitude to his father was that of undisguised amusement; but he found him very entertaining.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301241"><said direct="false">They were all rather late for dinner, and Lady Grantham was waiting for them in the drawing-room. Frank and his father were down before Edith, and Lady Grantham was making remarks on their personal appearance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301242"><said direct="true">"You look very, hot and red,"</said><said direct="false"> she was saying to her son, "and I really wish you would brush your hair better. I don't know what young men are coming to, they seem to think that everything is to be kept waiting for them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301243"><said direct="false">Frank's attitude was one of serene indifference.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301244"><said direct="true">"Go on, go on,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "I don't mind."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301245"><said direct="false">Edith was five minutes later. Lady Grantham remarked on the importance of being in time for dinner, and hoped they wouldn't all die from going to bed too soon afterwards. Frank apologised for his mother.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301246"><said direct="true">"Don't mind her, Miss Staines,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "they're only her foreign manners. She doesn't know how to behave. It's all right. I'm going to take you in, mother. Are we going to have grouse?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301247"><said direct="false">That evening Miss Grantham and Edith "talked Dodo," as the latter called it, till the small hours.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301248"><said direct="false">She produced Dodo's letter, and read extracts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301249"><said direct="true">"Of course, we sha'n't be married till after next November,"</said><said direct="false"> wrote Dodo. "Jack wouldn't hear of it, and it would seem very unfeeling. Don't you think so? It will be odd going back to Winston again. Mind you come and stay with us at Easter."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301250"><said direct="true">"I wonder if Dodo ever thinks with regret of anything or anybody,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Imagine writing like that—asking me if I shouldn't think it unfeeling."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301251"><said direct="true">"Oh, but she says she would think it unfeeling,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "That's so sweet and remembering of her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301252"><said direct="true">"But don't you see,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith, "she evidently thinks it is so good of her to have feelings about it at all. She might as well call attention to the fact that she always puts her shoes and stockings on to go to church."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301253"><said direct="true">"There's a lot of women who would marry again before a year was out if it wasn't for convention,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301254"><said direct="true">"That's probably the case with Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Edith. "Dodo doesn't care one pin for the memory of that man. She knows it, and she knows I know it. Why does she say that sort of thing to me? He was a good man, too, and I'm not sure that he wasn't great. Chesterford detested me, but I recognised him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301255"><said direct="true">"Oh, I don't think he was great,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "Didn't he always strike you as a little stupid?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301256"><said direct="true">"I prefer stupid people,"</said><said direct="false"> declared Edith roundly. "They are so restful. They're like nice; sweet, white bread; they quench your hunger as well as pâté de foie gras, and they are much better for you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301257"><said direct="true">"I think they make you just a little thirsty,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Miss Grantham. "I should have said they were more like cracknels. Besides, do you think that it's an advantage to associate with people who are good for you? It produces a sort of rabies in me. I want to bite them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301258"><said direct="true">"You like making yourself out worse than you are, Grantie,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301259"><said direct="true">"I think you like making Dodo out worse than she is,"</said><said direct="false"> returned Nora. "I always used to think you were very fond of her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301260"><said direct="true">"I am fond of her,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith; "that's why I'm dissatisfied with her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301261"><said direct="true">"What a curious way of showing your affection,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I love Dodo, and if I was a man I should like to many her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301262"><said direct="true">"Dodo is too dramatic,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "She never gets off the stage; and sometimes she plays to the gallery, and then the stalls say, 'How cheap she's making herself.' She has the elements of a low comedian about her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301263"><said direct="true">"And the airs of a tragedy queen, I suppose,"</said><said direct="false"> added Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301264"><said direct="true">"Exactly,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith; "and the consequence is that she as a burlesque sometimes: She is her own parody."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301265"><said direct="true">"Darling Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> said Grantie with feeling. "I do want to see her again."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301266"><said direct="true">"All her conduct after his death,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Edith, "that was the tragedy queen; she shut herself up in that great house, quite alone, for two months, and went to church with a large prayer-book every morning, at eight. But it was burlesque all the same. Dodo isn't sorry like that. The gallery yelled with applause."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301267"><said direct="true">"I thought it was so sweet of her,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured Grantie. "I suppose I'm gallery too."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301268"><said direct="true">"Then she went abroad,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Edith, "and sat down and wept by the waters of Aix. But she soon took down her harp. She gave banjo parties on the lake, and sang coster songs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301269"><said direct="true">"Mrs. Vane told me she recovered her spirits wonderfully at Aix,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301270"><said direct="true">"And played baccarat, and recovered other people's money,"</said><said direct="false"> pursued Edith. "If she'd taken the first train for Aix after the funeral, I should have respected her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301271"><said direct="true">"Oh, that would have been horrid,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham; "besides, it wouldn't have been the season."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301272"><said direct="true">"That's true,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Dodo probably remembered that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301273"><said direct="true">"Oh, you sha'n't abuse Dodo any more,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I think it's perfectly horrid of you. Go and play me something."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301274"><said direct="false">Perhaps the thought of Chesterford was in Edith's mind as she sat down to the piano, for she played a piece of Mozart's "Requiem," which is the saddest music in the world.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301275"><said direct="false">Miss Grantham shivered a little. The long wailing notes, struck some chord, within her, which disturbed her peace of mind.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301276"><said direct="true">"What a dismal thing,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, when Edith had finished. "You make me feel like Sunday evening after a country church."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301277"><said direct="false">Edith stood looking out of the window. The moon was up, and the great stars were wheeling in their courses through the infinite vault. A nightingale was singing loud in the trees, and the little mysterious noises of night stole about among the bushes. As Edith thought of Chesterford she remembered how the Greeks mistook the passionate song of the bird for the lament of the dead, and it did not seem strange to her. For love, sometimes goes hand-in-hand with death.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301278"><said direct="false">She turned back into the room again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301279"><said direct="true">"God forgive her,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "if we cannot."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301280"><said direct="true">"I'm not going to bed with that requiem in my ears,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I should dream of hearses."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301281"><said direct="false">Edith went to the piano, and broke into a quick, rippling movement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301282"><said direct="false">Miss Grantham listened, and felt she ought to know what it was.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301283"><said direct="true">"What is it?"</said><said direct="false"> she said, when Edith had finished.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301284"><said direct="true">"It is the scherzo from the 'Dodo Symphony,'"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I composed it two years ago at Winston."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301285"><said direct="false">Dodo had written to Edith from Zermatt, where she was enjoying herself amazingly. Mrs. Vane was there, and Mr. and Mrs. Algernon Spencer, and Prince Waldenech and Jack. As there would have been some natural confusion in the hotel if Dodo had called herself Lady Chesterford, when Lord Chesterford was also there, she settled to be called Miss Vane. This tickled Prince Waldenech enormously; it seemed to him a capital joke.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301286"><said direct="false">Dodo was sitting in the verandah of the hotel one afternoon, drinking black coffee and smoking cigarettes. Half the hotel were scandalised at her, and usually referred to her as "that Miss Vane"; the other half adored her, and went [on] expeditions with her, and took minor parts in her theatricals, and generally played universal second fiddle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301287"><said direct="false">Dodo enjoyed this sort of life. There was in her an undeveloped germ of simplicity, that found pleasure in watching the slow-footed, cows driven home from the pastures, in sitting with Jack—regardless of her assumed name—in the crocus-studded meadows, or by the side of the swirling glacier-fed stream that makes the valley melodious. She argued, with great reason, that she had already shocked all the people that were going to be shocked, so much that it didn't matter what she did; while the other contingent, who were not going to be shocked, were not going to be shocked. "Everyone must either be shocked or not shocked," she said, "and they're that already. That's why Prince Waldenech and I are going for a moonlight walk next week when the moon comes back."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301288"><said direct="false">Dodo had made great friends with the Prince's half-sister, a Russian on her mother's side, and she was reading her extracts out of her unwritten book of the Philosophy of Life, an interesting work, which varied considerably according to Dodo's mood. Just now it suited Dodo to be in love with life.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301289"><said direct="true">"You are a Russian by nature and sympathy, my dear Princess,"</said><said direct="false"> she was saying, "and you are therefore in a continual state of complete boredom. You think you are bored here, because it is not Paris; in Paris you are quite as much bored with all your fêtes, and dances, and parties as you are here. I tell you frankly you are wrong. Why don't you come and sit in the grass, and look at the crocuses, and throw stones into the stream like me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301290"><said direct="false">The Princess stretched out a delicate arm.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301291"><said direct="true">"I don't think I ever threw a stone in my life,"</said><said direct="false"> she said dubiously. "Would it amuse me, do you think?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301292"><said direct="true">"Not at first,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "and you will never be amused at all if you think about it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301293"><said direct="true">"What am I to think about then?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301294"><said direct="true">"You must think about the stone,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo decisively, "you must think about the crocuses, you must think about the cows."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301295"><said direct="true">"It's all so new to me,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked the Princess. "We never think about cows in Russia."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301296"><said direct="true">"That's just what I'm saying,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You must get out of yourself. Anything, does to think about, and nobody is bored unless they think about being bored. When one has the whole world to choose from, and only one subject in it that can make one feel bored, it really shows a want of resource to think about that. Then you ought to take walks and make yourself tired."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301297"><said direct="false">The Princess cast a vague eye on the Matterhorn.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301298"><said direct="true">"That sort of horror?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301299"><said direct="true">"No, you needn't begin with the Matterhorn,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, laughing. "Go to the glaciers, and get rather cold and wet. Boredom is chiefly physical."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301300"><said direct="true">"I'm sure being cold and wet would bore me frightfully,"</said><said direct="false"> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301301"><said direct="true">"No, no—a big no,"</said><said direct="false"> cried Dodo. "No one is ever bored unless they are comfortable. That's the great principle. There isn't time for it. You cannot be bored and something else at the same time. Being comfortable doesn't count; that's our normal condition. But you needn't be uncomfortable in order to be bored. It's very comfortable sitting here with you, and I'm not the least bored. I should poison myself if I were bored: I can't think why you don't."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301302"><said direct="true">"I will do anything you recommend,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess placidly. "You are the only woman I know who never appears to be bored. I wonder if my husband would bore you. He is very big, and very good, and he eats a large breakfast, and looks after his serfs. He bores me to extinction. He would wear black for ten years if I poisoned myself."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301303"><said direct="false">A shade of something passed over Dodo's face. It might have been regret, or stifled remembrance, or a sudden twinge of pain, and it lasted an appreciable fraction of a second.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301304"><said direct="true">"I can imagine being bored with that kind of man,"</said><said direct="false"> she said in a moment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301305"><said direct="false">The Princess was lying back in her chair,' and did not notice a curious hardness in Dodo's voice.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301306"><said direct="true">"I should so-like to introduce you to him,"</said><said direct="false"> said she. "I should like to shut you up with him for a month at our place on the Volga. It snows a good deal there, and he goes out in the snow and shoots animals, and comes back in the evening with a red face, and tells me all about it. It is very entertaining, but a trifle monotonous. He does not know English, nor German, nor French. He laughs very loud. He is devoted to me. Do go and stay with him. I think I'll join you when you've been there three weeks. He is quite safe. I shall not be afraid. He writes to me every day, and suggests that he should join me here."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301307"><said direct="false">Dodo shifted her position and looked up at the Matterhorn.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301308"><said direct="true">"Yes,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I should certainly be bored with him, but I'm not sure that I would show it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301309"><said direct="true">"He wouldn't like you at all,"</said><said direct="false"> continued the Princess. "He would think you loud. That is so odd. He thinks it unfeminine to smoke. He has great ideas about the position of women. He gave me a book of private devotions bound in the parchment from a bear he had shot on my last birthday."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301310"><said direct="false">Dodo laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301311"><said direct="true">"I'm sure you need not be bored with him,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "He must have a strong vein of unconscious humour about him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301312"><said direct="true">"I'm quite unconscious of it,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "You cannot form the slightest idea of what he's like till you see him. I almost feel inclined to tell him to come here."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301313"><said direct="true">"Ah, but you Russian women have such liberty,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You can tell your husband not to expect to see you again for three months. We can't do that. An English husband and wife are like two Siamese twins. Until about ten years ago they used to enter the drawing-room, when they were going out to dinner, arm-in-arm."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301314"><said direct="true">"That's very bourgeois,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "You are rather a bourgeois race. You are very hearty, and pleased to see one, and all that. There's Lord Chesterford. You're a great friend of his, aren't you? He looks very distinguished. I should say he was usually bored."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301315"><said direct="true">"He was my husband's first cousin,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. Princess Alexandrina of course knew that Miss Vane was a widow. "I was always an old friend of his—as long as I can remember, that's to say. Jack and I are going up towards the Eiffel to watch the sunset. Come with us."</said></p>

<sample><p n="ENG189301161"><said direct="true">"I must speak to him alone,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Send them all out."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301162"><said direct="true">"They have gone into the dressing-room,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vivian; "he is alone."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301163"><said direct="false">Dodo stayed no longer, but went in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301164"><said direct="false">He was lying facing the door, and the shadow of death was on his face. But he recognised Dodo, and smiled and held out his hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301165"><said direct="false">Dodo ran to the bedside and knelt by it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301166"><said direct="true">"Oh, Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> she sobbed, "I have wronged you cruelly, and I can never make it up. I will tell you all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301167"><said direct="true">"There is no need,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "I knew it all along."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301168"><said direct="false">Dodo raised her head. "You knew it all?" she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301169"><said direct="true">"Yes, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "it was by accident that I knew it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301170"><said direct="true">"And you behaved to me as usual,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301171"><said direct="true">"Yes, my darling,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "you wouldn't have had me beat you, would you? Don't speak of it—there is not much time."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301172"><said direct="true">"Ah, forgive me, forgive me!"</said><said direct="false"> she cried. "How could I have done it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301173"><said direct="true">"It was not a case of forgiving,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "You are you, you are Dodo. My darling, there is not time to say much. You have been very good to me, and have given me more happiness than I ever thought I could have had."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301174"><said direct="true">"Chesterford! Chesterford!"</said><said direct="false"> cried Dodo pleadingly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301175"><said direct="true">"Yes, darling,"</said><said direct="false"> he answered; "my own wife. Dodo, I shall see the boy soon, and we will wait for you together. You will be mine again then. There shall be no more parting."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301176"><said direct="false">Dodo could not answer him. She could only press his hand and kiss his lips, which were growing very white.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301177"><said direct="false">It was becoming a fearful effort for him to speak. The words came slowly with long pauses.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301178"><said direct="true">"There is one more thing,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "You must marry Jack. You must make him very happy—as you have made me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301179"><said direct="true">"Ah, don't say that,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo brokenly; "don't cut me to the heart."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301180"><said direct="true">"My darling,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "my sweet own wife, I am so glad you told me. It has cleared up the only cloud. I wondered whether you would tell me. I prayed God you might, and He has granted it me. Good-bye, my own darling, good-bye."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301181"><said direct="false">Dodo lay in his arms, and kissed him passionately.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301182"><said direct="true">"Good-bye, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> she sobbed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301183"><said direct="false">He half raised himself in bed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301184"><said direct="true">"Ah, my Dodo, my sweet wife,"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301185"><said direct="false">Then he fell back and lay very still.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301186"><said direct="false">How long Dodo remained there she did not know. She remembered Mrs. Vivian coming in and raising her gently, and they left the darkened room together.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301187"><said direct="false">Picture to yourself, or let me try to picture for you, a long, low, rambling house, covering a quite unnecessary area of ground, with many gables, tall, red-brick chimneys, unexpected corners, and little bow windows looking out from narrow turrets-a house that looks as if it had grown, rather than been designed and built. It began obviously with that little grey stone section, which seems to consist of small rooms with mullion windows, over which the ivy has asserted so supreme a dominion. The next occupant had been a man who knew how to make himself comfortable, but did not care in the least what sort of appearance his additions would wear to the world at large; to him we may assign that uncompromising straight wing which projects to the right of the little core of grey stone. Then came a series of attempts to screen the puritanical ugliness of the offending block. Some one ran up two little turrets at one end, and a clock tower in the middle; one side of it was made the main entrance of the house, and two red-tiled lines of building were built at right angles to it to form a three-sided quadrangle, and the carriage drive was brought up in a wide sweep to the door, and a sun-dial was planted down in the grass plot in the middle, in such a way that the sun could only peep at it for an hour or two every day, owing to the line of building which sheltered it on every side except the north. So the old house went on growing, and got more incongruous and more delightful with every addition.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301188"><said direct="false">The garden has had to take care of itself under such circumstances, and if the house has been pushing it back in one place, it has wormed itself in at another, and queer little lawns with flower beds of old-fashioned, sweet-smelling plants have crept in where you least expect them. This particular garden has always seemed to me the ideal of what a garden should be. It is made to sit in, to smoke in, to think in, to do nothing in. A wavy, irregular lawn forbids the possibility of tennis, or any game that implies exertion or skill, and it is the home of sweet smells, bright colour, and chuckling birds. There are long borders of mignonette, wallflowers and hollyhocks, and many old-fashioned flowers, which are going the way of all old fashions. London pride, with its delicate spirals and star-like blossoms, and the red drooping velvet of love-lies-a-bleeding. The thump of tennis balls, the flying horrors of ring-goal, even the clash of croquet is tabooed in this sacred spot. Down below, indeed, beyond that thick privet hedge, you may find, if you wish, a smooth, well-kept piece of grass, where, even now—if we may judge from white figures that cross the little square, where a swinging iron gate seems to remonstrate hastily and ill-temperedly with those who leave these reflective shades for the glare and publicity of tennis—a game seems to be in progress. If you had exploring tendencies in your nature, and had happened to find yourself, on the afternoon of which I propose to speak, in this delightful garden, you would sooner or later have wandered into a low-lying grassy basin, shut in on three sides by banks of bushy rose-trees. The faint, delicate smell of their pale fragrance would have led you there, or, perhaps, the light trickling of a fountain, now nearly summer dry. Perhaps the exploring tendency would account for your discovery. There, lying back in a basket-chair, with a half-read letter in her hand, and an accusing tennis racquet by her side, you would have found Edith Staines. She had waited after lunch to get her letters, and going out, meaning to join the others, she had found something among them that interested her, and she was reading a certain letter through a second time when you broke in upon her. After a few minutes she folded it up, put it back in the envelope, and sat still, thinking. "So she's going to marry him," she said half aloud, and she took up her racquet and went down to the tennis courts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301189"><said direct="false">Ten days ago she had come down to stay with Miss Grantham, at the end of the London season. Miss Grantham's father was a somewhat florid baronet of fifty years of age. He had six feet of height, a cheerful, high-coloured face, and a moustache, which he was just conscious had military suggestions about it—though he had never been in the army—which was beginning to grow grey. His wife had been a lovely woman, half Spanish by birth, with that peculiarly crisp pronunciation that English people so seldom possess, and which is almost as charming to hear as a child's first conscious grasp of new words. She dressed remarkably well; her reading chiefly consisted of the Morning Post, French novels, and small books of morbid poetry, which seemed to her very chic, and she was worldly to the tips of her delicate fingers. She had no accomplishments of any sort, except a great knowledge of foreign languages. She argued, with much reason, that you could get other people to do your accomplishments for you. "Why should I worry myself with playing scales?" she said. "I can hire some poor wretch" (she never could quite manage the English "r") "to play to me by the hour. He will play much better than I ever should, and it is a form of charity as well."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301190"><said direct="false">Edith had made great friends with her, and disagreed with her on every topic under the sun. Lady Grantham admired Edith's vivacity, though her own line was serene elegance, and respected her success. Success was the one accomplishment that she really looked up to (partly, perhaps, because she felt she had such a large measure of it herself), and no one could deny that Edith was successful. She had enough broadness of view to admire success in any line, and would have had a vague sense of satisfaction in accepting the arm of; the best crossing-sweeper in London to take her in to dinner. She lived in a leonine atmosphere, and if you did not happen to meet a particular lion at her house, it was because "he was here on Monday, or is coming on Wednesday"; at any rate, not because he had not been asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301191"><said direct="false">Edith, however, felt thoroughly pleased with her quarters. She had hinted once that she had to go the day after to-morrow, but Nora Grantham had declined to argue the question. "You're only going home to do your music," she said. "We've got quite as good a piano here as you have, and, we leave you entirely to your own devices. Besides, you're mother's lion just now—isn't she, mother?—and you're not going to get out of the menagerie just yet. There is going to be a big feeding-time next week, and you will have to roar." Edith's remark about the necessity of going had been dictated only by a sense of duty, in order to give her hosts an opportunity of getting rid of her if they wished, and she was quite content to stop. She strolled down across the lawn to the tennis courts in a thoughtful frame of mind, and met Miss Grantham, who was coming to look for her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301192"><said direct="true">"Where have you been, Edith?"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "They're all clamouring for you. Mother is sitting in the summer-house wondering why anybody wants to play tennis. She says none of them will ever be as good as Cracklin, and he's a cad."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301193"><said direct="true">"Grantie,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith, "Dodo's engaged."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301194"><said direct="true">"Oh, dear, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I knew she would be. How delightful. Jack's got his reward at last. May I tell everyone? How funny that she should marry a Lord Chesterford twice. It was so convenient that the first one shouldn't have had any brothers, and Dodo won't have to change her visiting cards; or have new handkerchiefs or anything. What a contrast, though!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301195"><said direct="true">"No, it's private at present,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Dodo has just written to me; she told me I might tell you. Do you altogether like it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301196"><said direct="true">"Of course I do,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "Only I should like to marry Jack myself. I wonder if he asked Dodo, or if Dodo asked him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301197"><said direct="true">"I suppose it was inevitable,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Dodo says that Chesterford's last words to her were that she should marry Jack."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301198"><said direct="true">"That was so sweet of him,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured Miss Grantham. "He was very sweet and dear and remembering, wasn't he?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301199"><said direct="false">Edith was still grave and doubtful.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301200"><said direct="true">"I'm sure there was nearly a crash,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Do you remember the Brettons' ball? Chesterford didn't like that, and they quarrelled, I know, next morning."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301201"><said direct="true">"Oh, how interesting,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "But Dodo was quite right to go, I think. She was dreadfully bored, and she will not stand being bored. She might have done something much worse."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301202"><said direct="true">"It seems to be imperatively necessary for Dodo to do something unexpected,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "I wonder, oh, I wonder—Jack will be very happy for a time," she added inconsequently.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301203"><said direct="false">Edith's coming was the signal for serious play to begin. She entirely declined to play except with people who considered it, for the time being, the most important thing in the world, and naturally she played well.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301204"><said direct="false">A young man, of military appearance on a small scale, was sitting by Lady Grantham in the tent, and entertaining her with somewhat unfledged remarks.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301205"><said direct="true">"Miss Staines does play so arfly well, doesn't she?"</said><said direct="false"> he was saying. "Look at that stroke, perfectly rippin' you know, what?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301206"><said direct="false">Mr. Featherstone had a habit of finishing all his sentences with "what?" He pronounced it to rhyme with heart.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301207"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham was reading Loti's book of pity and death. It answered the double purpose of being French and morbid.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301208"><said direct="true">"What book have you got hold of there?"</said><said direct="false"> continued Featherstone. "It's an awful bore reading books, dontcherthink, what? I wish one could get a feller to read them for me, and then tell one about them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301209"><said direct="true">"I rather enjoy some books,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. "This, for instance, is a good one," and she held the book towards him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301210"><said direct="true">"Oh, that's French, isn't it?"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Featherstone. "I did French at school; don't know a word now. It's an arful bore having to learn French, isn't it? Couldn't I get a feller to learn it for me?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301211"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham reflected.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301212"><said direct="true">"I daresay you could,"</said><said direct="false"> she replied. "You might get your man—tiger—how do you call him?—to learn it. It's capable of comprehension to the lowest intellect," she added crisply.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301213"><said direct="true">"Oh, come, Lady Grantham,"</said><said direct="false"> he replied, "you don't think so badly of me as that, do you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301214"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham was seized with a momentary desire to run her parasol through his body, provided it could be done languidly and without effort. Her daughter had come up, and sat down in a low chair by her. Featherstone was devoting the whole of his great mind to the end of his moustache.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301215"><said direct="true">"Nora,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, quietly, "this little man must be taken away. I can't quite manage him. Tell him to go and play about."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301216"><said direct="true">"Dear mother,"</said><said direct="false"> she replied, "bear him a little longer. He can't play about by himself."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301217"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham got gently up from her chair, and thrust an exquisite little silver paper-knife between the leaves of her book.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301218"><said direct="true">"I think I will ask you to take my chair across to that tree opposite,"</said><said direct="false"> she said to him, without looking at him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301219"><said direct="false">He followed her, dragging the chair after him. Halfway across the lawn they met a footman bringing tea down into the ground.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301220"><said direct="true">"Take the chair,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. Then she turned to her little man. "Many thanks. I won't detain you," she said, with a sweet smile. "So good of you to have come here this afternoon."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301221"><said direct="false">Featherstone was impenetrable. He lounged back, if so small a thing can be said to lounge, and sat down again by Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301222"><said direct="true">"Fascinatin' woman your mother is,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Arfly clever, isn't she? What? Knows French and that sort of thing. I can always get along all right in France. If you only swear at the waiters they understand what you want all right, you know."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301223"><said direct="false">Two or three other fresh arrivals made it possible for another set to be started, and Mr. Featherstone was induced to play, in spite of his protestations that he had quite given up tennis for polo. Lady Grantham finished her Loti, and moved back to the tea-table, where Edith was sitting, fanning herself with a cabbage leaf, and receiving homage on the score of her tennis-playing. Lady Grantham did not offer to give anybody any tea; she supposed they would take it when they wanted it, but she wished someone would give her a cup.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301224"><said direct="true">"What's the name of the little man and his moustache?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked Edith, indicating Mr. Featherstone, who was performing wild antics in the next court.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301225"><said direct="false">Edith informed her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301226"><said direct="true">"How did he get here?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Lady Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301227"><said direct="true">"Oh, he's a friend of mine. I think he came to see me,"</said><said direct="false"> replied Edith. "He lives somewhere about. I suppose you find him rather trying. It doesn't matter; he's of no consequence."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301228"><said direct="true">"My dear Edith, between your sporting curate, and your German conductor, and your Roman Catholic cure, and this man, one's life isn't safe."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301229"><said direct="true">"You won't see the good side of those sort of people,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "If they've got rather overwhelming manners, and aren't as silent and bored as you think young men ought to be, you think they're utter outsiders."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301230"><said direct="true">"I only want to know if there are any more of that sort going to turn up. Think of the positions you put me in! When I went into the drawing-room yesterday, for instance, before lunch, I find a Roman Catholic priest there, who puts up two fingers at me, and says 'Benedicite.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301231"><said direct="false">Edith lay back in her chair and laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301232"><said direct="true">"How I should like to have seen you! Did you think he was saying grace, or did you tell him not to be insolent?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301233"><said direct="true">"I behaved with admirable moderation,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. "I even prepared to be nice to him. But he had sudden misgivings, and said, 'I beg your pardon, I thought you were Miss Staines.' I saw I was not wanted, and retreated. That is not all. Bob told me that I had to take a curate in to dinner last night, and asked me not to frighten him. I suppose he thought I wanted to say 'Bo,' or howl at him. The curate tried me. I sat down when we got to the table, and he turned to me and said, 'I beg your pardon'—they all beg my pardon—'but I'm going to say grace.' Then I prepared myself to talk night schools and district visiting; but he turned on me, and asked what I thought of Orme's chances for the St. Leger."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301234"><said direct="true">"Oh, dear! oh, dear!"</said><said direct="false"> cried Edith; "he told me afterwards that you seemed a very serious lady."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301235"><said direct="true">"I didn't intend to encourage that,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Lady Grantham; "so I held on to district visiting. We shook our heads together over dissent in Wales. We split over Calvinism—who was Calvin? We renounced society; and I was going to work him a pair of slippers. We were very edifying. Then he sang comic songs in the drawing-room, and discussed the methods of cheating at baccarat. I was a dead failure."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301236"><said direct="true">"Anyhow, you're a serious lady,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301237"><said direct="true">"That young man will come to a bad end,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham; "so will your German conductor. He ordered beer in the middle of the morning, to-day—the second footman will certainly give notice—and he smoked a little clay pipe after dinner in the dining-room. Then this afternoon comes this other friend of yours. He says, 'Arfly rippin' what.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301238"><said direct="true">"He said you were arfly fascinatin' what,"</said><said direct="false"> interpolated Miss Grantham, "when you went away to read your book. You were very rude to him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301239"><said direct="false">Sir Robert Grantham had joined the party. He was a great hand at adapting his conversation to his audience, and making everyone conscious that they ought to feel quite at home. He recounted at some length a series of tennis matches which he had taken part in a few years ago. A strained elbow had spoiled his chances of winning, but the games were most exciting, and it was generally agreed at the time that the form of the players was quite first-class. He talked about Wagner and counterpoint to Edith. He asked his vicar abstruse questions on the evidence of the immortality of the soul after death; he discussed agriculture and farming with tenants, to whom he always said "thank ye," instead of "thank you," in order that they might feel quite at their ease; he lamented the want of physique in the English army to Mr. Featherstone, who was very short, and declared that the average height of Englishmen was only five feet four. As he said this he drew himself up, and made it quite obvious that he himself was six feet high, and broad in proportion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301240"><said direct="false">A few more cups of tea were drunk, and a few more sets played, and the party dispersed. Edith was the only guest in the house, and she and Frank, the Oxford son, stopped behind to play a game or two more before dinner. Lady Grantham and Nora strolled up through the garden towards the house, while Sir Robert remained on the ground, and mingled advice, criticism, and approbation to the tennis players; Frank's back-handed stroke, he thought, was not as good as it might be, and Edith could, certainly put half fifteen on to her game if judiciously coached. Neither of the players volleyed as well as himself, but volleying was his strong point, and they must not be discouraged. Frank's attitude to his father was that of undisguised amusement; but he found him very entertaining.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301241"><said direct="false">They were all rather late for dinner, and Lady Grantham was waiting for them in the drawing-room. Frank and his father were down before Edith, and Lady Grantham was making remarks on their personal appearance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301242"><said direct="true">"You look very, hot and red,"</said><said direct="false"> she was saying to her son, "and I really wish you would brush your hair better. I don't know what young men are coming to, they seem to think that everything is to be kept waiting for them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301243"><said direct="false">Frank's attitude was one of serene indifference.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301244"><said direct="true">"Go on, go on,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "I don't mind."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301245"><said direct="false">Edith was five minutes later. Lady Grantham remarked on the importance of being in time for dinner, and hoped they wouldn't all die from going to bed too soon afterwards. Frank apologised for his mother.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301246"><said direct="true">"Don't mind her, Miss Staines,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "they're only her foreign manners. She doesn't know how to behave. It's all right. I'm going to take you in, mother. Are we going to have grouse?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301247"><said direct="false">That evening Miss Grantham and Edith "talked Dodo," as the latter called it, till the small hours.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301248"><said direct="false">She produced Dodo's letter, and read extracts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301249"><said direct="true">"Of course, we sha'n't be married till after next November,"</said><said direct="false"> wrote Dodo. "Jack wouldn't hear of it, and it would seem very unfeeling. Don't you think so? It will be odd going back to Winston again. Mind you come and stay with us at Easter."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301250"><said direct="true">"I wonder if Dodo ever thinks with regret of anything or anybody,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Imagine writing like that—asking me if I shouldn't think it unfeeling."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301251"><said direct="true">"Oh, but she says she would think it unfeeling,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "That's so sweet and remembering of her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301252"><said direct="true">"But don't you see,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith, "she evidently thinks it is so good of her to have feelings about it at all. She might as well call attention to the fact that she always puts her shoes and stockings on to go to church."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301253"><said direct="true">"There's a lot of women who would marry again before a year was out if it wasn't for convention,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301254"><said direct="true">"That's probably the case with Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Edith. "Dodo doesn't care one pin for the memory of that man. She knows it, and she knows I know it. Why does she say that sort of thing to me? He was a good man, too, and I'm not sure that he wasn't great. Chesterford detested me, but I recognised him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301255"><said direct="true">"Oh, I don't think he was great,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "Didn't he always strike you as a little stupid?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301256"><said direct="true">"I prefer stupid people,"</said><said direct="false"> declared Edith roundly. "They are so restful. They're like nice; sweet, white bread; they quench your hunger as well as pâté de foie gras, and they are much better for you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301257"><said direct="true">"I think they make you just a little thirsty,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Miss Grantham. "I should have said they were more like cracknels. Besides, do you think that it's an advantage to associate with people who are good for you? It produces a sort of rabies in me. I want to bite them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301258"><said direct="true">"You like making yourself out worse than you are, Grantie,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301259"><said direct="true">"I think you like making Dodo out worse than she is,"</said><said direct="false"> returned Nora. "I always used to think you were very fond of her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301260"><said direct="true">"I am fond of her,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith; "that's why I'm dissatisfied with her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301261"><said direct="true">"What a curious way of showing your affection,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I love Dodo, and if I was a man I should like to many her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301262"><said direct="true">"Dodo is too dramatic,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "She never gets off the stage; and sometimes she plays to the gallery, and then the stalls say, 'How cheap she's making herself.' She has the elements of a low comedian about her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301263"><said direct="true">"And the airs of a tragedy queen, I suppose,"</said><said direct="false"> added Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301264"><said direct="true">"Exactly,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith; "and the consequence is that she as a burlesque sometimes: She is her own parody."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301265"><said direct="true">"Darling Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> said Grantie with feeling. "I do want to see her again."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301266"><said direct="true">"All her conduct after his death,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Edith, "that was the tragedy queen; she shut herself up in that great house, quite alone, for two months, and went to church with a large prayer-book every morning, at eight. But it was burlesque all the same. Dodo isn't sorry like that. The gallery yelled with applause."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301267"><said direct="true">"I thought it was so sweet of her,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured Grantie. "I suppose I'm gallery too."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301268"><said direct="true">"Then she went abroad,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Edith, "and sat down and wept by the waters of Aix. But she soon took down her harp. She gave banjo parties on the lake, and sang coster songs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301269"><said direct="true">"Mrs. Vane told me she recovered her spirits wonderfully at Aix,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301270"><said direct="true">"And played baccarat, and recovered other people's money,"</said><said direct="false"> pursued Edith. "If she'd taken the first train for Aix after the funeral, I should have respected her."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301271"><said direct="true">"Oh, that would have been horrid,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham; "besides, it wouldn't have been the season."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301272"><said direct="true">"That's true,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "Dodo probably remembered that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301273"><said direct="true">"Oh, you sha'n't abuse Dodo any more,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I think it's perfectly horrid of you. Go and play me something."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301274"><said direct="false">Perhaps the thought of Chesterford was in Edith's mind as she sat down to the piano, for she played a piece of Mozart's "Requiem," which is the saddest music in the world.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301275"><said direct="false">Miss Grantham shivered a little. The long wailing notes, struck some chord, within her, which disturbed her peace of mind.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301276"><said direct="true">"What a dismal thing,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, when Edith had finished. "You make me feel like Sunday evening after a country church."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301277"><said direct="false">Edith stood looking out of the window. The moon was up, and the great stars were wheeling in their courses through the infinite vault. A nightingale was singing loud in the trees, and the little mysterious noises of night stole about among the bushes. As Edith thought of Chesterford she remembered how the Greeks mistook the passionate song of the bird for the lament of the dead, and it did not seem strange to her. For love, sometimes goes hand-in-hand with death.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301278"><said direct="false">She turned back into the room again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301279"><said direct="true">"God forgive her,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "if we cannot."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301280"><said direct="true">"I'm not going to bed with that requiem in my ears,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I should dream of hearses."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301281"><said direct="false">Edith went to the piano, and broke into a quick, rippling movement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301282"><said direct="false">Miss Grantham listened, and felt she ought to know what it was.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301283"><said direct="true">"What is it?"</said><said direct="false"> she said, when Edith had finished.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301284"><said direct="true">"It is the scherzo from the 'Dodo Symphony,'"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I composed it two years ago at Winston."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301285"><said direct="false">Dodo had written to Edith from Zermatt, where she was enjoying herself amazingly. Mrs. Vane was there, and Mr. and Mrs. Algernon Spencer, and Prince Waldenech and Jack. As there would have been some natural confusion in the hotel if Dodo had called herself Lady Chesterford, when Lord Chesterford was also there, she settled to be called Miss Vane. This tickled Prince Waldenech enormously; it seemed to him a capital joke.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301286"><said direct="false">Dodo was sitting in the verandah of the hotel one afternoon, drinking black coffee and smoking cigarettes. Half the hotel were scandalised at her, and usually referred to her as "that Miss Vane"; the other half adored her, and went [on] expeditions with her, and took minor parts in her theatricals, and generally played universal second fiddle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301287"><said direct="false">Dodo enjoyed this sort of life. There was in her an undeveloped germ of simplicity, that found pleasure in watching the slow-footed, cows driven home from the pastures, in sitting with Jack—regardless of her assumed name—in the crocus-studded meadows, or by the side of the swirling glacier-fed stream that makes the valley melodious. She argued, with great reason, that she had already shocked all the people that were going to be shocked, so much that it didn't matter what she did; while the other contingent, who were not going to be shocked, were not going to be shocked. "Everyone must either be shocked or not shocked," she said, "and they're that already. That's why Prince Waldenech and I are going for a moonlight walk next week when the moon comes back."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301288"><said direct="false">Dodo had made great friends with the Prince's half-sister, a Russian on her mother's side, and she was reading her extracts out of her unwritten book of the Philosophy of Life, an interesting work, which varied considerably according to Dodo's mood. Just now it suited Dodo to be in love with life.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301289"><said direct="true">"You are a Russian by nature and sympathy, my dear Princess,"</said><said direct="false"> she was saying, "and you are therefore in a continual state of complete boredom. You think you are bored here, because it is not Paris; in Paris you are quite as much bored with all your fêtes, and dances, and parties as you are here. I tell you frankly you are wrong. Why don't you come and sit in the grass, and look at the crocuses, and throw stones into the stream like me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301290"><said direct="false">The Princess stretched out a delicate arm.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301291"><said direct="true">"I don't think I ever threw a stone in my life,"</said><said direct="false"> she said dubiously. "Would it amuse me, do you think?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301292"><said direct="true">"Not at first,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "and you will never be amused at all if you think about it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301293"><said direct="true">"What am I to think about then?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301294"><said direct="true">"You must think about the stone,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo decisively, "you must think about the crocuses, you must think about the cows."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301295"><said direct="true">"It's all so new to me,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked the Princess. "We never think about cows in Russia."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301296"><said direct="true">"That's just what I'm saying,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You must get out of yourself. Anything, does to think about, and nobody is bored unless they think about being bored. When one has the whole world to choose from, and only one subject in it that can make one feel bored, it really shows a want of resource to think about that. Then you ought to take walks and make yourself tired."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301297"><said direct="false">The Princess cast a vague eye on the Matterhorn.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301298"><said direct="true">"That sort of horror?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301299"><said direct="true">"No, you needn't begin with the Matterhorn,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, laughing. "Go to the glaciers, and get rather cold and wet. Boredom is chiefly physical."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301300"><said direct="true">"I'm sure being cold and wet would bore me frightfully,"</said><said direct="false"> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301301"><said direct="true">"No, no—a big no,"</said><said direct="false"> cried Dodo. "No one is ever bored unless they are comfortable. That's the great principle. There isn't time for it. You cannot be bored and something else at the same time. Being comfortable doesn't count; that's our normal condition. But you needn't be uncomfortable in order to be bored. It's very comfortable sitting here with you, and I'm not the least bored. I should poison myself if I were bored: I can't think why you don't."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301302"><said direct="true">"I will do anything you recommend,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess placidly. "You are the only woman I know who never appears to be bored. I wonder if my husband would bore you. He is very big, and very good, and he eats a large breakfast, and looks after his serfs. He bores me to extinction. He would wear black for ten years if I poisoned myself."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301303"><said direct="false">A shade of something passed over Dodo's face. It might have been regret, or stifled remembrance, or a sudden twinge of pain, and it lasted an appreciable fraction of a second.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301304"><said direct="true">"I can imagine being bored with that kind of man,"</said><said direct="false"> she said in a moment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301305"><said direct="false">The Princess was lying back in her chair,' and did not notice a curious hardness in Dodo's voice.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301306"><said direct="true">"I should so-like to introduce you to him,"</said><said direct="false"> said she. "I should like to shut you up with him for a month at our place on the Volga. It snows a good deal there, and he goes out in the snow and shoots animals, and comes back in the evening with a red face, and tells me all about it. It is very entertaining, but a trifle monotonous. He does not know English, nor German, nor French. He laughs very loud. He is devoted to me. Do go and stay with him. I think I'll join you when you've been there three weeks. He is quite safe. I shall not be afraid. He writes to me every day, and suggests that he should join me here."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301307"><said direct="false">Dodo shifted her position and looked up at the Matterhorn.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301308"><said direct="true">"Yes,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I should certainly be bored with him, but I'm not sure that I would show it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301309"><said direct="true">"He wouldn't like you at all,"</said><said direct="false"> continued the Princess. "He would think you loud. That is so odd. He thinks it unfeminine to smoke. He has great ideas about the position of women. He gave me a book of private devotions bound in the parchment from a bear he had shot on my last birthday."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301310"><said direct="false">Dodo laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301311"><said direct="true">"I'm sure you need not be bored with him,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "He must have a strong vein of unconscious humour about him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301312"><said direct="true">"I'm quite unconscious of it,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "You cannot form the slightest idea of what he's like till you see him. I almost feel inclined to tell him to come here."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301313"><said direct="true">"Ah, but you Russian women have such liberty,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You can tell your husband not to expect to see you again for three months. We can't do that. An English husband and wife are like two Siamese twins. Until about ten years ago they used to enter the drawing-room, when they were going out to dinner, arm-in-arm."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301314"><said direct="true">"That's very bourgeois,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "You are rather a bourgeois race. You are very hearty, and pleased to see one, and all that. There's Lord Chesterford. You're a great friend of his, aren't you? He looks very distinguished. I should say he was usually bored."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301315"><said direct="true">"He was my husband's first cousin,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. Princess Alexandrina of course knew that Miss Vane was a widow. "I was always an old friend of his—as long as I can remember, that's to say. Jack and I are going up towards the Eiffel to watch the sunset. Come with us."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301316"><said direct="true">"I think I'll see the sunset from here,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You're going up a hill, I suppose?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301317"><said direct="true">"Oh, but you can't see it from here,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "That great mass of mountain is in the way."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301318"><said direct="false">The Princess considered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301319"><said direct="true">"I don't think I want to see the sunset after all,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I've just found the Kreutzer Sonata. I've been rural enough for one day, and I want a breath of civilised air. Do you know, I never feel bored when you are talking to me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301320"><said direct="true">"Oh, that's part of my charm, isn't it?"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo to Jack, who had lounged up to where they were sitting.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301321"><said direct="true">"Dodo's been lecturing me, Lord Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "Does she ever lecture you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301322"><said direct="true">"She gave me quite a long lecture once,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "She recommended me to live in a cathedral town."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301323"><said direct="true">"A cathedral town,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "That's something fearful, isn't it? Why did you tell him to do that?" she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301324"><said direct="true">"I think it was a mistake,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Anyhow, Jack didn't take my advice. I shouldn't recommend him to do it now, but he has a perfect genius for being domestic. Everyone is very domestic in cathedral towns. They all dine at seven and breakfast at a quarter past eight—next morning, you understand. That quarter past is delightful. But Jack said he didn't want to score small successes," she added, employing a figure grammatically known as "hiatus."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301325"><said direct="true">"My husband is very domestic,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "But he isn't a bit like Lord Chesterford. He would like to live with me in a little house in the country, and never have anyone to stay with us. That would be so cheerful during the winter months."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301326"><said direct="true">"Jack, would you like to live with your wife in a little house in the country?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301327"><said direct="true">"I don't think I should ever marry a woman who wanted to,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Jack, meeting Dodo's glance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301328"><said direct="true">"Imagine two people really liking each other better than all the rest of the world,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess, "and living on milk, and love, and wild roses, and fresh eggs! I can't bear fresh eggs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301329"><said direct="true">"My egg this morning wasn't at all fresh,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I wish I'd thought of sending it to your room."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301330"><said direct="true">"Would you never get tired of your wife, don't you think,"</said><said direct="false"> continued the Princess, "if you shut yourselves up in the country? Supposing she wished to pick roses when you wanted to play lawn tennis?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301331"><said direct="true">"Oh, Jack, it wouldn't do,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You'd make her play lawn tennis."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301332"><said direct="true">"My husband and I never thought of playing lawn tennis,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "I shall try that when we meet next. It's very amusing, isn't it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301333"><said direct="true">"It makes you die of laughing,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, solemnly. "Come, Jack, we're going to see the sunset. Good-bye, dear. Go and play with your maid. She can go out of the room while you think of something, and then come in and guess what you've thought of."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301334"><said direct="false">Jack and Dodo strolled up through the sweet-smelling meadows towards the Riffelberg. A cool breeze was streaming down from the "furrow cloven alls" of the glacier, heavy with the clean smell of pine woods and summer flowers, and thick with a hundred mingling sounds. The cows were being driven homewards, and the faint sounds of bells were carried down to them from the green heights above. Now and then they passed a herd of goats, still nibbling anxiously at the wayside grass, followed by some small ragged shepherd, who brushed his long hair away from his eyes to get a better look at this dazzling, fair-skinned woman, who evidently belonged to quite another order of beings from his wrinkled, early-old mother. One of them held out to Dodo a wilted little bunch of flowers, crumpled with much handling, but she did not seem to notice him. After they had passed he tossed them away, and ran off after his straying flock. Southwards, high above them, stretched the long lines of snow spread out under the feet of the Matterhorn, which sat like some huge sphinx, unapproachable, remote. Just below lay the village, sleeping in the last rays of the sun, which shone warmly on the red, weathered planks. Light blue smoke curled slowly up from the shingled roofs, and streamed gently down the valley in a thin, transparent haze.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301335"><said direct="true">"Decidedly, it's a very nice world,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I'm so glad I wasn't born a Russian. The Princess never enjoys anything at all, except telling one how bored she is. But she's very amusing, and I gave her a great deal of good advice."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301336"><said direct="true">"What have you been telling her to do,"</said><said direct="false"> asked Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301337"><said direct="true">"Oh, anything. I recommended her to sit in the meadows, and throw stones and get her feet wet. It's not affectation at all in her, she really is hopelessly bored. It's as easy for her to be bored as for me not to be. Jack, what will you do to me if I get bored when we're married?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301338"><said direct="true">"I shall tell you to throw stones,"</said><said direct="false"> said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301339"><said direct="true">"As long as you don't look at me reproachfully,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "I sha'n't mind. Oh, look at the Matterhorn. Isn't it big?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301340"><said direct="true">"I don't like it,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack; "it always looks as if it was taking notice, and reflecting how dreadfully small one is."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301341"><said direct="true">"I used to think Vivy was like that,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "She was very good to me once or twice. I wonder what I shall be like when I'm middle-aged. I can't bear the thought of getting old, but that won't stop it. I don't want to sit by the fire and purr. I don't think I could do it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301342"><said direct="true">"One won't get old all of a sudden, though,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack; "that's a great consideration. The change will come so gradually that one won't know it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301343"><said direct="true">"Ah, don't,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo quickly. "It's like dying by inches, losing hold of life gradually. It won't come to me like that. I shall wake up some morning and find I'm not young any more."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301344"><said direct="true">"Well, it won't come yet,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack with sympathy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301345"><said direct="true">"Well, I'm not going to bother my head about it,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "there isn't time. There's Maud and her little Spencer. He's a dear little man, and he ought to be put in a band-box with some pink cotton-wool, and taken out every Sunday morning."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301346"><said direct="false">Dodo whistled shrilly on her fingers to attract their attention.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301347"><said direct="false">Mr. Spencer had been gathering flowers and putting them into a neat, little tin box, which he slung over his shoulders. He was dressed in a Norfolk jacket carefully buttoned round his waist, with knickerbockers and blue worsted stockings. He wore a small blue ribbon in his top button-hole, and a soft felt hat. He carried his flowers home in the evening, and always remembered to press them before he went to bed. He and Maud were sitting on a large grey rock by the wayside, reading the Psalms for the seventeenth evening of the month.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301348"><said direct="false">Dodo surveyed her critically, and laid herself out to be agreeable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301349"><said direct="true">"Well, Algy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "how are the flowers going on? Oh, what a sweet little gentian. Where did you get it? We're going to have some theatricals this evening, and you must come. It's going to be a charade, and you'll have to guess the word afterwards. Jack and I are going to look at the sunset. We shall be late for dinner. What's that book, Maud?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301350"><said direct="true">"We were reading the Psalms for the evening,"</said><said direct="false"> said Maud.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301351"><said direct="true">"Oh, how dear of you!"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "What a lovely church this makes. Algy, why don't you have service out of doors at Gloucester? I always feel so much more devotional on fine evenings out in the open air. I think that's charming. Good-bye. Jack and I must go on."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301352"><said direct="false">Dodo was a good walker, and they were soon among the pines that climb up the long steep slope to the Eiffel. Their steps were silent on the carpet of needles, and they walked on, not talking much, but each intensely conscious of the presence of the other. At a corner high up on the slope they stopped, for the great range in front of them had risen above the hills on the other side of the valley, and all the snow was flushed with the sunset.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301353"><said direct="false">Dodo laid her hand on Jack's.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301354"><said direct="true">"How odd it is that you and I should be here together, and like this,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I often used to wonder years ago whether this would happen. Jack, you will make me very happy? Promise me that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301355"><said direct="false">And Jack promised.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301356"><said direct="true">"I often think of Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> Dodo went on. "He wished for this, you know. He told me so as he was dying. Did you ever know, Jack—" even Dodo found it hard to get on at this moment—"did you ever know—he knew all? I began to tell him, and he stopped me, saying he knew."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301357"><said direct="false">Jack's face was grave.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301358"><said direct="true">"He told me he knew,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "at least, I saw he did. I never felt so much ashamed. It was my fault. I would have given a great deal to save him that knowledge."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301359"><said direct="true">"God forgive me if I was cruel to him,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "But, oh, Jack, I did try. I was mad that night I think."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301360"><said direct="true">"Don't talk of it,"</said><said direct="false"> said he suddenly; "it was horrible; it was shameful."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301361"><said direct="false">They were silent a moment. Then Jack said,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301362"><said direct="true">"Dodo, let us bury the thought of that for ever. There are some memories which are sacred to me. The memory of Chesterford is one. He was very faithful, and he was very unhappy. I feel as if I was striking his dead body when you speak of it. Requiescat."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301363"><said direct="false">They rose and went down to the hotel; the sun had set, and it grew suddenly cold.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301364"><said direct="false">The theatricals that night were a great success. Dodo was simply inimitable. Two maiden ladies left the hotel the next morning.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301365"><said direct="false">Dodo's marriage was announced in September. It was to be celebrated at the beginning of December, and was to be very grand indeed. Duchesses were expected to be nothing accounted of. She was still in Switzerland when it was made known, and events had developed themselves. The announcement came out in the following manner. She had taken her moonlight walk, but not with Prince Waldenech. She had mentioned to him incidentally that Jack was coming as well, and after dinner the Prince found he had important despatches waiting for him. Dodo was rather amused at the inadequacy of this statement, as no post had come in that morning. The thought that the Prince particularly wished to take a romantic walk with her was entertaining. Next morning, however, while Dodo was sitting in her room, looking out over the wide, green valley, her maid came in and asked if Prince Waldenech might have permission to speak to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301366"><said direct="true">"Good morning,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo affably, as he entered. "I wish you had been with us last night. We had a charming walk, but Jack was dreadfully dull. Why didn't you come?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301367"><said direct="false">The Prince twisted his long moustaches.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301368"><said direct="true">"Certainly I had no despatches,"</said><said direct="false"> he declared with frankness; "that was—how do you call it?—oh, a white lie."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301369"><said direct="true">"Did you expect me to believe it?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301370"><said direct="true">"Assuredly not,"</said><said direct="false"> he returned. "It would have been an insult to your understanding. But such statements are better than the truth sometimes. But I came here for another purpose—to say good-bye."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301371"><said direct="true">"You're not going?"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo surprisedly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301372"><said direct="true">"Unless you tell me to stop,"</said><said direct="false"> he murmured, advancing to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301373"><said direct="false">Dodo read his meaning at once, and determined to stop his saying anything more.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301374"><said direct="true">"Certainly I tell you to stop,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You mustn't break up our charming party so soon. Besides, I have a piece of news for you this morning. I ask for your congratulations."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301375"><said direct="true">"Ah, those despatches,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured the Prince.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301376"><said direct="true">"No, it was not the fault of your despatches,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, laughing. "It was settled some time ago. I shall be Lady Chesterford again next year. Allow me to introduce the Marchioness of Chesterford elect to your Highness," and she swept him a little curtsey.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301377"><said direct="false">The Prince bowed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301378"><said direct="true">"The Marquis of Chesterford is a very fortunate man,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Decidedly I had better go away to-morrow."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301379"><said direct="false">Dodo felt annoyed with him. "I thought he was clever enough not to say that," she thought to herself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301380"><said direct="true">"No, my dear Prince, you shall do nothing of the sort,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You are very happy here, and I don't choose that you should go away—I tell you to stop. You said you would if I told you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301381"><said direct="true">"I am a man of honour still,"</said><said direct="false"> said he, with mock solemnity. He put both hands together and bowed. "I shall be the first to congratulate the Marquis," he said, "and may I hope the Marchioness will think with pity on those less fortunate than he."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301382"><said direct="false">Dodo smiled benignantly. He really had got excellent manners. The scene was artistic, and it pleased her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301383"><said direct="true">"I should think you were too proud to accept pity,"</said><said direct="false"> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301384"><said direct="true">"Have you ever seen me other than humble—to you?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301385"><said direct="true">"Take it then,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "as much as your case requires. But I feel it is insolent of me to offer it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301386"><said direct="true">"I take all the pity you have,"</said><said direct="false"> said he, smiling gravely. "I want it more than any other poor devil you might think of bestowing it on."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301387"><said direct="false">He bowed himself gracefully out of the room. He and Dodo had been discussing English proverbs the day before, and Dodo asserted broadly that they were all founded on universal truths. The Prince thought that pity was quite a promising gift.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301388"><said direct="false">Dodo was a little uneasy after he had gone. She was always a trifle afraid of him, though, to do her justice, no one would have guessed it. He had acted the rejected lover in the theatricals of the week before, and his acting had been rather too good. The scene she had just gone through reminded her very forcibly of it. She had found that she could not get the play out of her head afterwards, and had had long waking dreams that night, in which the Prince appeared time after time, and her refusal got more faint as he pressed his suit. She felt that he was the stronger of the two, and such a scene as the last inspired her with a kind of self-distrust. "He will not make himself 'cheap,'" Dodo said to herself. She was very glad he was going to stop, and had been surprised to feel how annoyed she was when he said he had come to wish good-bye. But she felt he had a certain power over her, and did not quite like it. She would take Jack out for a walk and make things even. Jack had no power over her, and she thought complacently how she could turn him round her little finger. Dear old Jack! What a good time they were going to have.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301389"><said direct="false">She went downstairs and met the Prince and Jack on the verandah. The former was murmuring congratulatory speeches, and Jack was saying "Thanks awfully" at intervals. He had once said to Dodo that the Prince was "an oily devil," which was putting it rather strongly. Dodo had stuck up for him. "You only say he's oily," she said, "because he's got much better manners than you, and can come into the room without looking ridiculous, and I rather like devils as a rule, and him in particular, though I don't say he is one. Anyhow he is a friend of mine, and you can talk about something else."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301390"><said direct="false">Jack followed Dodo into the square, and sat down by her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301391"><said direct="true">"What made you tell that chap that we were engaged?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301392"><said direct="true">"Oh, I had excellent reasons,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301393"><said direct="false">The memory of the interview was still rather strong in her mind, and she felt not quite sure of herself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301394"><said direct="true">"No doubt,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack; "but I wish you'd tell me what they were."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301395"><said direct="true">"Don't talk as if you were the inquisition, old boy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I don't see why I should tell you if I don't like."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301396"><said direct="true">"Please yourself,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack crossly, and got up to walk away.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301397"><said direct="true">"Jack, behave this minute,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Apologise instantly for speaking like that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301398"><said direct="true">"I beg its little pardon,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack contentedly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301399"><said direct="false">He liked being hauled over the coals by Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301400"><said direct="true">"That's right; now, if you'll be good, I'll tell you. Has he gone quite away?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301401"><said direct="true">"Quite; thank goodness,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301402"><said direct="true">"Well,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "I told him because he was just going to propose to me himself, and I wanted to stop him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301403"><said direct="true">"Nasty brute,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack. "I hope you gave it him hot."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301404"><said direct="true">"That's a very rude thing to say, Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> said she. "It argues excellent taste in him. Besides, you did it yourself. Nasty brute!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301405"><said direct="true">"What right has he got to propose to you, I should like to know?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301406"><said direct="true">"Just as much as you had."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301407"><said direct="true">"Then I ought to be kicked for doing it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301408"><said direct="false">Dodo applied the toe of a muddy shoe to Jack's calf.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301409"><said direct="true">"Now, I've dirtied your pretty stockings,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Serves you right for proposing to me. How dare you, you nasty brute!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301410"><said direct="false">Jack made a grab at her foot, and made his fingers dirty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301411"><said direct="true">"Jack, behave,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "there are two thousand people looking."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301412"><said direct="true">"Let them look,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack recklessly. "I'm not going to be kicked in broad daylight within shouting distance of the hotel. Dodo, if you kick me again I shall call for help."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301413"><said direct="true">"Call away,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301414"><said direct="false">Jack opened his mouth and howled. An old gentleman, who was just folding his paper into a convenient form for reading, on a seat opposite, put on his spectacles and stared at them in blank amazement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301415"><said direct="true">"I told you I would,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Jack parenthetically, "It's only Lord Chesterford," exclaimed Dodo, in a shrill, treble voice, to the old gentleman. "I don't think he's very well. I daresay it's nothing."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301416"><said direct="true">"Most distressin',"</said><said direct="false"> said the old gentleman, in a tone of the deepest sarcasm, returning to his paper.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301417"><said direct="true">"Most distressin',"</said><said direct="false"> echoed Dodo pianissimo to Jack, who was laughing in a hopeless internal manner.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301418"><said direct="false">Dodo led him speechless away, and they wandered off to the little, low wall that separates the street from the square.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301419"><said direct="true">"Now, we'll go on talking,"</said><said direct="false">, said Jack, when he had recovered somewhat. "We were talking about that Austrian. What did you say to him?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301420"><said direct="true">"Oh, I've told you. I simply stopped him asking me by telling him I was going to marry someone else."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301421"><said direct="true">"What did he say then?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301422"><said direct="true">"Oh, he asked me for sympathy,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301423"><said direct="true">"Which you gave him?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301424"><said direct="true">"Certainly,"</said><said direct="false"> she answered. "I was very sorry for him, and I told him so; but we did it very nicely and politely, without stating anything, but only hinting at it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301425"><said direct="true">"A nasty, vicious, oily brute,"</said><said direct="false"> observed Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301426"><said direct="true">"Jack, you're ridiculous,"</said><said direct="false"> said she; "he's nothing of the sort. I've told him to come and see us when we're in England, and you'll have to be very polite and charming to him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301427"><said direct="true">"Oh, he can come then,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, "but I don't like him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301428"><said direct="false">They strolled down the street towards the church, and Dodo insisted on buying several entirely useless brackets, with chamois horns stuck aimlessly about them.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301429"><said direct="true">"I haven't got any money,"</said><said direct="false"> she observed. "Fork up, Jack. Seven and eight are fifteen and seven are twenty-two. Thanks."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301430"><said direct="false">Dodo was dissatisfied with one of her brackets before they reached the hotel again, and presented it to Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301431"><said direct="true">"It's awfully good of you,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "do you mean that you only owe me fifteen?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301432"><said direct="true">"Only fourteen,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "this was eight francs. It will be very useful to you, and when you look at it, you can think of me," she observed with feeling.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301433"><said direct="true">"I'd sooner have my eight francs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301434"><said direct="true">"Then you just won't get them,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, with finality; "and you sha'n't have that unless you say, 'Thank you.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301435"><said direct="false">The verandah was empty, as lunch had begun; so Jack said, "Thank you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301436"><said direct="false">The news of their engagement soon got about the hotel, and caused a much more favourable view to be taken of Dodo's behaviour to Jack, in the minds of the hostile camp. "Of course, if she was engaged to Lord Chesterford all along," said the enemy, "it puts her conduct in an entirely different light. They say he's immensely rich, and we hope we shall meet them in London. Her acting the other night was really extremely clever."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301437"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vane gave quite a number of select little teas on the verandah to the penitent, and showed her teeth most graciously. "Darling Dodo, of course it's a great happiness to me," she would say, "and the Marquis is such a very old friend of ours. So charming, isn't he? Yes. And they are simply devoted to each other."—The speeches seemed quite familiar still to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301438"><said direct="false">Dodo regarded the sudden change in the minds of the "shocked section" with much amusement. "It appears I'm quite proper after all," she thought. "That's a blessing anyhow. The colonial bishop will certainly ask me to share his mitre, now he knows I'm a good girl."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301439"><said direct="true">"Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> she called out to him as he passed, "you said the salon smelled like a church this morning. Well, it's only me. I diffuse an odour of sanctity, I find."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301440"><said direct="false">The Princess expressed her opinions on the engagement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301441"><said direct="true">"I'm sorry that you can't marry my brother,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You would have suited him admirably, and it would have been only natural for you to stay with your brother-in-law. What shall I give you for a wedding present? There's the bear-skin prayer-book, if you like. Waldenech is very cross about it. He says you told him he mightn't go away, so he has to stop. Are you going out on the picnic? Waldenech's getting up a picnic. He's ordered champagne. Do you think it will be amusing? They will drink the health of you and Lord Chesterford. If you'll promise to reply in suitable terms I'll come. Why didn't you come and see me this morning? I suppose you were engaged. Of course my brother was proposing to you after breakfast, and then you had to go and talk to your young man. Come to the picnic, Dodo. You shall show me how to throw stones."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301442"><said direct="false">They were going to walk up to a sufficiently remote spot in the rising ground to the east of Zermatt, and find their lunch ready for them. The Prince had no sympathy with meat sandwiches and a little sherry out of a flask, and his sister had expressed her antipathy to fresh eggs; so he had told the hotel-keeper that lunch would be wanted, and that there were to be no hard-boiled eggs and no sandwiches, and plenty of deck-chairs.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301443"><said direct="false">The Princess firmly refused to walk as far, and ordered what she said "was less unlike a horse than the others"; and asked Dodo to wait for her, as she knew she wouldn't be in time. She was one of those people who find it quite impossible to be punctual at whatever time she had an engagement. She was always twenty minutes late, but, as Dodo remarked, "That's the same thing as being punctual when people know you. I think punctuality is a necessity," she added, "more than a virtue."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301444"><said direct="true">"Haven't you got a proverb about making a virtue of necessity?"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess vaguely. "That's what I do on the rare occasions on which I am punctual. All my virtues are the result of necessity, which is another word for inclination."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301445"><said direct="true">"Yes, inclination is necessity when it's sufficiently strong,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "consequently, even when it's weak, it's still got a touch of necessity about it. That really is a comfortable doctrine. I shall remember that next time I want not to go to church."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301446"><said direct="true">"My husband is a very devout Roman Catholic,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked the Princess. "He's got an admirable plan of managing such things. First of all, he does what his conscience—he's got a very fine conscience—tells him he shouldn't. It must be very amusing to have a conscience. You need never feel lonely. Then he goes and confesses, which makes it all right, and to make himself quite safe he gives a hundred roubles to the poor. He's very rich, you know; it doesn't matter to him a bit. That gets him an indulgence. I fancy he's minus about six weeks' purgatory. He's got a balance. I expect he'll give it me. You have to be very rich to have a balance. He pays for his pleasures down in hard cash, you see; it's much better than running up a bill. He is very anxious about my spiritual welfare sometimes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301447"><said direct="true">"Does he really believe all that?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301448"><said direct="true">"Dear me, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "He has a most childlike faith. If the priest told him there was an eligible building site in heaven going cheap, he'd buy it at once. Personally I don't believe all those things. They don't seem to me in the least probable."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301449"><said direct="true">"What do you believe?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301450"><said direct="true">"Oh, I've got plenty of beliefs,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "I believe it's wiser being good than bad, and fitter being sane than mad. I don't do obviously low things, I am sorry for the poor devils of this world, I'm not mean, I'm not coarse, I don't care about taking an unfair advantage of other people. My taste revolts against immorality; I should as soon think of going about with dirty nails. If I believed what the priests tell me I should be a very good woman, according to their lights. As it is, though my conduct in all matters of right and wrong is identical with what it would be, I'm one of the lost."</said></p>

<sample><p n="ENG189301317"><said direct="true">"Oh, but you can't see it from here,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "That great mass of mountain is in the way."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301318"><said direct="false">The Princess considered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301319"><said direct="true">"I don't think I want to see the sunset after all,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I've just found the Kreutzer Sonata. I've been rural enough for one day, and I want a breath of civilised air. Do you know, I never feel bored when you are talking to me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301320"><said direct="true">"Oh, that's part of my charm, isn't it?"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo to Jack, who had lounged up to where they were sitting.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301321"><said direct="true">"Dodo's been lecturing me, Lord Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "Does she ever lecture you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301322"><said direct="true">"She gave me quite a long lecture once,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "She recommended me to live in a cathedral town."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301323"><said direct="true">"A cathedral town,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "That's something fearful, isn't it? Why did you tell him to do that?" she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301324"><said direct="true">"I think it was a mistake,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Anyhow, Jack didn't take my advice. I shouldn't recommend him to do it now, but he has a perfect genius for being domestic. Everyone is very domestic in cathedral towns. They all dine at seven and breakfast at a quarter past eight—next morning, you understand. That quarter past is delightful. But Jack said he didn't want to score small successes," she added, employing a figure grammatically known as "hiatus."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301325"><said direct="true">"My husband is very domestic,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "But he isn't a bit like Lord Chesterford. He would like to live with me in a little house in the country, and never have anyone to stay with us. That would be so cheerful during the winter months."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301326"><said direct="true">"Jack, would you like to live with your wife in a little house in the country?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301327"><said direct="true">"I don't think I should ever marry a woman who wanted to,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Jack, meeting Dodo's glance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301328"><said direct="true">"Imagine two people really liking each other better than all the rest of the world,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess, "and living on milk, and love, and wild roses, and fresh eggs! I can't bear fresh eggs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301329"><said direct="true">"My egg this morning wasn't at all fresh,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I wish I'd thought of sending it to your room."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301330"><said direct="true">"Would you never get tired of your wife, don't you think,"</said><said direct="false"> continued the Princess, "if you shut yourselves up in the country? Supposing she wished to pick roses when you wanted to play lawn tennis?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301331"><said direct="true">"Oh, Jack, it wouldn't do,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You'd make her play lawn tennis."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301332"><said direct="true">"My husband and I never thought of playing lawn tennis,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "I shall try that when we meet next. It's very amusing, isn't it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301333"><said direct="true">"It makes you die of laughing,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, solemnly. "Come, Jack, we're going to see the sunset. Good-bye, dear. Go and play with your maid. She can go out of the room while you think of something, and then come in and guess what you've thought of."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301334"><said direct="false">Jack and Dodo strolled up through the sweet-smelling meadows towards the Riffelberg. A cool breeze was streaming down from the "furrow cloven alls" of the glacier, heavy with the clean smell of pine woods and summer flowers, and thick with a hundred mingling sounds. The cows were being driven homewards, and the faint sounds of bells were carried down to them from the green heights above. Now and then they passed a herd of goats, still nibbling anxiously at the wayside grass, followed by some small ragged shepherd, who brushed his long hair away from his eyes to get a better look at this dazzling, fair-skinned woman, who evidently belonged to quite another order of beings from his wrinkled, early-old mother. One of them held out to Dodo a wilted little bunch of flowers, crumpled with much handling, but she did not seem to notice him. After they had passed he tossed them away, and ran off after his straying flock. Southwards, high above them, stretched the long lines of snow spread out under the feet of the Matterhorn, which sat like some huge sphinx, unapproachable, remote. Just below lay the village, sleeping in the last rays of the sun, which shone warmly on the red, weathered planks. Light blue smoke curled slowly up from the shingled roofs, and streamed gently down the valley in a thin, transparent haze.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301335"><said direct="true">"Decidedly, it's a very nice world,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I'm so glad I wasn't born a Russian. The Princess never enjoys anything at all, except telling one how bored she is. But she's very amusing, and I gave her a great deal of good advice."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301336"><said direct="true">"What have you been telling her to do,"</said><said direct="false"> asked Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301337"><said direct="true">"Oh, anything. I recommended her to sit in the meadows, and throw stones and get her feet wet. It's not affectation at all in her, she really is hopelessly bored. It's as easy for her to be bored as for me not to be. Jack, what will you do to me if I get bored when we're married?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301338"><said direct="true">"I shall tell you to throw stones,"</said><said direct="false"> said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301339"><said direct="true">"As long as you don't look at me reproachfully,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "I sha'n't mind. Oh, look at the Matterhorn. Isn't it big?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301340"><said direct="true">"I don't like it,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack; "it always looks as if it was taking notice, and reflecting how dreadfully small one is."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301341"><said direct="true">"I used to think Vivy was like that,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "She was very good to me once or twice. I wonder what I shall be like when I'm middle-aged. I can't bear the thought of getting old, but that won't stop it. I don't want to sit by the fire and purr. I don't think I could do it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301342"><said direct="true">"One won't get old all of a sudden, though,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack; "that's a great consideration. The change will come so gradually that one won't know it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301343"><said direct="true">"Ah, don't,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo quickly. "It's like dying by inches, losing hold of life gradually. It won't come to me like that. I shall wake up some morning and find I'm not young any more."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301344"><said direct="true">"Well, it won't come yet,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack with sympathy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301345"><said direct="true">"Well, I'm not going to bother my head about it,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "there isn't time. There's Maud and her little Spencer. He's a dear little man, and he ought to be put in a band-box with some pink cotton-wool, and taken out every Sunday morning."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301346"><said direct="false">Dodo whistled shrilly on her fingers to attract their attention.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301347"><said direct="false">Mr. Spencer had been gathering flowers and putting them into a neat, little tin box, which he slung over his shoulders. He was dressed in a Norfolk jacket carefully buttoned round his waist, with knickerbockers and blue worsted stockings. He wore a small blue ribbon in his top button-hole, and a soft felt hat. He carried his flowers home in the evening, and always remembered to press them before he went to bed. He and Maud were sitting on a large grey rock by the wayside, reading the Psalms for the seventeenth evening of the month.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301348"><said direct="false">Dodo surveyed her critically, and laid herself out to be agreeable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301349"><said direct="true">"Well, Algy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "how are the flowers going on? Oh, what a sweet little gentian. Where did you get it? We're going to have some theatricals this evening, and you must come. It's going to be a charade, and you'll have to guess the word afterwards. Jack and I are going to look at the sunset. We shall be late for dinner. What's that book, Maud?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301350"><said direct="true">"We were reading the Psalms for the evening,"</said><said direct="false"> said Maud.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301351"><said direct="true">"Oh, how dear of you!"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "What a lovely church this makes. Algy, why don't you have service out of doors at Gloucester? I always feel so much more devotional on fine evenings out in the open air. I think that's charming. Good-bye. Jack and I must go on."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301352"><said direct="false">Dodo was a good walker, and they were soon among the pines that climb up the long steep slope to the Eiffel. Their steps were silent on the carpet of needles, and they walked on, not talking much, but each intensely conscious of the presence of the other. At a corner high up on the slope they stopped, for the great range in front of them had risen above the hills on the other side of the valley, and all the snow was flushed with the sunset.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301353"><said direct="false">Dodo laid her hand on Jack's.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301354"><said direct="true">"How odd it is that you and I should be here together, and like this,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I often used to wonder years ago whether this would happen. Jack, you will make me very happy? Promise me that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301355"><said direct="false">And Jack promised.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301356"><said direct="true">"I often think of Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> Dodo went on. "He wished for this, you know. He told me so as he was dying. Did you ever know, Jack—" even Dodo found it hard to get on at this moment—"did you ever know—he knew all? I began to tell him, and he stopped me, saying he knew."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301357"><said direct="false">Jack's face was grave.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301358"><said direct="true">"He told me he knew,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "at least, I saw he did. I never felt so much ashamed. It was my fault. I would have given a great deal to save him that knowledge."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301359"><said direct="true">"God forgive me if I was cruel to him,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "But, oh, Jack, I did try. I was mad that night I think."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301360"><said direct="true">"Don't talk of it,"</said><said direct="false"> said he suddenly; "it was horrible; it was shameful."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301361"><said direct="false">They were silent a moment. Then Jack said,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301362"><said direct="true">"Dodo, let us bury the thought of that for ever. There are some memories which are sacred to me. The memory of Chesterford is one. He was very faithful, and he was very unhappy. I feel as if I was striking his dead body when you speak of it. Requiescat."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301363"><said direct="false">They rose and went down to the hotel; the sun had set, and it grew suddenly cold.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301364"><said direct="false">The theatricals that night were a great success. Dodo was simply inimitable. Two maiden ladies left the hotel the next morning.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301365"><said direct="false">Dodo's marriage was announced in September. It was to be celebrated at the beginning of December, and was to be very grand indeed. Duchesses were expected to be nothing accounted of. She was still in Switzerland when it was made known, and events had developed themselves. The announcement came out in the following manner. She had taken her moonlight walk, but not with Prince Waldenech. She had mentioned to him incidentally that Jack was coming as well, and after dinner the Prince found he had important despatches waiting for him. Dodo was rather amused at the inadequacy of this statement, as no post had come in that morning. The thought that the Prince particularly wished to take a romantic walk with her was entertaining. Next morning, however, while Dodo was sitting in her room, looking out over the wide, green valley, her maid came in and asked if Prince Waldenech might have permission to speak to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301366"><said direct="true">"Good morning,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo affably, as he entered. "I wish you had been with us last night. We had a charming walk, but Jack was dreadfully dull. Why didn't you come?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301367"><said direct="false">The Prince twisted his long moustaches.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301368"><said direct="true">"Certainly I had no despatches,"</said><said direct="false"> he declared with frankness; "that was—how do you call it?—oh, a white lie."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301369"><said direct="true">"Did you expect me to believe it?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301370"><said direct="true">"Assuredly not,"</said><said direct="false"> he returned. "It would have been an insult to your understanding. But such statements are better than the truth sometimes. But I came here for another purpose—to say good-bye."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301371"><said direct="true">"You're not going?"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo surprisedly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301372"><said direct="true">"Unless you tell me to stop,"</said><said direct="false"> he murmured, advancing to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301373"><said direct="false">Dodo read his meaning at once, and determined to stop his saying anything more.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301374"><said direct="true">"Certainly I tell you to stop,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You mustn't break up our charming party so soon. Besides, I have a piece of news for you this morning. I ask for your congratulations."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301375"><said direct="true">"Ah, those despatches,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured the Prince.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301376"><said direct="true">"No, it was not the fault of your despatches,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, laughing. "It was settled some time ago. I shall be Lady Chesterford again next year. Allow me to introduce the Marchioness of Chesterford elect to your Highness," and she swept him a little curtsey.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301377"><said direct="false">The Prince bowed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301378"><said direct="true">"The Marquis of Chesterford is a very fortunate man,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Decidedly I had better go away to-morrow."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301379"><said direct="false">Dodo felt annoyed with him. "I thought he was clever enough not to say that," she thought to herself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301380"><said direct="true">"No, my dear Prince, you shall do nothing of the sort,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You are very happy here, and I don't choose that you should go away—I tell you to stop. You said you would if I told you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301381"><said direct="true">"I am a man of honour still,"</said><said direct="false"> said he, with mock solemnity. He put both hands together and bowed. "I shall be the first to congratulate the Marquis," he said, "and may I hope the Marchioness will think with pity on those less fortunate than he."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301382"><said direct="false">Dodo smiled benignantly. He really had got excellent manners. The scene was artistic, and it pleased her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301383"><said direct="true">"I should think you were too proud to accept pity,"</said><said direct="false"> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301384"><said direct="true">"Have you ever seen me other than humble—to you?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301385"><said direct="true">"Take it then,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "as much as your case requires. But I feel it is insolent of me to offer it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301386"><said direct="true">"I take all the pity you have,"</said><said direct="false"> said he, smiling gravely. "I want it more than any other poor devil you might think of bestowing it on."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301387"><said direct="false">He bowed himself gracefully out of the room. He and Dodo had been discussing English proverbs the day before, and Dodo asserted broadly that they were all founded on universal truths. The Prince thought that pity was quite a promising gift.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301388"><said direct="false">Dodo was a little uneasy after he had gone. She was always a trifle afraid of him, though, to do her justice, no one would have guessed it. He had acted the rejected lover in the theatricals of the week before, and his acting had been rather too good. The scene she had just gone through reminded her very forcibly of it. She had found that she could not get the play out of her head afterwards, and had had long waking dreams that night, in which the Prince appeared time after time, and her refusal got more faint as he pressed his suit. She felt that he was the stronger of the two, and such a scene as the last inspired her with a kind of self-distrust. "He will not make himself 'cheap,'" Dodo said to herself. She was very glad he was going to stop, and had been surprised to feel how annoyed she was when he said he had come to wish good-bye. But she felt he had a certain power over her, and did not quite like it. She would take Jack out for a walk and make things even. Jack had no power over her, and she thought complacently how she could turn him round her little finger. Dear old Jack! What a good time they were going to have.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301389"><said direct="false">She went downstairs and met the Prince and Jack on the verandah. The former was murmuring congratulatory speeches, and Jack was saying "Thanks awfully" at intervals. He had once said to Dodo that the Prince was "an oily devil," which was putting it rather strongly. Dodo had stuck up for him. "You only say he's oily," she said, "because he's got much better manners than you, and can come into the room without looking ridiculous, and I rather like devils as a rule, and him in particular, though I don't say he is one. Anyhow he is a friend of mine, and you can talk about something else."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301390"><said direct="false">Jack followed Dodo into the square, and sat down by her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301391"><said direct="true">"What made you tell that chap that we were engaged?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301392"><said direct="true">"Oh, I had excellent reasons,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301393"><said direct="false">The memory of the interview was still rather strong in her mind, and she felt not quite sure of herself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301394"><said direct="true">"No doubt,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack; "but I wish you'd tell me what they were."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301395"><said direct="true">"Don't talk as if you were the inquisition, old boy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I don't see why I should tell you if I don't like."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301396"><said direct="true">"Please yourself,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack crossly, and got up to walk away.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301397"><said direct="true">"Jack, behave this minute,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Apologise instantly for speaking like that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301398"><said direct="true">"I beg its little pardon,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack contentedly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301399"><said direct="false">He liked being hauled over the coals by Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301400"><said direct="true">"That's right; now, if you'll be good, I'll tell you. Has he gone quite away?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301401"><said direct="true">"Quite; thank goodness,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301402"><said direct="true">"Well,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "I told him because he was just going to propose to me himself, and I wanted to stop him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301403"><said direct="true">"Nasty brute,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack. "I hope you gave it him hot."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301404"><said direct="true">"That's a very rude thing to say, Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> said she. "It argues excellent taste in him. Besides, you did it yourself. Nasty brute!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301405"><said direct="true">"What right has he got to propose to you, I should like to know?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301406"><said direct="true">"Just as much as you had."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301407"><said direct="true">"Then I ought to be kicked for doing it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301408"><said direct="false">Dodo applied the toe of a muddy shoe to Jack's calf.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301409"><said direct="true">"Now, I've dirtied your pretty stockings,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Serves you right for proposing to me. How dare you, you nasty brute!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301410"><said direct="false">Jack made a grab at her foot, and made his fingers dirty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301411"><said direct="true">"Jack, behave,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "there are two thousand people looking."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301412"><said direct="true">"Let them look,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack recklessly. "I'm not going to be kicked in broad daylight within shouting distance of the hotel. Dodo, if you kick me again I shall call for help."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301413"><said direct="true">"Call away,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301414"><said direct="false">Jack opened his mouth and howled. An old gentleman, who was just folding his paper into a convenient form for reading, on a seat opposite, put on his spectacles and stared at them in blank amazement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301415"><said direct="true">"I told you I would,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Jack parenthetically, "It's only Lord Chesterford," exclaimed Dodo, in a shrill, treble voice, to the old gentleman. "I don't think he's very well. I daresay it's nothing."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301416"><said direct="true">"Most distressin',"</said><said direct="false"> said the old gentleman, in a tone of the deepest sarcasm, returning to his paper.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301417"><said direct="true">"Most distressin',"</said><said direct="false"> echoed Dodo pianissimo to Jack, who was laughing in a hopeless internal manner.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301418"><said direct="false">Dodo led him speechless away, and they wandered off to the little, low wall that separates the street from the square.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301419"><said direct="true">"Now, we'll go on talking,"</said><said direct="false">, said Jack, when he had recovered somewhat. "We were talking about that Austrian. What did you say to him?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301420"><said direct="true">"Oh, I've told you. I simply stopped him asking me by telling him I was going to marry someone else."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301421"><said direct="true">"What did he say then?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301422"><said direct="true">"Oh, he asked me for sympathy,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301423"><said direct="true">"Which you gave him?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301424"><said direct="true">"Certainly,"</said><said direct="false"> she answered. "I was very sorry for him, and I told him so; but we did it very nicely and politely, without stating anything, but only hinting at it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301425"><said direct="true">"A nasty, vicious, oily brute,"</said><said direct="false"> observed Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301426"><said direct="true">"Jack, you're ridiculous,"</said><said direct="false"> said she; "he's nothing of the sort. I've told him to come and see us when we're in England, and you'll have to be very polite and charming to him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301427"><said direct="true">"Oh, he can come then,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, "but I don't like him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301428"><said direct="false">They strolled down the street towards the church, and Dodo insisted on buying several entirely useless brackets, with chamois horns stuck aimlessly about them.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301429"><said direct="true">"I haven't got any money,"</said><said direct="false"> she observed. "Fork up, Jack. Seven and eight are fifteen and seven are twenty-two. Thanks."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301430"><said direct="false">Dodo was dissatisfied with one of her brackets before they reached the hotel again, and presented it to Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301431"><said direct="true">"It's awfully good of you,"</said><said direct="false"> said he; "do you mean that you only owe me fifteen?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301432"><said direct="true">"Only fourteen,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "this was eight francs. It will be very useful to you, and when you look at it, you can think of me," she observed with feeling.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301433"><said direct="true">"I'd sooner have my eight francs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301434"><said direct="true">"Then you just won't get them,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, with finality; "and you sha'n't have that unless you say, 'Thank you.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301435"><said direct="false">The verandah was empty, as lunch had begun; so Jack said, "Thank you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301436"><said direct="false">The news of their engagement soon got about the hotel, and caused a much more favourable view to be taken of Dodo's behaviour to Jack, in the minds of the hostile camp. "Of course, if she was engaged to Lord Chesterford all along," said the enemy, "it puts her conduct in an entirely different light. They say he's immensely rich, and we hope we shall meet them in London. Her acting the other night was really extremely clever."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301437"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vane gave quite a number of select little teas on the verandah to the penitent, and showed her teeth most graciously. "Darling Dodo, of course it's a great happiness to me," she would say, "and the Marquis is such a very old friend of ours. So charming, isn't he? Yes. And they are simply devoted to each other."—The speeches seemed quite familiar still to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301438"><said direct="false">Dodo regarded the sudden change in the minds of the "shocked section" with much amusement. "It appears I'm quite proper after all," she thought. "That's a blessing anyhow. The colonial bishop will certainly ask me to share his mitre, now he knows I'm a good girl."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301439"><said direct="true">"Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> she called out to him as he passed, "you said the salon smelled like a church this morning. Well, it's only me. I diffuse an odour of sanctity, I find."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301440"><said direct="false">The Princess expressed her opinions on the engagement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301441"><said direct="true">"I'm sorry that you can't marry my brother,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You would have suited him admirably, and it would have been only natural for you to stay with your brother-in-law. What shall I give you for a wedding present? There's the bear-skin prayer-book, if you like. Waldenech is very cross about it. He says you told him he mightn't go away, so he has to stop. Are you going out on the picnic? Waldenech's getting up a picnic. He's ordered champagne. Do you think it will be amusing? They will drink the health of you and Lord Chesterford. If you'll promise to reply in suitable terms I'll come. Why didn't you come and see me this morning? I suppose you were engaged. Of course my brother was proposing to you after breakfast, and then you had to go and talk to your young man. Come to the picnic, Dodo. You shall show me how to throw stones."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301442"><said direct="false">They were going to walk up to a sufficiently remote spot in the rising ground to the east of Zermatt, and find their lunch ready for them. The Prince had no sympathy with meat sandwiches and a little sherry out of a flask, and his sister had expressed her antipathy to fresh eggs; so he had told the hotel-keeper that lunch would be wanted, and that there were to be no hard-boiled eggs and no sandwiches, and plenty of deck-chairs.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301443"><said direct="false">The Princess firmly refused to walk as far, and ordered what she said "was less unlike a horse than the others"; and asked Dodo to wait for her, as she knew she wouldn't be in time. She was one of those people who find it quite impossible to be punctual at whatever time she had an engagement. She was always twenty minutes late, but, as Dodo remarked, "That's the same thing as being punctual when people know you. I think punctuality is a necessity," she added, "more than a virtue."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301444"><said direct="true">"Haven't you got a proverb about making a virtue of necessity?"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess vaguely. "That's what I do on the rare occasions on which I am punctual. All my virtues are the result of necessity, which is another word for inclination."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301445"><said direct="true">"Yes, inclination is necessity when it's sufficiently strong,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "consequently, even when it's weak, it's still got a touch of necessity about it. That really is a comfortable doctrine. I shall remember that next time I want not to go to church."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301446"><said direct="true">"My husband is a very devout Roman Catholic,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked the Princess. "He's got an admirable plan of managing such things. First of all, he does what his conscience—he's got a very fine conscience—tells him he shouldn't. It must be very amusing to have a conscience. You need never feel lonely. Then he goes and confesses, which makes it all right, and to make himself quite safe he gives a hundred roubles to the poor. He's very rich, you know; it doesn't matter to him a bit. That gets him an indulgence. I fancy he's minus about six weeks' purgatory. He's got a balance. I expect he'll give it me. You have to be very rich to have a balance. He pays for his pleasures down in hard cash, you see; it's much better than running up a bill. He is very anxious about my spiritual welfare sometimes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301447"><said direct="true">"Does he really believe all that?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301448"><said direct="true">"Dear me, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "He has a most childlike faith. If the priest told him there was an eligible building site in heaven going cheap, he'd buy it at once. Personally I don't believe all those things. They don't seem to me in the least probable."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301449"><said direct="true">"What do you believe?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301450"><said direct="true">"Oh, I've got plenty of beliefs,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "I believe it's wiser being good than bad, and fitter being sane than mad. I don't do obviously low things, I am sorry for the poor devils of this world, I'm not mean, I'm not coarse, I don't care about taking an unfair advantage of other people. My taste revolts against immorality; I should as soon think of going about with dirty nails. If I believed what the priests tell me I should be a very good woman, according to their lights. As it is, though my conduct in all matters of right and wrong is identical with what it would be, I'm one of the lost."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301451"><said direct="true">"English people are just as irrational in their way,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "only they don't do such things in cold blood. They appeal to little morbid emotions, excited by Sunday evening and slow tunes in four sharps. I went to a country church once, on a lovely summer evening, and we all sang, 'Hark, hark, my soul!' at the tops of our voices, and I walked home with my husband, feeling that I'd never do anything naughty any more, and Maud and her husband, and he and I, sang hymns after dinner. It was simply delicious. The world was going to be a different place ever afterwards, and I expected to die in the night. But I didn't, you know, and next morning all the difference was that I'd caught a cold sitting in a hayfield—and that was the end."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301452"><said direct="true">"No, it's no use,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "But I envy those who have 'the religion,' as they say in our country. It makes things so much easier."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301453"><said direct="true">"What I couldn't help wondering,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "was whether I should be any better if I had kept up the feeling of that Sunday night. I should have stopped at home singing hymns, I suppose, instead of going out to dinner; but what then? Should I have been less objectionable when things went wrong? Should I have been any kinder to—to anybody? I don't believe it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301454"><said direct="true">"Of course you wouldn't,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "You go about it the wrong way. We neither of us can help it, because we're not made like that. It would be as sensible to cultivate eccentricity in order to become a genius. People who have 'the religion' like singing hymns, but they didn't get the religion by singing hymns. They sing hymns because they've got it. What is so absurd is to suppose, as my husband does, that a hundred roubles at stated intervals produces salvation. That's his form of singing hymns, and the priests encourage him. I gave it up long ago. If I thought singing hymns or encouraging priests would do any good, I'd sell my diamonds and buy a harmonium, and give the rest away. But I don't think anything so absurd."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301455"><said direct="true">"David was so sensible,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I've got a great affection for David. He told his people to sing praises with understanding. You see you've got to understand it first. I wonder if he would have understood 'Hark, hark, my soul!' I didn't, but it made me feel good inside."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301456"><said direct="true">"Somebody said religion was morality touched with emotion,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Princess. "My husband hasn't got any morality, and his emotions are those excited by killing bears. Yet the priests say he's wonderfully religious."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301457"><said direct="true">"There's something wrong somewhere,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301458"><said direct="false">The party were waiting for them when they came up. The Prince led Dodo to a place next him, and the Princess sat next Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301459"><said direct="true">"I'm so sorry,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "I'm afraid we're dreadfully late."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301460"><said direct="true">"My sister is never in time,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Prince. "She kept the Emperor waiting half an hour once. His Imperial Majesty swore."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301461"><said direct="true">"Oh, you're doing me an injustice,"</said><said direct="false">, said she. "I was in time the other day."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301462"><said direct="true">"Let us do her justice,"</said><said direct="false"> said the Prince. "She was in time, but that was because she forgot what the time was."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301463"><said direct="true">"That's the cause of my being unpunctual, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked the Princess. "To-day it was also because the thing like a horse wouldn't go, and Dodo and I talked a good deal."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301464"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vane was eating her chicken with great satisfaction. A picnic with a Prince was so much capital to her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301465"><said direct="true">"I can't think why we don't all go and live in the country always,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "and have little picnics like this every day. Such a good idea of your Highness. So original—and such a charming day."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301466"><said direct="false">The Prince remarked that picnics were not his invention, and that the credit for the weather was due elsewhere.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301467"><said direct="true">"Oh, but you said last night you were sure it was going to be fine,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vane, floundering a little. "Dodo, dear, didn't you hear the Prince say so?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301468"><said direct="true">"Here's to the health of our Zadkiel,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "may his shadow, etc: Drink to old Zadkiel, Jack, the founder of the feast, who stands us champagne. I'll stand you a drink when you come to see us in England. His Serenity," she said, emptying her glass.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301469"><said direct="true">"What a lot of things I am,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured the Prince. "Don't forget I'm a poor devil whom you pity as well."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301470"><said direct="true">"Do you find pity a satisfactory diet?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo saucily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301471"><said direct="false">She was determined not to be frightened of him any more.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301472"><said direct="false">The Prince decided on a bold stroke.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301473"><said direct="true">"Pity is akin to love,"</said><said direct="false"> he said below his breath.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301474"><said direct="false">But he had found his match, for the time being, at any rate.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301475"><said direct="true">"Don't mistake it for it's cousin, then,"</said><said direct="false"> laughed Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301476"><said direct="false">The conversation became more general. The Princess said the mountains were too high and large, and she didn't like them. Jack remarked that it was purely a matter of degree, and the Princess explained that it was exactly what she meant, they were so much bigger than she was. Mr. Spencer plunged violently into the conversation, and said that Mount Everest was twice as high as the Matterhorn, and you never saw the top. The Princess said, "Oh," and Jack asked how they knew how high it was, if the top was never seen, and Mr. Spencer explained vaguely that they did it with sextants. Maud said she thought he meant theodolites, and Dodo asked a bad riddle about sextons. On the whole the picnic went off as well as could be expected, and Dodo determined to have lunch out of doors every day for the rest of her natural life.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301477"><said direct="false">After lunch Mr. Spencer and Maud wandered away to pick flowers, presumably. Mrs. Vane moved her chair into the shade, in such a position that she could command a view of the mountain, and fell asleep. Jack smoked a short black pipe, chiefly because the Prince offered him a cigar, and Dodo smoked cigarettes and ate cherries backwards, beginning with the stalk, and induced the Princess to do the same, receiving two seconds' start. "It's a form of throwing stones," Dodo explained. The "most distressin'" old gentleman was sighted under a large white umbrella, moving slowly up the path a little below them, and Dodo insisted on inviting him to lunch, as it was certain that he had just left the table d'hôte. "He thought it simply charming of me," she said, as she came back. "He's quite forgiven Jack for shouting. Besides, I took him the Princess's compliments. He's English, you know."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301478"><said direct="false">Edith had stayed on with the Granthams till nearly the end of August. She declined to have breakfast with the family, after she had been there about a week, because she said it spoiled her mornings, and used to breakfast by herself at seven or half-past, which gave her extra' two hours at her music; and Lady Grantham complained of being wakened in the middle of the night by funeral marches. So Edith promised to play with the soft pedal down, which she never did.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301479"><said direct="false">At lunch Sir Robert used to make a point of asking her how she had got on, and described to her the admirable band in the Casino at Monte Carlo. He was always extremely genial to her, and, when she played to them in the evening, he would beat time with one hand. Now and then he even told her that she was not playing staccato enough, or that he heard it taken rather quicker at Bayreuth.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301480"><said direct="false">Dodo had written to Edith saying that she was coming to stay with her in September, and that Edith must be at home by the second, because she would probably come that day or the third. Edith happened to mention this one night in the hearing of Lady Grantham, who had been firing off home-truths at her husband and son like a minute gun, in a low, scornful voice. This habit of hers was rather embarrassing at times. At dinner, for instance, that evening, when he had been airing his musical views to Edith as usual, she had suddenly said,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301481"><said direct="true">"You don't know how silly you're making yourself, Bob. Everyone knows that you can't distinguish one note from another!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301482"><said direct="false">Though Edith felt on fairly intimate terms with the family, there were occasions when she didn't quite know how to behave. She attempted to continue her conversation with the Baronet, but Lady Grantham would not allow it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301483"><said direct="true">"Edith, you know he doesn't know 'God save the Queen' when he hears it. You'll only make him conceited."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301484"><said direct="true">"She's only like this when she's here, Miss Staines,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Frank, alluding to his mother in the third person. "She's awfully polite when she's in London; she was to you the first week you were here, you know, but she can't keep it up. She's had a bad education. Poor dear!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301485"><said direct="true">"Oh, you are a queer family,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith sometimes. "You really ought to have no faults left, any of you, you are so wonderfully candid to each other."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301486"><said direct="true">"Some people think mother so charming,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Frank. "I never yet found out what her particular charm is."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301487"><said direct="false">On this occasion, when Edith mentioned that Dodo was coming to stay with her, Lady Grantham sounded truce at once, and left her unnatural offspring alone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301488"><said direct="true">"I wish you'd ask me to come and stay with you, too,"</said><said direct="false"> said she presently. "Bob and Frank will be going off partridge shooting all day, and Nora and I will be all alone, and they'll be sleepy in the evening, and snore in the drawing-room."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301489"><said direct="true">"I'd make her promise to be polite, Miss Staines,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Frank.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301490"><said direct="true">"I want to meet Lady Chesterford very much,"</said><said direct="false"> she continued. "I hear she is so charming. She's a friend of yours; isn't she, Nora? Why have you never asked her to stay here? What's the good of having friends if you don't trot them out?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301491"><said direct="true">"Oh, I've asked her more than once, mother,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham, "but she couldn't ever come."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301492"><said direct="true">"She's heard about ma at home,"</said><said direct="false"> said Frank.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301493"><said direct="true">"I'm backing you, Frank,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked the Baronet, who was still rather sore after his recent drubbing. "Go in and win, my boy."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301494"><said direct="true">"Bob, you shouldn't encourage Frank to be rude,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. "He's bad enough without that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301495"><said direct="true">"That's what comes of having a mamma with foreign manners. There's no word for 'thank you' in Spanish, is there, mother? Were you here with Charlie Broxton, Miss Staines? She told him he didn't brush his hair, or his teeth, and she hated little men. Charlie's five feet three. He was here as my friend."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301496"><said direct="true">"Do come,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith, when this skirmishing was over. "Nora will come with you, of course. We shall be only four. I don't suppose there will be anyone else at home."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301497"><said direct="true">"Hurrah,"</said><said direct="false"> said Frank, "we'll have a real good time, father. No nagging in the evenings. We won't dress, and we'll smoke in the drawing-room."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301498"><said direct="true">"I long to see Dodo again,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Miss Grantham. "She's one of the few people I never get at all tired of."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301499"><said direct="true">"I know her by sight,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. "She was talking very loud to Prince Waldenech when I saw her. It was at the Brettons'."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301500"><said direct="true">"Dodo can talk loud when she wants,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Miss Grantham. "Did you see her dance that night, mother? I believe she was splendid."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301501"><said direct="true">"She was doing nothing else,"</said><said direct="false"> replied Lady Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301502"><said direct="true">"Oh, but by herself,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "She took a select party away, and tucked up her skirts and sent them all into raptures."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301503"><said direct="true">"That's so like Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "She never does anything badly. If she does it at all, it's good of its kind."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301504"><said direct="true">"I should like to know her,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. The remark was characteristic.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301505"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham returned to the subject of Dodo in the course of the evening.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301506"><said direct="true">"Everyone says she is so supremely successful,"</said><said direct="false"> she said to Edith. "What's her method?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301507"><said direct="false">All successful people, according to Lady Grantham, had a method. They found out by experience what rôle suited them best, and they played it assiduously. To do her justice, there was a good deal of truth in it with regard to the people among whom she moved.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301508"><said direct="true">"Her method is purely to be dramatic, in the most unmistakable way,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith, after some consideration. "She is almost always picturesque. To all appearance her only method is to have no method. She seems to say and do anything that comes into her head, but all she says and does is rather striking. She can accommodate herself to nearly any circumstances. She is never colourless; and she is not quite like anybody else I ever met. She has an immense amount of vitality, and she is almost always doing something. It's hopeless to try and describe her; you will see. She is beautiful, unscrupulous, dramatic, warm-hearted, cold-blooded, and a hundred other things."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301509"><said direct="true">"Oh, you don't do her justice, Edith,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Miss Grantham. "She's much more than all that. She has got genius, or something very like it. I think Dodo gives me a better idea of the divine fire than anyone else."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301510"><said direct="true">"Then the divine fire resembles something not at all divine on occasions,"</said><said direct="false"> observed Edith. "I don't think that the divine fire talks so much nonsense either."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301511"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham got up.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301512"><said direct="true">"I expect to be disappointed,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Geniuses are nearly always badly dressed, or they wear spectacles, or they are very short. However, I shall come. Come, Nora, it's time to go to bed."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301513"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham never said "good-night" or "good-morning" to the members of her family. "They all sleep like hogs," she said, "and they are very cheerful in the morning. They get on quite well enough without my good wishes. It is very plebeian to be cheerful in the morning."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301514"><said direct="false">Although, as I have mentioned before, Sir Robert was an adept at choosing his conversation to suit his audience, there was one subject on which he considered that he might talk to anyone, and in which the whole world must necessarily take an intelligent and eager interest. The Romans used to worship the bones and spirits of their ancestors, and Sir Robert, perhaps because he was undoubtedly of Roman imperial blood, kept up the same custom. Frank used irreverently to call it "family prayers."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301515"><said direct="false">To know how the Granthams were connected with the Campbells, and the Vere de Veres, and the Stanleys, and the Montmorencies, and fifty other bluest strains, seemed to Sir Robert to be an essential part of a liberal education.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301516"><said direct="false">To try to be late for family prayers was hopeless. They were at no fixed hour, and were held as many times during the day as necessary. Sometimes they were cut down to a sentence or two; suggested by the mention of some ducal name; sometimes they involved a lengthy, pious orgie in front of the portraits. To-night Edith was distinctly to blame, for she deliberately asked the name of the artist who had painted the picture hanging over the door into the library.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301517"><said direct="false">Sir Robert, according to custom, seemed rather bored by the subject. "Let's see," he said; "I've got no head for names. I think that's the one, of my great-grandfather, isn't it? A tall, handsome man in peer's robes?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301518"><said direct="true">"Now he's off."</said><said direct="false"> This sotto voce from Frank, who was reading Badminton on Cover Shooting.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301519"><said direct="false">Sir Robert drew his hand over his beautiful moustache once or twice.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301520"><said direct="true">"Ah, yes, how stupid of me. That's the Reynolds, of course. Reynolds was quite unknown when he did that portrait. Lord Linton, that was my great-grand-father—he was made an earl after that portrait was taken—saw a drawing in a little shop in Piccadilly, which took his fancy, and he inquired the name of the artist. The shopman didn't know; but he said that the young man came very often with drawings to sell, and he gave him a trifle for them. Well, Lord Linton sent for him, and gave him a commission to do his portrait, had it exhibited, and young Reynolds came into notice. The portrait came into possession of my grandfather, who, as you know, was a younger son; don't know how, and there it is."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301521"><said direct="true">"It's a beautiful picture,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Edith.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301522"><said direct="true">"Ah, you like it? Lord Sandown, my first cousin, was here last week, and he said, 'Didn't know you'd been raised to the Peerage yet, Bob.' He thought it was a portrait of me. It is said to be very like. You'd noticed the resemblance, no doubt?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301523"><said direct="true">"A tall, handsome man,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Frank to the fireplace.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301524"><said direct="true">"I don't know as much as I ought about my ancestors,"</said><said direct="false"> continued Sir Robert, who was doing himself a gross injustice. "You ought to get Sandown on the subject. I found a curious old drawing the other day in a scrapbook belonging to my father. The name Grantham is printed in the centre of a large folio sheet, with a circle round it to imitate the sun, and from it go out rays in all directions, with the names of the different families with which we have intermarried."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301525"><said direct="true">"I haven't got any ancestors,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Edith. "My grandfather was a draper in Leeds, and made his fortune there. I should think ancestors were a great responsibility; you have to live up to them, or else they live down to you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301526"><said direct="true">"I'm always saying to Frank,"</said><said direct="false"> said Sir Robert, "that you have to judge a man by himself, and not by his family. If a man is a pleasant fellow it doesn't matter whether his family came over with the Conqueror or not. Our parson here, for instance, he's a decent sensible fellow, and I'm always delighted to give him a few days' shooting, or see him to dinner on Sunday after his services. His father was a tobacconist in the village, you know. There's the shop there now."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301527"><said direct="false">Edith rose to go.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301528"><said direct="false">Sir Robert lighted her candle for her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301529"><said direct="true">"I should like to show you the few portraits we've got,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "There are some interesting names amongst them; but, of course, most of our family things are at Langfort."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301530"><said direct="true">"My grandfather's yard measure is the only heirloom that we've got,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "I'll show it to Lady Grantham when she comes to stay with me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301531"><said direct="false">Frank had followed them into the hall.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301532"><said direct="true">"Family prayers over yet, father?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked. "I shall go and smoke. I hope you've been devout, Miss Staines."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301533"><said direct="false">Edith left the Granthams two days after this, "to buy legs of mutton," she explained, "and hire a charwoman. I don't suppose there's anyone at home. But I shall have things straight by the time you come."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301534"><said direct="false">Sir Robert was very gracious, and promised to send her a short memoir he was writing on the fortunes of the family. It was to be bound in white vellum, with their arms in gilt upon the outside.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301535"><said direct="false">Edith, found no one at home but a few servants on board wages, who did not seem at all pleased to see her. She devoted her evening to what she called tidying, which consisted in emptying the contents of a quantity of drawers on to the floor of her room, and sitting down beside them. She turned them over with much energy for about half an hour, and then decided that she could throw nothing away, and told her maid to put them back again, and played her piano till bed-time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301536"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham and Nora followed in a few days, and Dodo was to come the same evening. They were sitting put in the garden after dinner, when the sound of wheels was heard, and Edith went round to the front door to welcome her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301537"><said direct="false">Dodo had not dined, so she went and "made hay among the broken meats," as she expressed it. Travelling produced no kind of fatigue in her; and the noise, and shaking, and smuts, that prey on most of us in railway carriages always seemed to leave her untouched. Dodo was particularly glad to get to England. She had had rather a trying time of it towards the end, for Jack and the Prince got on extremely badly together, and, as they both wished to be with Dodo, collisions were frequent. She gave the story of her adventure to Edith with singular frankness as she ate her broken meats.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301538"><said direct="true">"You see, Jack got it into his head that the Prince is a cad and a brute,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I quite admit that he may be, only neither Jack nor I have the slightest opportunity for judging. Socially he is neither, and what he is morally doesn't concern me. How should it? It isn't my business to inquire into his moral character. I'm not his mother nor his mother confessor. He is good company. I particularly like his sister, whom you must come and see, Edith. She and the Prince are going to stay with us when we get back to Winston; and he knows how to behave. Jack has a vague sort of feeling that his morals ought to prevent him from tolerating the Prince, which made him try to find opportunities for disliking him. But Jack didn't interfere with me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301539"><said direct="true">"No,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith; "I really don't see why private individuals shouldn't associate with whom they like. One doesn't feel bound to be friends with people of high moral character, so I don't see why one should be bound to dislike people of low ditto."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301540"><said direct="true">"That's exactly my view,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "morals don't come into the question at all. I particularly dislike some of the cardinal virtues—and the only reason for associating with anybody is that one takes pleasure in their company. Of course one wouldn't go about with a murderer, however amusing, because his moral deficiencies-might produce unpleasant physical consequences to yourself. But my morals are able to look after themselves. I'm not afraid of moral cut-throats. Morals don't come into the social circle. You might as well dislike a man because he's got a sharp elbow-joint. He won't use it on your ribs, you know, in the drawing-room. To get under the influence of an immoral man would be different. We'll, I've finished. Where are the others? Give me a cigarette, Edith. I sha'n't shock your servants, shall I? I've given up shocking people."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301541"><said direct="false">Dodo and Edith strolled out, and Dodo was introduced to Lady Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301542"><said direct="true">"What an age you and Edith have been,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I have been dying to see you, Dodo."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301543"><said direct="true">"We were talking,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "and for once Edith agreed with me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301544"><said direct="true">"She never agrees with me,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Lady Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301545"><said direct="true">"I wonder if I should always agree with you then,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Do things that disagree with the same thing agree with one another?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301546"><said direct="true">"What did Edith agree with you about?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301547"><said direct="true">"I'm not sure that I did really agree with her,"</said><said direct="false"> interpolated Edith.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301548"><said direct="true">"Oh, about morals,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I said that a man's morals did not matter in ordinary social life. That they did not come into the question at all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301549"><said direct="true">"No, I don't think I do agree with you,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "All social life is a degree of intimacy, and you said yourself that you wouldn't get under the influence of an immoral man—in other words, you wouldn't be intimate with him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301550"><said direct="true">"Oh, being intimate hasn't anything to do with being under a man's influence,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I'm very intimate with lots of people. Jack, for instance, but I'm not under his influence."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301551"><said direct="true">"Then you think it doesn't matter whether society is composed of people without morals?"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301552"><said direct="true">"I think it's a bad thing that morals should deteriorate in any society,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "but I don't think that society should take cognisance of the moral code. Public opinion don't touch that. If a man is a brute, he won't be any better for knowing that other people disapprove of him. If he knows that, and is worth anything at all, it will simply have the opposite effect on him. He very likely will try to hide it; but that doesn't make it any better. A whited sepulchre is no better than a sepulchre unwhitened. You must act by your own lights. If an action doesn't seem to you wrong nothing in the world will prevent your doing it, if your desire is sufficiently strong. You cannot elevate tone by punishing offences. There are no fewer criminals since the tread-mill was invented and Botany Bay discovered."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301553"><said direct="true">"You mean that there would be no increase in crime if the law did not punish?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301554"><said direct="true">"I mean that punishment is not the best way of checking crime, though that is really altogether a different question. You won't check immorality by dealing with it as a social crime."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301555"><said direct="false">There was a short silence, broken only by the whispering of the wind in the fir trees. Then on the stillness came a light, rippling laugh. Dodo got out of her chair, and plucked a couple of roses from a bush near her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301556"><said direct="true">"I can't be serious any longer,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "not a single moment longer. I'm so dreadfully glad to be in England again. Really, there is no place like it. I hate the insolent extravagant beauty of Switzerland —it is like chromo lithographs. Look at that long, flat, grey distance over there. There is nothing so beautiful as that abroad."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301557"><said direct="false">Dodo fastened the roses in the front of her dress, and laughed again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301558"><said direct="true">"I laugh for pure happiness,"</said><said direct="false"> she continued. "I laughed when I saw the cliff of Dover to-day, not because I was sea-sick—I never am sea-sick—but simply because I was coming home again. Jack parted from me at Dover. I am very happy about Jack. I believe in him thoroughly."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301559"><said direct="false">Dodo was getting serious again in spite of herself. Lady Grantham was watching her curiously, and without any feeling of disappointment. She did not wear spectacles, she was, at least, as tall as herself, and she dressed, if anything, rather better. She was still wearing half-mourning, but half-mourning suited Dodo very well.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301560"><said direct="true">"Decidedly it's a pity to analyse one's feelings,"</said><said direct="false"> Dodo went on, "they do resolve themselves into such very small factors. I am well, I am in England, where you can eat your dinner without suspicion of frogs, or caterpillars in your cauliflower. I had two caterpillars in my cauliflower at Zermatt one night. I shall sleep in a clean white bed, and I shall not have to use Keating. I can talk as ridiculously as I like, without thinking of the French for anything. Oh, I'm entirely happy."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301561"><said direct="false">Dodo was aware of more reasons for happiness than she mentioned. She was particularly conscious of the relief she felt in getting away from the Prince. For some days past she had been unpleasantly aware of his presence. She could not manage to think of him quite as lightly as she thought of anyone else. It was a continual effort to her to appear quite herself in his presence, and she was constantly rushing into extremes in order to seem at her ease. He was stronger, she felt, than she was, and she did not like it. The immense relief which his absence brought more than compensated for the slight blankness that his absence left. In a way she felt dependent on him, which chafed and irritated her, for she had never come under such a yoke before. She had had several moments of sudden anger against herself on her way home. She found herself always thinking about him when she was not thinking about anything else; and though she was quite capable of sending her thoughts off to other subjects, when they had done their work they always fluttered back again to the same resting-place, and Dodo was conscious of an effort, slight indeed, but still an effort, in frightening them off. Her curious insistence on her own happiness had struck Edith. She felt it unnatural that Dodo should mention it, and she drew one of two conclusions from it; either that Dodo had had a rather trying time, for some reason or other, or that she wished to convince herself, by constant repetition, of something that she was not quite sure about; and both of these conclusions were in a measure correct.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301562"><said direct="true">"Who was out at Zermatt when you were there?"</said><said direct="false"> inquired Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301563"><said direct="true">"Oh, there was mother there, and Maud and her husband, and a Russian princess, Waldenech's sister, and Jack, of course,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301564"><said direct="true">"Wasn't Prince Waldenech there himself?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301565"><said direct="true">"The Prince? Oh yes, he was there; didn't I say so?"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301566"><said direct="true">"He's rather amusing, isn't he?"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I don't know him at all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301567"><said direct="true">"Oh, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "a little ponderous, you know, but very presentable, and good company."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301568"><said direct="false">Edith looked up suddenly at Dodo. There was an elaborate carelessness, she thought, in her voice. It was just a little overdone. The night was descending fast, and she could only just see the lines of her face above the misty folds of her grey dress. But even in that half light she thought that her careless voice did not quite seem a true interpretation of her expression. It might have been only the dimness of the shadow, but she thought she looked anxious and rather depressed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301569"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham drew her shawl more closely round her shoulders, and remarked that it was getting cold. Edith got up and prepared to go in, and Miss Grantham nestled in her chair. Only Dodo stood quite motionless, and Edith noticed that her hands were tearing one of the roses to pieces, and scattering the petals on the grass.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301570"><said direct="true">"Are you going in, Dodo?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked; "or would you rather stop out a little longer?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301571"><said direct="true">"I think I won't come in just yet,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "it's so delightful to have a breath of cool air, after being in a stuffy carriage all day. But don't any of you stop out if you'd rather go in. I shall just smoke one more cigarette."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301572"><said direct="true">"I'll stop with you, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I don't want to go in at all. Edith, if you're going in, throw the windows in the drawing-room open, and play to us."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301573"><said direct="false">Lady Grantham and Edith went towards the house.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301574"><said direct="true">"I didn't expect her to be a bit like that,"</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Grantham. "I always heard she was so lively, and talked more nonsense in half an hour than we can get through in a year. She's very beautiful."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301575"><said direct="true">"I think Dodo must be tired or something,"</said><said direct="false"> said Edith. "I never saw her like that before. She was horribly serious. I hope nothing has happened."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301576"><said direct="false">The piano in the drawing-room was close to a large French window opening on to the lawn. Edith threw it open, and stood for a moment looking out into the darkness. She could just see Dodo and Nora sitting where they had left them, though they were no more than two pale spots against the dark background. She was conscious of a strange feeling that there was an undercurrent at work in Dodo, which showed itself by a few chance bubbles and little sudden eddies on the surface, which she thought required explanation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301577"><said direct="false">Dodo certainly was not quite like herself. There was no edge to her vivacity: her attempts not to be serious had been distinctly forced, and she was unable to keep it up. Edith felt a vague sense of coming disaster; slight but certain. However, she drew her chair to the piano and began to play.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301578"><said direct="false">Miss Grantham was conscious of the same sort of feeling. Since the others had gone in, Dodo had sat quite silent, and she had not taken her cigarette.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301579"><said direct="true">"You had a nice time then, abroad?"</said><said direct="false"> she remarked at length.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301580"><said direct="true">"Oh, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, rousing herself. "I enjoyed it a good deal. The hotel was full of the hotel class, you know. A little trying at times, but not to matter. We had a charming party there. Algernon is getting quite worldly. However, he is ridiculously fond of Maud, and she'll keep him straight. Do you know the Prince?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301581"><said direct="true">"Hardly at all,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301582"><said direct="true">"What do you think of him, as far as you've seen?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301583"><said direct="true">"I think he is rather impressive,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I felt I should do as he told me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301584"><said direct="true">"Ah, you think that, do you?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo, with the most careful carelessness. "He struck me that way, too, a little."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301585"><said direct="true">"I should think he was an instance of what Edith meant when she said that to be intimate with anyone was to be under their influence."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301586"><said direct="true">"Edith's awfully wrong, I think, about the whole idea,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, hastily. "I should hate to be under anyone's influence; yet, I think, the only pleasure of knowing people is to be intimate. I would sooner have one real friend than fifty acquaintances."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301587"><said direct="true">"Did you see much of him?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301588"><said direct="true">"Yes, a good deal,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "a great deal, in fact. I think Edith's right about intimacy as regards him, though he's an exception. In general, I think, she's wrong. What's that she's playing?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301589"><said direct="true">"Anyhow, it's Wagner,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301590"><said direct="true">"I know it,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "It's the 'Tannhauser' overture. Listen, there's the Venus motif crossing the Pilgrim's march. Ah, that's simply wicked. The worst of it is, the Venus part is so much more attractive than the other. It's horrible."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301591"><said direct="true">"You're dreadfully serious to-night, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301592"><said direct="true">"I'm a little tired, I think,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I was travelling all last night, you know. Come, let's go in."</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301593"><said direct="false">Dodo went to bed soon afterwards. She said she was tired, and a little overdone. Edith looked at her rather closely as she said good-night.</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301594"><said direct="true">"You're sure it's nothing more?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked. "There's nothing wrong with you, is there?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG189301595"><said direct="true">"I shall be all right in the morning,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, rather wearily. "Don't let them call me till nine."</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG18930392"><said direct="true">"I don't think you need forgiveness much,"</said><said direct="false"> said</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930393"><said direct="false">Dodo softly. "If you only knew——" She stopped and finished her sentence by a smile.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930394"><said direct="true">"Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said again, "I've often wanted to suggest something to you, but I didn't quite like to. Why don't we have family prayers here? I might build a little chapel."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930395"><said direct="false">Dodo felt a sudden inclination to laugh. Her æsthetic pleasure in the chapter of Revelation was gone. She felt annoyed and amused at this simple-minded man, who thought her so perfect, and ascribed such fatiguingly high interpretations to all her actions. He really was a little stupid and tiresome. He had broken up all her little pleasant thoughts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930396"><said direct="true">"Oh, family prayers always strike me as rather ridiculous,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, with a half yawn. "A row of gaping servants is not conducive to the emotions."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930397"><said direct="false">She got up and joined the other groups, and then suddenly became aware that, for the first time, she had failed in her part. Jack was watching her, and saw what had happened. Chesterford had remained, seated at the window, pulling his long, brown moustache, with a very perceptible shade of annoyance on his face. Dodo felt a sudden impulse of anger with herself at her stupidity. She went back to Chesterford.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930398"><said direct="true">"Dear old boy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "I don't know why I said that. I was thinking of something else. I don't know that I like family prayers very much. We used to have them at home, when my father was with us, and it really was a trial to hear him read the Litany. I suppose it is that which has made me rather tired of them. Come and talk to the Professor."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930399"><said direct="false">Then she went across to Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930400"><said direct="true">"Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, in a low voice, "don't look as if you thought you were right."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930401"><said direct="false">The same afternoon Chesterford took Mrs. Vivian off to see "almshouses and drunkards," as Dodo expressed it to Jack. She also told him that Edith and her Herr were playing a sort of chopsticks together in the drawing-room. Maud had, as usual, effaced herself, and Bertie was consuming an alarming number of cigarettes in the smoking-room, and pretending to write letters.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930402"><said direct="false">It was natural, therefore, that when Jack strolled into the hall, to see what was going on, he should find Dodo there with her toes on the fender of the great fireplace, having banished the collie to find other quarters for himself. Dodo was making an effort to read, but she was not being very successful, and hailed Jack's entrance with evident pleasure.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930403"><said direct="true">"Come along,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "I sent the dog off, but I can find room for you. Sit here, Jack."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930404"><said direct="false">She moved her chair a little aside, and let him pass.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930405"><said direct="true">"I can't think why a merciful providence sends us a day like this,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I want to know whom it benefits to have a thick snowfall. Listen at that, too," she added, as a great gust of wind swept round the corner of the house, and made a deep, roaring sound up in the heart of the chimney.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930406"><said direct="true">"It makes it all the more creditable in Chesterford and Mrs. Vivian to go to see the drunkards,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930407"><said direct="true">"Oh, but that's no credit,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "They like doing it, it gives them real pleasure. I don't see why that should be any better, morally speaking, than sitting here and talking. They are made that way, you and I are made this. We weren't consulted, and we both follow our inclinations. Besides, they will have their reward, for they will have immense appetites at tea."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930408"><said direct="true">"And will give us something to talk about now,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Jack lazily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930409"><said direct="true">"Don't you like Grantie, Jack?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo presently. "She and Ledgers are talking about life and being in my room. I went to get a book from here, and the fire was so nice that I stopped."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930410"><said direct="true">"I wish Ledgers wouldn't treat her like a menagerie, and put her through her tricks,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack. "I think she is very attractive, but she belongs too much to a class."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930411"><said direct="true">"What class?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930412"><said direct="true">"Oh, the class that prides itself on not being of any class—the all things to all men class."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930413"><said direct="true">"Oh, I belong to that,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930414"><said direct="true">"No, you don't,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "You are all things to some men, I grant, but not to all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930415"><said direct="true">"Oh, Jack, that's a bad joke,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, reprovingly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930416"><said direct="true">"It's quite serious all the same,"</said><said direct="false"> said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930417"><said direct="true">"I'm all things to the only man to whom it matters that I should be,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo complacently.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930418"><said direct="false">Jack felt rather disgusted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930419"><said direct="true">"I wish you would not state things in that cold-blooded way,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Your very frankness to me about it shows you know that it is an effort."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930420"><said direct="true">"Yes,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "it is an effort sometimes, but I don't think I want to talk about it. You take things too ponderously. Don't be ponderous; it doesn't suit you in the least. Besides, there is nothing to be ponderous about."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930421"><said direct="false">Dodo turned in her chair and looked Jack full in the face. Her face had a kind of triumph about it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930422"><said direct="true">"I want to say something more,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930423"><said direct="true">"Well, I'm magnanimous to-day,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Go on."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930424"><said direct="true">"All you are doing,"</said><said direct="false"> said he gravely, "is to keep up the original illusion he had about you. It is not any good keeping up an illusion, and thinking you're doing your whole duty."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930425"><said direct="true">"Jack, that's enough,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, with a certain finality in her tone. "If you go on, you may make me distrust myself. I do not mean that as a compliment to your powers, but as a confession to a stupid superstitious weakness in myself. I am afraid of omens."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930426"><said direct="false">They sat silent a minute or two, until a door at the far end of the hall opened and Miss Grantham came through, with her showman in tow.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930427"><said direct="true">"Lord Ledgers and I were boring each other so,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham, "that we came to bore someone else. When you are boring people you may as well do it wholesale. What a pity it is that one hasn't got a tail like a dog, that cannot help wagging if the owner is pleased, and which stops wagging when he isn't."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930428"><said direct="true">"I shall certainly buy a tail,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, with grave consideration. "One or two, in case the first gets out of order. Must you wag it whenever you are pleased, Grantie? Is it to be an honest tail? Suppose you only think you are pleased, when you are not really, what does the tail do then? Oh, it's very complicated."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930429"><said direct="true">"The tail shares the same illusions as the dog,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930430"><said direct="true">"Jack and I were talking about illusions,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930431"><said direct="true">"I'm going to get a quantity of illusions,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "In any case, what did you find to say about them?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930432"><said direct="true">"Jack said it was a bad thing to keep an illusion up,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, broadly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930433"><said direct="false">Miss Grantham was staring pensively at the fire.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930434"><said direct="true">"I saw two boys sitting on a gate yesterday,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "and they pushed each other off, and each time they both roared with laughter. I'm sure it was an illusion that they were amused. I would go and sit on a gate with pleasure and get my maid to push me off, if I thought it would amuse either of us. Mr. Broxton, would you like me to push you off a gate?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930435"><said direct="true">"Oh, I'm certain that the people with many illusions are the happiest,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Consequently, I wouldn't willingly destroy any illusion anyone held about anything."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930436"><said direct="true">"What a lot of anys,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930437"><said direct="false">Lord Ledgers was leaning back in his chair with a sense of pleased proprietorship. It really was a very intelligent animal. Jack almost expected him to take a small whip from his pocket and crack it at her. But his next remark, Jack felt, was a good substitute; at any rate, he demanded another performance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930438"><said direct="true">"What about delusions, Miss Grantham?"</said><said direct="false"> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930439"><said direct="true">"Oh, delusions are chiefly unpleasant illusions,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Madmen have delusions that somebody wants to kill them, or they want to kill somebody, or that King Charles's head isn't really cut off, which would be very unsettling now."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930440"><said direct="true">"Grantie, I believe you're talking sheer, arrant nonsense,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "It's all your fault, Tommy. When one is asked a question, one has to answer it somehow or other in self-defence. If you asked me about the habits of giraffes I should say something. Edith is the only really honest person I know. She would tell you she hadn't any idea what a giraffe was, so would Chesterford, and you would find him looking up giraffes in the Encyclopædia afterwards."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930441"><said direct="false">Lord Ledgers laughed a low, unpleasant laugh.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930442"><said direct="true">"A very palpable hit,"</said><said direct="false"> he murmured.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930443"><said direct="false">The remark was inaudible to all but Jack. He felt quite unreasonably angry with him, and got up from his chair.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930444"><said direct="false">Dodo saw something had happened, and looked at him inquiringly. Jack did not meet her eye, but whistled to the collie, who flopped down at his feet.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930445"><said direct="true">"I really don't know where I should begin if I was going to turn honest,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham. "I don't think I like honest people. They are like little cottages, which children draw, with a door in the middle, and a window at each side, and a chimney in the roof with smoke coming out. Long before you know them well, you are perfectly certain of all that you will find inside them. They haven't got any little surprises, or dark passages, or queer little cupboards under the stairs."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930446"><said direct="true">"Do you know the plant called honesty, Grantie?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo. "It's a very bright purple, and you can see it a long way off, and it isn't at all nicer when you get close than it looks from a distance."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930447"><said direct="true">"Oh, if you speak of someone as an honest man,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham, "it implies that he's nothing particular besides. I don't mind a little mild honesty, but it should be kept in the background."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930448"><said direct="true">"I've got a large piece of honesty somewhere about me,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack. "I can't always lay my hand on it, but every now and then I feel it like a great lump inside me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930449"><said direct="true">"Yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "I believe you are fundamentally honest, Jack. I've always thought that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930450"><said direct="true">"Does that mean that he is not honest in ordinary matters?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Miss Grantham. "I've noticed that people who are fundamentally truthful, seldom tell the truth."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930451"><said direct="true">"In a way it does,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "But I'm sure Jack would be honest in any case where it really mattered."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930452"><said direct="true">"Oh, I sha'n't steal your spoons, you know,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930453"><said direct="true">"That's only because you don't really want them,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Dodo. "I can conceive you stealing anything you wanted."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930454"><said direct="true">"Trample on me,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham serenely. "Tell us what I should steal."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930455"><said direct="true">"Oh, you'd steal lots of things,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You'd steal anyone's self-respect if you could manage to, and you couldn't get what you wanted any other way. Oh, yes, you'd steal anything important. Jack wouldn't. He'd stop just short of that; he would never be really disloyal. He'd finger things to any extent, but I am pretty sure that he would drop them at the last minute."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930456"><said direct="true">"How dreadfully unpleasant I am really,"</said><said direct="false"> said Miss Grantham meditatively. "A kind of Eugene Aram."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930457"><said direct="false">Jack was acutely uncomfortable, but he had the satisfaction of believing that what Dodo said about him was true. He had come to the same conclusion himself two nights ago. He believed that he would stop short of any act of disloyalty, but he did not care about hearing Dodo give him so gratuitous a testimonial before Miss Grantham and the gentleman whom he mentally referred to as "that ass of a showman."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930458"><said direct="false">The front door opened, and a blast of cold wind came blustering round into the inner hall where they were sitting, making the thick tapestry portière belly and fill like a ship's sail, when the wind first catches it. The collie pricked his ears, and thumped his tail on the floor with vague welcome.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930459"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian entered, followed by Lord Chesterford. He looked absurdly healthy and happy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930460"><said direct="true">"It's a perfectly beastly day,"</said><said direct="false"> he said cheerfully, advancing to the fireplace. "Mrs. Vivian, let Dodo send you some tea up to your room. You must be wet through. Surely it is tea-time, Dodo."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930461"><said direct="true">"I told you so,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo to Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930462"><said direct="true">"Has Jack been saying it isn't tea-time?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Chesterford.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930463"><said direct="true">"No,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I only said that your virtue in going to see almshouses would find its immediate reward in an appetite for tea."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930464"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930465"><said direct="true">"You mustn't reduce our virtues to the lowest terms, as if we were two vulgar fractions."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930466"><said direct="true">"Do you suppose a vulgar fraction knows how vulgar it is?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930467"><said direct="true">"Vulgar without being funny,"</said><said direct="false"> said. Jack, with the air of helping her out of a difficulty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930468"><said direct="true">"I never saw anything funny in vulgar fractions,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Lord Ledgers. "Chesterford and I used to look up the answers at the end of the book, and try to make them correspond with the questions."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930469"><said direct="false">Dodo groaned.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930470"><said direct="true">"Oh, Chesterford, don't tell me you're not honest either."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930471"><said direct="true">"What do you think about honesty, Mrs. Vivian?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Miss Grantham.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930472"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian considered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930473"><said direct="true">"Honesty is much maligned by being called the best policy,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "it' isn't purely commercial. Honesty is rather fine sometimes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930474"><said direct="true">"Oh, I'm sure Mrs. Vivian's honest,"</said><said direct="false"> murmured Miss Grantham. "She thinks before, she tells you her opinion. I always give my opinion first, and think about it afterwards."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930475"><said direct="true">"I've been wanting to stick up for honesty all the afternoon,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo to Mrs. Vivian, "only I haven't dared. Everyone has been saying that it is dull and obtrusive, and like labourers' cottages. I believe we are all a little honest, really. No one has got any right to call it the best policy. It makes you feel as if you were either a kind of life assurance, or else a thief."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930476"><said direct="false">Chesterford looked a trifle puzzled.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930477"><said direct="false">Dodo turned to him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930478"><said direct="true">"Poor old man,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "did they call him names? Never mind. We'll go and be labelled 'Best policy. No others need apply.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930479"><said direct="false">She got up from her chair, and pulled Chesterford's moustache.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930480"><said direct="true">"You look so abominably healthy, Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "How's Charlie getting on? Tell him if he beats his wife anymore, I shall; beat you. You wouldn't like that, you know. Will you ring for tea, dear? Mrs. Vivian, I command you to go to your room. I had your fire lit, and I'll send tea up. You're a dripping sop."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930481"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian pleaded guilty, and vanished. Sounds of music still came from the drawing-room. "It's no use telling Edith to come to tea," remarked Dodo. "She said the other day that if anyone ever proposed to her, whom she cared to marry, she will feel it only fair to tell him that the utmost she can offer him, is to play second fiddle to her music."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930482"><said direct="false">Edith's music was strongly exciting, and in the pause that followed, Dodo went to the door and opened it softly, and a great tangle of melody poured out and filled the hall. She was playing the last few pages of the overture to an opera that she had nearly completed. The music was gathering itself up for the finale. Note after note was caught up, as it were, to join an army of triumphant melody overhead, which grew fuller and more complete every moment, and seemed to hover, waiting for some fulfilment. Ah, that was it. Suddenly from below crashed out a great kingly motif, strong with the strength of a man who is pure and true, rising higher and higher, till it joined the triumph overhead, and moved away, strong to the end.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930483"><said direct="false">There was a dead silence; Dodo was standing by the door, with her lips slightly parted, feeling that there was something in this world better and bigger, perhaps, than her own little hair-splittings and small emotions. With this in her mind, she looked across to where Chesterford was standing. The movement was purely instinctive, and she could neither have accounted for it, nor was she conscious of it, but in her eyes there was the suggestion of unshed tears, and a look of questioning shame. Though a few bars of music cannot change the nature of the weakest of us, and Dodo was far from weak, she was intensely impressionable, and that moment had for her the germ of a possibility which might—who could say it could not?—have taken root in her and borne fruit. The parable of the mustard seed is as-old and as true as time. But Chesterford was not musical; he had taken a magazine from the table, and was reading about grouse disease.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930484"><said direct="false">Dodo was sitting in a remarkably easy-chair in her own particular room at the house in Eaton Square. As might have been expected, her room was somewhat unlike other rooms. It had a pale orange-coloured paper, with a dado of rather more intense shade of the same colour, an orange-coloured carpet and orange-coloured curtains. Dodo had no reason to be afraid of orange colour just yet. It was a room well calculated to make complete idleness most easy. The tables were covered with a mass of albums, vases of flowers, and a quantity of entirely useless knick-knacks. The walls were hung with several rather clever sketches, French prints and caricatures of Dodo's friends. A small bookcase displayed a quantity of flaring novels and a large tune hymn-book, and in a conspicuous corner was Dodo's praying-table, on which the skull regarded its surroundings with a mirthless and possibly contemptuous grin. The mantelpiece was entirely covered with photographs, all signed by their prototypes. These had found their quarters gradually becoming too small for them, and had climbed half way up the two-sides of a Louis Quinze mirror, that formed a sort of overmantel. The photographs were an interesting study, and included representatives from a very wide range of classes. No one ever accused Dodo of being exclusive. In the corner of the room were a heap of old cotillion toys, several hunting-whips, and a small black image of the Virgin, which Dodo had picked up abroad. Above her head a fox's mask grinned defiantly at another fox's brush opposite. On the writing table there was an inkstand made of the hoof of Dodo's favourite hunter, which had joined the majority shortly after Christmas, and the "Dodo" symphony, which had just come out with great éclat at the Albert Hall, leant against the wall. A banjo case and a pair of castanets, with a dainty silver monogram on them, perhaps inspired Dodo when she sat down to her writing-table.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930485"><said direct="false">Dodo's hands were folded on her lap, and she was lazily regarding a photograph of herself which stood oh the mantelpiece. Though the afternoon was of a warm day in the end of May, there was a small fire on the hearth which crackled pleasantly. Dodo got up and looked at the photograph more closely. "I certainly look older," she thought to herself, "and yet that was only taken a year ago. I don't feel a bit older, at least I sha'n't when I get quite strong again. I wish Jack could have been able to come this afternoon. I am rather tired of seeing nobody except Chesterford and the baby. However, Mrs. Vivian will be here soon."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930486"><said direct="false">Dodo had made great friends with Mrs. Vivian during the last months. Her sister and brother-in-law had been obliged to leave England for a month at Easter, and Dodo had insisted that Mrs. Vivian should spend it with them, and to-day was the first day that the doctor had let her come down, and she had written to Jack and Mrs. Vivian to come and have tea with her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930487"><said direct="false">A tap was heard at the door, and the nurse entered, bearing the three weeks' old baby. Dodo was a little disappointed; she had seen a good deal of the baby, and she particularly wanted Mrs. Vivian. She stood with her hands behind her back, without offering to take it. The baby regarded her with large wide eyes, and crowed at the sight of the fire. Really it was rather attractive, after all.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930488"><said direct="true">"Well, Lord Harchester,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Dodo, "how is your lordship to-day? Did it ever enter your very pink head that you were a most important personage? Really you have very little sense of your dignity. Oh, you are rather, nice. Come here, baby."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930489"><said direct="false">She held out her arms to take it, but his lordship apparently did not approve of this change. He opened his mouth in preparation for a decent protest.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930490"><said direct="true">"Ah, do you know, I don't like you when you howl,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "you might be an Irish member instead of a piece of landed interest. Oh, do stop. Take him please, nurse; I've got a headache, and I don't like that noise. There, you unfilial scoundrel, you're quiet enough now."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930491"><said direct="false">Dodo nodded at the baby with the air of a slight acquaintance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930492"><said direct="true">"I wonder if you'll be like your father,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "you've got his big blue eyes. I rather wish your eyes were dark. Do a baby's eyes change when he gets older? Ah, here's your godmother. I am so glad to see you," she went on to Mrs. Vivian. "You see his lordship has come down to say how do you do."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930493"><said direct="true">"Dear Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vivian, "you are looking wonderfully better. Why don't they let you go out this lovely day?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930494"><said direct="true">"Oh, I've got a cold,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "at least I'm told so. There—good-bye, my lord. You'd better take him upstairs again, nurse. I am so delighted to see you," she continued; pouring out tea. "I've been rather dull all day. Don't you know how, when you particularly want to see people; they never come. Edith looked in this morning, but she did nothing but whistle and drop things. I asked Jack to come, but he couldn't."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930495"><said direct="true">"Ah,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vivian softly, "he has come back, has he?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930496"><said direct="true">"Yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "and I wanted to see him. Did you ever hear of anything so ridiculous as his going off in that way. You know he left England directly after his visit to us in January, and he's only just back. It's too absurd for Jack to pretend he was ill. He swore his doctor had told him to leave England for three months. Of course that's nonsense. It was very stupid of him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930497"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian sipped her tea reflectively without answering.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930498"><said direct="true">"Chesterford is perfectly silly about the baby,"</said><said direct="false"> Dodo went on. "He's always afraid it's going to be ill, and he goes up on tiptoe to the nursery, to see if it's all right. Last night he woke me up about half-past ten, to say that he heard it cough several times, and did I think it was the whooping cough."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930499"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian did not seem to be listening.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930500"><said direct="true">"I heard from Mr. Broxton once,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "he wrote from Moscow, and asked how you were, and three weeks ago he telegraphed, when he heard of the birth of the baby."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930501"><said direct="true">"I don't know what's the matter with Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, rather petulantly. "He wrote to me once, the silliest letter you ever saw, describing the Kremlin, and Trèves Cathedral, and the falls of the Rhine. The sort of letter one writes to one's great-aunt. Now I'm not Jack's great-aunt at all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930502"><said direct="false">There was another tap at the door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930503"><said direct="true">"That's Chesterford,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Dodo, "he always raps now, and if I don't answer he thinks I'm asleep, and then he goes away. You just see."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930504"><said direct="false">The tap came again, and after a moment's interval the door opened.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930505"><said direct="true">"Jack!"</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930506"><said direct="false">She got up from her chair and went quickly towards him. Jack was pale, and his breath came rather short, as if he had been running.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930507"><said direct="true">"Why, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he cried, "I thought I couldn't come, and then I thought I could, so I did."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930508"><said direct="false">He broke off rather lamely, and greeted Mrs. Vivian.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930509"><said direct="true">"Dear old Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "it does me good to see you. Your face is so nice and familiar, and I've wanted you awfully. Jack, what do you mean by writing me such a stupid letter? especially when I'd written to you so nicely. Really, I'm not your grand-mother yet, though I am a mother. Have you seen the baby? It isn't particularly interesting at present, though of course it's rather nice to think that that wretched little morsel of flesh and bones is going to be one of our landed proprietors. He'll be much more important than you will ever be, Jack. Aren't you jealous?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930510"><said direct="false">Dodo was conscious of quite a fresh tide of interest in her life. Her intellectual faculties, she felt, had been neglected. She could not conceive why, because she had a husband and baby, she should be supposed not to care for other interests as well. Chesterford was an excellent husband, with a magnificent heart; but Dodo had told herself so often that he was not very clever, that she had ceased trying to take an intellectual pleasure in his society, and the baby could not be called intellectual by the fondest parent at present. There were a quantity of women who were content to pore on their baby's face for hour after hour, with no further occupation than saying "Didums" occasionally. Dodo had given what she considered a fair trial to this treatment, and she found it bored her to say "Didums" for an indefinite period, and she did not believe it amused the baby. She had a certain pride in having given birth to the son and heir of one of the largest English properties, and she was extremely glad to have done so, and felt a certain pleased sort of proprietorship in the little pink morsel, but she certainly had experienced none of the absorbing pleasures of maternity. She had got used to not being in love with her husband, and she accepted as part of this same deficiency the absence of absorbing pleasure in the baby. Not that she considered it a deficiency, it was merely another type turned out of Nature's workshop. Dodo laid all the blame on Nature. She shrugged her shoulders and said: "You made me so without consulting me. It isn't my fault!" But Dodo was aware that Nature had given her a brain, and she found a very decided pleasure in the company of clever people. Perhaps it was the greatest pleasure of her life to be admired and amused by clever people. Of course Chesterford always admired her, but he was in love with her, and he was not clever. Dodo had felt some difficulty before her marriage in dealing with this perplexing unknown quantity, and she had to confess it puzzled her still. The result was, that when it occurred, she had to admit her inability to tackle it, and as soon as possible to turn to another page in this algebra of life.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930511"><said direct="false">But she still felt that her marriage had been a great success. Chesterford had entirely fulfilled what she expected of him: he was immensely rich, he let her do as she liked, he adored her. Dodo quite felt that it was better that he should adore her. As long as that lasted, he would be blind to any fault of hers, and she acknowledged that, to a man of Chesterford's character, she must seem far from faultless, if he contemplated her calmly. But he was quite unable to contemplate her calmly. For him she walked in a golden cloud that dazzled and entranced him. Dodo was duly grateful to the golden cloud.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930512"><said direct="false">But she felt that the element which Jack, and Mrs. Vivian, and other friends of hers brought, had been conspicuously absent, and she welcomed its return with eagerness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930513"><said direct="true">"You know we haven't been leading a very intellectual life lately,"</said><said direct="false"> Dodo continued. "Chesterford is divinely kind to me, but he is careful not to excite me. So he talks chiefly about the baby, and how he lost his umbrella at the club; it is very soothing, but I have got past that now. I want stimulating. Sometimes I go to sleep, and then he sits as still as a mouse till I wake again. Pity me, Jack, I have had a dull fortnight; and that is worse than anything else. I really never remember being bored before!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930514"><said direct="false">Dodo let her arms drop beside her with a little hopeless gesture.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930515"><said direct="true">"I know one's got no business to be bored, and it's one's own fault as a rule if one is,"</said><said direct="false"> she went on. "For instance, that woman in the moated Grange ought to have swept away the blue fly that buzzed in the pane, and set a mouse-trap for the mouse that shrieked, and got the carpenter to repair the mouldering wainscot, and written to the Psychical Research, how she had heard her own sad name in corners cried, and it couldn't have been the cat, or she would have caught the shrieking mouse. Oh, there were a hundred things she might have done, before she sat down and said, 'He cometh not,' But I have had a period of enforced idleness. If I had set a trap for the mouse, the doctor would have told me not to exert myself so much.' I used to play Halma with Chesterford, only I always beat him; and then nobody ever cried my name in sad corners, that I remember; it would have been quite interesting."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930516"><said direct="false">Jack laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930517"><said direct="true">"What a miserable story, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "I always said—you had none of the domestic virtues, and I am right, it seems."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930518"><said direct="true">"Oh, it isn't that,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "but I happen to have a brain as well, and if I don't use it, it decays, and when it decays, it breeds maggots. I've got a big maggot in my head now, and that is, that the ineffable joys of maternity are much exaggerated. Don't look shocked, Geraldine. I know it's a maggot, and simply means that I haven't personally experienced them, but the maggot says, 'You are a woman, and if you don't experience them, either they don't exist, or you are abnormal.' Well, the maggot lies, I know it, I believe they do exist, and I am sure I am not abnormal. Ah, this is unprofitable, isn't it. You two have come to drive the maggot out."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930519"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian felt a sudden impulse of anger, which melted into pity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930520"><said direct="true">"Poor Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "leave the maggot alone, and he will die of inanition. At present give me some more tea. This really is very good tea, and you drink it the proper way, without milk or sugar, and with a little slice of lemon."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930521"><said direct="true">"Tea is such a middle-aged thing any other way,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, pouring out another cup. "I feel like an old woman in a workhouse if I put milk and sugar in it. Besides, you should only drink tea at tea. It produces the same effect as tobacco, a slight soothing of the nerves. One doesn't want to be soothed at breakfast, otherwise the tedious things we all have to do in the morning are impossible. Chesterford has a passion for the morning. He quoted something the other day about the divine morning. It isn't divine, it is necessary; at least you can't get to the evening without a morning, in this imperfect world. Now if it had only been 'the evening and the evening were the first day,' what a difference it would have made."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930522"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930523"><said direct="true">"You always bring up the heavy artillery to defend a small position, Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Keep your great guns for great occasions."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930524"><said direct="true">"Oh, I always use big guns,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack. "They do the work quicker. Besides, you never can tell that the small position is not the key to the large. The baby, for instance, that Dodo thinks very extremely insignificant now, may be horribly important in twenty years."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930525"><said direct="true">"Yes, I daresay Chesterford and I will quarrel about him,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "Supposing he falls in love with a curate's daughter, Chesterford will say something about love in a cottage, and I shall want him to marry a duke's daughter, and I shall get my way, and everybody concerned will be extremely glad afterwards."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930526"><said direct="true">"Poor baby,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vivian, "you little think what a worldly mother you have."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930527"><said direct="true">"Oh, I know I am worldly,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I don't deny it for a moment. Jack and I had it out before my marriage. But I believe I am capable of an unworldly action now and then. Why, I should wish Maud to marry a curate very much. She would do her part admirably, and no one could say it was a worldly fate. But I like giving everybody their chance. That is why I have Maud to stay with me, and let her get a good look at idle worldly people like Jack. After a girl has seen every sort, I wish her to choose, and I am unworldly enough to applaud her choice, if it is unworldly; only I shouldn't do it myself. I have no ideal; it was left out."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930528"><said direct="false">Jack was conscious of a keen resentment at Dodo's words. He had accepted her decision, but he didn't like to have it flaunted before him in Dodo's light voice and careless words. He made an uneasy movement in his chair. Dodo saw it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930529"><said direct="true">"Ah, Jack, I have offended you,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "it was stupid of me. But I have been so silent and lonely all these days, that it is such a relief to let my tongue wag at all, whatever it says. Ah, here's Chesterford. What an age you have been! Here am I consoling myself as best I can. Isn't it nice to have Jack again?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930530"><said direct="false">Chesterford saw the fresh light in her eyes, and the fresh vivaciousness in her speech, and he was so unfeignedly glad to see her more herself again, that no thought of jealousy entered his heart. He thought without bitterness, "How glad she must be to have her friends about her again! She looks better already. Decidedly I am a stupid old fellow, but I think Dodo loves me a little."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930531"><said direct="false">He shook hands with Jack, and beamed delightedly on Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930532"><said direct="true">"Jack, it is good of you to come so soon,"</said><said direct="false"> he said; "Dodo has missed you dreadfully. Have you seen the boy? Dodo, may I have him down?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930533"><said direct="true">"Oh, he's been down,"</said><said direct="false"> said she, "and has only just gone up again. He's rather fractious to-day. I daresay it's teeth. It's nothing to bother about; he's as well as possible."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930534"><said direct="false">Lord Chesterford looked disappointed, but ac-quiesced.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930535"><said direct="true">"I should like Jack to see him all the same,"</said><said direct="false"> he remarked. "May he come up to the nursery?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930536"><said direct="true">"Oh, Jack doesn't care about babies,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "even when they belong to you and me. Do you, Jack? I assure you it won't amuse you a bit."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930537"><said direct="true">"I can't go away without seeing the baby,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, "so I think I'll go with Chesterford, and then I must be off. Good-bye, Dodo. Get well quickly. May I come and see you to-morrow?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930538"><said direct="true">"I wish Chesterford wouldn't take Jack off in that way,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo rather querulously, as they left the room. "Jack came to see me, and I wanted to talk more to him—I'm very fond of Jack. If he wasn't so fearfully lazy, he'd make no end of a splash. But he prefers talking to his friends to talking to a lot of Irish members. I wonder why he came after he said he wouldn't. Jack usually has good reasons."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930539"><said direct="false">Dodo lay back in her chair and reflected.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930540"><said direct="true">"You really are the most unnatural mother,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vivian, with a laugh. "I am glad Mr. Broxton went with your husband, or he would have been disappointed, I think."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930541"><said direct="false">Dodo looked a little anxious.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930542"><said direct="true">"He wasn't vexed, was he?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked. "I hate vexing people, especially Chesterford. But he really is ridiculous about the baby. It is absurd to suppose it is interesting yet."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930543"><said direct="true">"I don't suppose he would call it interesting,"</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Vivian. "But you know there are other things beside that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930544"><said direct="false">Dodo grew a trifle impatient.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930545"><said direct="true">"Ah, that's a twice-told tale,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "I consider I have done my duty admirably, but just now I confess I am pining for a little amusement. I have been awfully dull. You know one can't exist on pure love."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930546"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian rose to go.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930547"><said direct="true">"Well, I must be off,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Good-night, Dodo; and remember this, if ever anything occurs on which you want advice or counsel, come to me for it. You know I have been through all this; and—and remember Lord Chesterford loves you very deeply."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930548"><said direct="false">Dodo looked up inquiringly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930549"><said direct="true">"Yes, of course, I know that,"</said><said direct="false"> she said, "and we get on magnificently together. In any case I should always ask you for advice. You know I used to be rather afraid of you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930550"><said direct="false">Mrs. Vivian stood looking out of the window. Her eyes suddenly filled with tears.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930551"><said direct="true">"Ah, my dear, don't be afraid of me,"</said><said direct="false"> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930552"><said direct="false">Dodo wondered, when she had gone, what made her so suddenly grave. Her own horizon was singularly free from clouds. She had been through an experience which she had looked forward to with something like dread. But that was over; she and the baby were both alive and well. Chesterford was more devoted than ever, and she?—well, she was thoroughly satisfied. And Jack had come back, and all was going delightfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930553"><said direct="true">"They all talk about love as if it were something very dreadful,"</said><said direct="false"> she thought. "I'm sure it isn't dreadful at all. It is rather a bore sometimes; at least one can have enough of it, but that is a fault on the right side."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930554"><said direct="false">The door opened softly, and Chesterford came in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930555"><said direct="true">"I am glad to find you alone, darling,"</said><said direct="false"> he said, "I haven't seen you all day. You are looking much better. Get Jack to come and see you again as soon as he can."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930556"><said direct="false">Dodo smiled benignantly on him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930557"><said direct="true">"The baby really is wonderful,"</said><said direct="false"> he continued. "It was sitting up with its bottle just now, and I really believe it winked at me when it saw me. Do you think it knows me?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930558"><said direct="true">"Oh, I daresay it does,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "it sees enough of you anyhow."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930559"><said direct="true">"Isn't it all wonderful,"</said><said direct="false"> he went on, not noticing her tone. "Just fancy. Sometimes I wonder whether it's all real."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930560"><said direct="true">"It's real enough when it cries,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "But it is rather charming, I do think."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930561"><said direct="true">"It's got such queer little fists,"</said><said direct="false"> said he, "with nice pink nails."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930562"><said direct="false">Dodo laughed rather wearily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930563"><said direct="true">"Are you a little tired, darling?"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "Won't you go to bed? You know you've been up quite a long time. Perhaps you'd like to see the baby before you go."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930564"><said direct="true">"Oh, I said good-night to the baby,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "I think I will go to bed. I wish you'd send Wilkins here."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930565"><said direct="false">He bent over her and kissed her forehead softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930566"><said direct="true">"Ah, my darling, my darling,"</said><said direct="false"> he whispered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930567"><said direct="false">Dodo lay with half-shut eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930568"><said direct="true">"Good-night, dear,"</said><said direct="false"> she said languidly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930569"><said direct="false">The questions about which a man is apt to, say that he alone can judge, are usually exactly those questions in which his judgment is most likely to be at fault, for they concern him very intimately—a truth which he expresses by saying that he alone can judge about them, and for that very reason his emotions are apt to colour what he considers his sober decision.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930570"><said direct="false">Jack was exactly in this position when he left the Chesterfords' door that afternoon. It was only six o'clock when he went away, and he wished to be alone, and to think about it. But the house seemed stuffy and unsuggestive, and he ordered a horse, and sat fuming and frowning till it came round. It fidgeted and edged away from the pavement when he tried to mount it, and he said, "Get out, you brute," with remarkable emphasis, and asked the groom whether he hadn't yet learned to hold a horse quiet. This was sufficient to show that he was in a perturbed frame of mind.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930571"><said direct="false">The Row was rather empty, for a great race meeting was going on, and Jack cantered quickly up to the end, and cursed his stupidity for not having gone to Sandown. Then he put his horse to a quiet pace, and determined to think the matter out.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930572"><said direct="false">He had left the Chesterfords in January with a full realisation of his position. He was in love with Dodo, perhaps more deeply than ever, and Dodo was hopelessly, irrevocably out of his reach. The only thing left to be done was to get over it; but his ordinary circle and its leisurely duties were quite impossible just at present, and he adopted the traditional English method of travelling, and shooting unoffending animals. Whether the absence of faith was responsible, is an open question; at any rate, the remedy did not result in a cure. He was intensely bored with foreign countries; they were quite as distasteful as England, and, on the whole, had less to offer. And he came back to London again as suddenly as he had left it. He only remembered one incident in his four months abroad which gave him any pleasure; that was when he received a letter from Dodo at Berlin, which said nothing particular, and wound up with a little mild chaff on the absurdity of his going abroad at all. "I hope you are really better," wrote Dodo, "though I didn't know that you were in any immediate danger of breaking down when you left us. Anyhow, come back. London is particularly wholesome, and, to tell you the truth, it's just a wee bit dull. Don't be conceited."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930573"><said direct="false">Of course he came back; it was no good remaining abroad, and yawning in front of the Sistine Madonna, who, in her impossible serene mildness, had no message whatever for him. He wanted to see Dodo; why on earth shouldn't he? She was the only thing he really cared about, and she was quite out of his reach. Where was the harm?</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930574"><said direct="false">For two days after his arrival in London he was still undecided, and made no effort to see her, and on the third day her note came. London was as bad as Dresden, and again, where was the harm? He wrote a note saying he would come, then he tore that up and sent a refusal, offering no excuse; and after all, he had gone, and parted from her with the words that he would come again the next day. But ah, how sweet it was to see her again! Such were the facts upon which Jack wished to form a conclusion. All this indecision was really too annoying. What was the use of a conscience that took the sugar out of your tea, and yet could not prevent you from drinking it? It was not strong enough to prevent him going to see Dodo, and it took the malicious line of making the visit as little enjoyable as possible. Well, it must be settled one way or the other.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930575"><said direct="false">The problem obviously depended on one question. Did his desire for Dodo grow stronger with seeing her? He decided that it did not make much difference to the quality or degree of his longing, but, on the other hand, her society gave him an inestimable pleasure. When she had refused him a year ago, he had gone on seeing her day after day, without the horrible, unsatisfied emptiness he had felt abroad. That absorbing craving for her, he remembered, began when she was on her wedding tour. Then why not see her freely and frequently? No harm could possibly come out of it. Dodo, he thought, cared for him only as she cared for a dozen other friends, why should he, then, who cared so deeply for her, cut himself off from her? Again his deep-rooted affection and respect for her husband was an immense safeguard. Quixotism was a doubtful virtue at the best, and decidedly out of date, and besides, what would Dodo think if she suddenly found that one of her best friends invariably declined to meet her under any circumstances? She would certainly guess the reason, and if there was one possible solution of this stupid problem more undesirable than another, it was that. And Jack made up his mind.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930576"><said direct="false">Well, that was settled, and here was Bertie riding down upon him. He felt as if he wished to record a deliberate and sober conclusion. They joined forces and rode up together.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930577"><said direct="false">Then Jack said suddenly,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930578"><said direct="true">"Bertie, I have been making a fool of myself, but I am better now."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930579"><said direct="true">"That's good,"</said><said direct="false"> said Bertie placidly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930580"><said direct="false">There was something indefinably soothing about Bertie's manner. Jack determined to be more explicit. It is often a relief to tell a friend one's own resolutions, especially if one does not expect unseasonable objections.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930581"><said direct="true">"It's about Dodo,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "You see I'm dreadfully in love with her. Awkward, isn't it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930582"><said direct="true">"Devilish,"</said><said direct="false"> said Bertie, without a shade of emotion passing over his face.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930583"><said direct="true">"And the less I see of her,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, "the worse I get, so I've determined that the more I see of her in the ordinary way, the better. It sounds an unusual treatment, I know, but you must acknowledge I gave the other method a fair chance. I went and killed pigs in Austria, and climbed the Matterhorn, but it wouldn't do."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930584"><said direct="false">They rode on a little time in silence. Then Bertie said,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930585"><said direct="true">"Do you want my advice?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930586"><said direct="true">"Well, yes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack rather dubiously.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930587"><said direct="true">"Then I'm dashed if I like it, Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "It's too dangerous. Just think——"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930588"><said direct="false">But Jack broke in,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930589"><said direct="true">"Don't you see my friendship for Chesterford is an absolute safeguard. Dodo gives me more pleasure than anyone I know, and when I can't see her, life becomes unbearable. Chesterford is one of those men to whom one couldn't do a mean thing, and, furthermore, Dodo doesn't love me. If those two facts don't ensure safety, I don't know what would. Besides, Bertie, I'm not a rascal."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930590"><said direct="true">"I can't like it,"</said><said direct="false"> said Bertie. "If one has a propensity for falling into the fire, it's as well to keep off the hearthrug. I know you're not a rascal, but this is a thing one can't argue about. It is a matter of feeling."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930591"><said direct="true">"I know,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, "I've felt it too. But I think it's outweighed by other considerations. If I thought any mischief could come of it, I should deserve to be horse-whipped."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930592"><said direct="true">"I don't like it,"</said><said direct="false"> repeated Bertie stolidly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930593"><said direct="false">Jack went to see Dodo the next afternoon, and for many afternoons during the next fortnight he might have been seen on Chesterford's doorstep, either coming or going. Her husband seemed almost as glad as Dodo that Jack should come often. His visits were obviously very pleasant to her, and she had begun to talk nonsense again as fluently as ever. With Jack, however, she had some rather serious talks; his future appeared to be exercising her mind somewhat. Jack's life at this time was absolutely aimless. Before he had gone abroad he had been at the Bar, and had been called, but his chambers now knew him no more. He had no home duties, being, as Dodo expressed it, "a poor little orphan of six foot two," and he had enough money for an idle bachelor life. Dodo took a very real interest in the career of her friends. It was part of her completeness, as I have said before, to be the centre of a set of successful people. Jack could do very well, she felt, in the purely ornamental line, and she by no means wished to debar him from the ornamental profession, but yet she was vaguely dissatisfied. She induced him one day to state in full, exactly the ideas he had about his own future.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930594"><said direct="true">"You dangle very well indeed,"</said><said direct="false"> she said to him, "and I'm far from wishing you not to dangle, but, if it's to be your profession, you must do it more systematically. Lady Wrayston was here yesterday, and she said no one ever saw you now. That's lazy; you're neglecting your work."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930595"><said direct="false">Jack was silent a few minutes. The truth of the matter was that he was becoming so preoccupied with Dodo, that he was acquiring a real distaste for other society. His days seemed to have dwindled down to an hour or two hours each, according to the time he passed with Dodo. The interval between his leaving the house one day and returning to it the next, had got to be merely a tedious period of waiting, which he would gladly have dispensed with. In such intervals society appeared to him not a distraction, but a laborious substitute for inaction, and labour at any time was not congenial to him. His life, in fact, was a series of conscious pulses with long-drawn pauses in between. He was dimly aware that this sort of thing could not go on for ever. The machine would stop, or get quicker or slower, and there were endless complications imminent in either case.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930596"><said direct="true">"I don't know that I really care for dangling,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack discontentedly. "At the same time it is the least objectionable form of amusement."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930597"><said direct="true">"Well, you can't dangle for ever in any case,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You ought to marry and settle down. Chesterford is a sort of apotheosis of a dangler. By performing, with scrupulous care, a quantity of little things that don't matter much, like being J.P., and handing the offertory plate, he is in a way quite a busy man, to himself at least, though nothing would happen if he ceased doing any or all of these things; and the dangler, who thinks himself busy, is the happiest of men, because he gets all the advantages of dangling, and none of the disadvantages, and his conscience—have you got a conscience, Jack?—so far from pricking him, tells him he's doing the whole duty of man. Then again he's married—to me, too. That's a profession in itself."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930598"><said direct="true">"Ah, but I can't be married to you too,"</said><said direct="false"> remarked Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930599"><said direct="true">"You're absurd,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "but really, Jack, I wish you'd marry someone else. I sha'n't think you unfaithful."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930600"><said direct="true">"I don't flatter myself that you would,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack, with a touch of irritation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930601"><said direct="false">Dodo looked up rather surprised at the hard ring in his voice. She thought it wiser to ignore this last remark.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930602"><said direct="true">"I never can quite make out whether you are ambitious or not,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "Now and then you make me feel as if you would rather like to go and live in a small cathedral town——"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930603"><said direct="true">"And shock the canons?"</said><said direct="false"> suggested Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930604"><said direct="true">"Not necessarily; but cultivate sheer domesticity. You're very domestic in a way. Bertie would do admirably in a cathedral town. He'd be dreadfully happy among dull people. They would all think him so brilliant and charming, and the bishop would ask him over to dine at the palace whenever anyone came down from London."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930605"><said direct="true">"I'm not ambitious in the way of wanting to score small successes,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack. "Anyone can score them. I don't mind flying at high game and missing. If you miss of course you have to load again, but I'd sooner do that than make a bag of rabbits. Besides, you can get your rabbits sitting, as you go after your high game. But I don't want rabbits."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930606"><said direct="true">"What is your high game?"</said><said direct="false"> asked Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930607"><said direct="false">Jack considered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930608"><said direct="true">"It's this,"</said><said direct="false"> he said. "You may attain it, or at any rate strive after it, by doing nothing, or working like a horse. But, anyhow, it's being in the midst of things, it's seeing the wheels go round, and forming conclusions as to why they go round, it's hearing the world go rushing by like a river in flood, it's knowing what everyone thinks about, it's guessing why one woman falls in love with one man, and why another man falls in love with her. You don't get that in cathedral towns. The archdeacon's daughter falls in love with the dean's son, and nobody else is at all in love with either of them. The world doesn't rattle in cathedral towns, they take care to oil it; the world doesn't come down in flood in cathedral towns, there is nothing so badly regulated as that. I don't know why I should choose cathedral towns particularly to say these things about. I think you suggested that I should live in one. If you like you can plunge into the river in flood and go down with it—that's what they call having a profession—but it's just as instructive to stand on the bank and watch it; more instructive, perhaps, because you needn't swim, and can give your whole attention to it. On the whole, that is what I mean to do."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930609"><said direct="true">"That's good, Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "but you're not consistent. The fact that you haven't been going out lately, shows that you're standing with your back to it, with your hands in your pocket. After all, what you say only conies to this, that you are interested in the problem of human life. Well, there's just as much human life in your cathedral town."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930610"><said direct="true">"Ah, but there's no go about it,"</said><said direct="false"> said he. "It's no more like life than a duck pond is to the river in flood."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930611"><said direct="true">"Oh, you're wrong there,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "It goes on just the same, though it doesn't make such a fuss. But in any case you are standing with your back to it now, as I said."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930612"><said direct="true">"I'm going into details, just at present,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930613"><said direct="true">"How do you mean?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930614"><said direct="true">"I'm watching a little bit of it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930615"><said direct="true">"I suppose you mean Chesterford and me. Do you find us very interesting?"</said><said direct="false"> demanded Dodo.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930616"><said direct="true">"Very."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930617"><said direct="false">Jack was rather uncomfortable. He wanted to say more, and wished he hadn't said so much. He wondered how Dodo would take it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930618"><said direct="false">Dodo did not take it at all. She was, for the time at any rate, much more interested in Jack's prospects as they concerned him, than as they bore on herself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930619"><said direct="true">"What is the upshot of all your observations?"</said><said direct="false"> she asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930620"><said direct="false">Jack hardly knew whether to feel relieved or slighted. Was Dodo's apparent unconsciousness of the tenor of what he had said genuine or affected? On that he felt a great deal depended. But whether it was genuine or not, the matter was closed for the present. Dodo repeated her question.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930621"><said direct="true">"My observations on you, or on the world in general?"</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930622"><said direct="true">"Either will do,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo; "we're very normal. Any conclusion you have formed about the rest of the world will apply to us."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930623"><said direct="true">"My conclusion is that you are not quite normal,"</said><said direct="false"> said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930624"><said direct="false">Dodo laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930625"><said direct="true">"Oh, I'm dreadfully normal,"</said><said direct="false"> she said; "all my inconsistencies lie on the surface—I'm married, I've got a baby, I'm honest, I'm lazy. I'm all I should and shouldn't be. And Chesterford——"</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930626"><said direct="true">"Oh, then Chesterford's normal too,"</said><said direct="false"> said Jack.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930627"><said direct="false">June was drawing to a close in a week of magnificent weather. It was too hot to do much during the middle of the day, and the Park was full of riders every morning from eight till ten. Dodo' was frequently to be seen there, usually riding a vicious black mare, that plunged and shied more than Lord Chesterford quite liked. But Dodo insisted on riding it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930628"><said direct="true">"The risks one runs every moment of one's life,"</said><said direct="false"> she told him, "are so many, that one or two more really don't matter. Besides, I can manage the brute."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930629"><said direct="false">On this particular morning Dodo descended the stairs feeling unusually happy. The period of enforced idleness was over, and she was making up for lost time with a vengeance. They had given a dance the night before, and Dodo had not gone to bed till after four; but for all that she was down again at half-past eight, and her mare was waiting for her. She turned into the dining-room to have a cup of tea before starting, and waited somewhat impatiently for Lord Chesterford to join her. He came in, in the course of a few minutes, looking rather worried.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930630"><said direct="true">"You look as if you had not gone to bed for a week,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo, "and your hair is dreadfully untidy. Look at me now. Here I am a weak little woman, and I feel fit to move mountains, and you look as if you wanted quinine and iron. Don't come, if you'd rather not. Stop at home and play with the baby."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930631"><said direct="true">"I'm all right,"</said><said direct="false"> said he, "but I'm rather worried about the boy. The nurse says he's not been sleeping much all night, but kept waking and crying, and he looks rather flushed. I think I'll send for the doctor."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930632"><said direct="false">Dodo felt a little impatient.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930633"><said direct="true">"He's as right as possible,"</said><said direct="false"> she said. "You shouldn't worry so, Chesterford. You've wanted to send for the doctor a hundred times in the last month, either for him or me. But don't come if you'd rather not. Vivy is coming to breakfast at half-past nine; I quite forgot that. If you feel inclined to stop, you might give her breakfast, and I'll lengthen my ride. I shall be back at half-past ten. She's going to take me to see Wainwright's new Turner."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930634"><said direct="true">"Are you sure you don't mind, Dodo?"</said><said direct="false"> said he, still wavering. "If you don't, I really think I will stop, and perhaps see the doctor about him. The nurse says she would like to have the doctor here."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930635"><said direct="true">"Just as you like,"</said><said direct="false"> said Dodo. "You'll have to pay a swinging bill anyhow. Good-bye, old boy. Don't worry your silly old head. I'm sure it's all right."</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930636"><said direct="false">Dodo went off perfectly at ease in her mind. Chesterford was rather fussy, she thought, and she congratulated herself on not being nervous. "A pretty pair we should make if I encouraged him in his little ways," she said to herself. "We should one of us, live in the nursery." She put her horse into a quick trot, and felt a keen enjoyment in managing the vicious animal. The streets were somewhat crowded even at this hour, and Dodo had her work cut out for her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930637"><said direct="false">However, she reached the Park in safety, and went up the Row at a swinging gallop, with her horse tearing at the rein and tossing its head. After a time the brute grew quieter, and Dodo joined a well-known figure who was riding some way in front of her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG18930638"><said direct="true">"Good old Jack,"</said><said direct="false"> she cried, "isn't it splendid! I had no idea how I loved motion and exercise and dancing and all that till I began again. Didn't you think our ball went off rather well? Did you stop, to the end? Oh, of course you did. That silly dowager What's-her-name was quite shocked at me, just because we had the looking-glass figure in the cotillion. It's the prettiest of the lot, I think. Old Major Ewart gave me a pair of ivory castanets with silver mountings last night, the sweetest things in the world. I really think he is seriously gone on me, and he must be sixty if he's an hour. I think I shall appeal to Chesterford for protection. What fun it would be to make Chesterford talk to him gravely like a grandson. He stopped at home this morning to look after the baby. I think I shall get jealous of the nurse, and pretend that he's sweet on her, and that's why he goes to the nursery so much."</said></p>
