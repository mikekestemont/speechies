<said>"Oh! bother to the laying down, Harry,"</said> said the Cracksman. <said>"Don't you think me and Tony wants sleep as well as a strong hearty young feller like you? and we haven't put buff in downy[74] since the night afore last."</said></p>
<p n="2"><said>"What's the meaning of this, Tom?"</said> said the Cracksman's companion, who was no other than the Resurrection Man:<said>"you don't mean to say that you know this fellow?"</said></p>
<p n="3"><said>"Neither does it seem probable that he took her there to make away with her,"</said> said Holford; <said>"for, as the dead tell no tales, there was not any use in binding her eyes."</said></p>
<p n="4">And all this while Morcar, with his mask and bushy yellow hair, and his assistant Mike, were stationed each by one of the stakes to which the net was fixed.</p>
<p n="5"><said>"It is a knock,"</said> said Tidkins; and he hastened down to the street door.</p>
<p n="6"><said>"She cannot be—she cannot be,"</said> answered the old hag; <said>"she would not bear the name of Wilmot if she was. Besides, I have since ascertained that her mother died when she was only four years old; and therefore Katherine was too young to receive any revelation from her parent's lips. No—no: I have good reason to believe that Katherine knows nothing of her paternal origin."</said></p>
<p n="7"><said>"At all events you are not hurt—and that is the essential,"</said> said Lord Rossville.</p>
<p n="8"><said>"It may be,"</said> answered Vernon, quailing not beneath that look—for he had so desperate a part to play at Ravensworth Hall, that he knew how much depended upon a self-command and a collectedness of ideas that might avert suspicion,—<said>"it may be, sister, that some years ago—ere I left England—we met in those circles in which we both move by right of birth and social position; and, although I do not remember that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you until now, still such a meeting may have occurred, and your mind may have retained certain impressions——"</said></p>
<p n="9"><said>"Mr. Monroe is waiting for you at your own house at Holloway,"</said> said Whittingham to his young master, when the first ebullition of joy was over. <said>"He has been ailing lately—and he thought that this happy and fortitudinous event would be too much for his nerves."</said></p>
<p n="10">When she was young she had lived by the sale of herself: now that she was old she lived by the sale of others.</p>
<p n="11">The room itself was furnished in the most luxurious manner. The rosewood tables were inlaid with mother of pearl: the chairs were of antique form, with high backs carved in the most exquisite manner;—the mirrors were large, the pictures numerous, and all set in magnificent frames;—and the toilette-table was of the most elegant and costly description.</p>
<p n="12">The first was to Mrs. Arlington, and ran thus:—</p>
<p n="13"><said>"On my return to the Place,"</said> continued Katherine, <said>"I acquainted Mr. Monroe and Ellen with the particulars of the interview between the undertaker and myself; and as your letter, announcing the day when you hoped to set foot on the English soil again, had arrived that very morning, it was arranged that no decisive step should be taken until you were present to advise and to sanction the course to be adopted. I accordingly wrote a note to Mr. Banks, stating that I would communicate with him in a positive manner in the course of a week or ten days."</said></p>
<p n="14">"Your affectionate Sister,</p>
<p n="15"><said>"This is awkward—very awkward,"</said> said Chichester, when the cloth was removed, and the two gentlemen were occupied with their wine.</p>
<p n="16"><said>"I see that you do not know me, sir,"</said> continued Lydia, approaching close to Colonel Cholmondeley: then, fixing her eyes intently upon him, she said, <said>"Do you remember me now?"</said></p>
<p n="17"><said>"I am glad of that,"</said> continued the young man. <said>"If I only knew three or four more such gay, dashing, good-hearted fellows as you all are, I should be as contented as possible. By the way, Chichester, I will tell you a very odd thing."</said></p>
<p n="18">The morning paper was late; and his lordship was one of those persons who cannot enjoy their repast without the intellectual association of a journal.</p>
<p n="19">At length the gloomy and sombre-looking hulks off Woolwich are reached: the boat shoots in between the shipping; and there the pirates landed.</p>
<p n="20">It was now quite dusk; and our hero signified his intention of taking his departure. He confided the morocco case containing Armstrong's letter, to his excellent friend, the banker, and at the same time expressed his deep gratitude for all the kindness he had experienced at the hands of that gentleman and his sister.</p>
<p n="21">By the light of the lamp he soon distinguished a policeman, walking with slow and measured steps along his beat.</p>
<p n="22">Oh! it was too much for that haughty—that vain—that self-sufficient ecclesiastic to endure!</p>
<p n="23">The turnkey accordingly led the way through the wicket of a strong iron grating, across a yard where a watchman armed with a loaded blunderbuss was stationed, and thence into a building, up the narrow stone staircase of which the party proceeded, until they reached a cell, where the Resurrection Man, who was now released from his bonds, was left.</p>
<p n="24"><said>"Wretch—miscreant—murderer!"</said> exclaimed Richard; <said>"nothing shall now prevent me from securing you on the behalf of justice."</said></p>
<p n="25">When the dancing was over, a second juggler balanced first a blue plate, and then the basin, on the point of a long stick—making them spin rapidly round, to the especial delight of the female servants. The nurse, too, was so very much amused that she crossed the threshold of the window, and advanced a little upon the balcony, the better to view the performance.</p>
<p n="26">The hag contemplated her for some time in silence, and then exclaimed, <said>"Your appearance has improved; you have a tinge of the carnation upon your cheeks; and your eyes have recovered their brightness. I know an artist of great repute, who will be glad of you as a copy for his shepherdesses, his huntresses, his sea-nymphs, and heathen goddesses. Let us lose no time in proceeding to his residence."</said></p>
<p n="27"><said>"Oh! no—not London!"</said> exclaimed Katherine, recoiling from the name in horror.</p>
<p n="28"><said>"Let 'em search it,"</said> ejaculated Flairer: <said>"they'll on'y do it once; and who cares for that? You can lie as snug down stairs for a week or so as if you was a thousand miles off. Besides, who'd think for a instant that you'd hide yourself in the wery spot that the young feller could point out as one of our haunts? Mark me, Bill—if yer goes up to Rat's Castle in Saint Giles's, you would find too many tongues among them cursed Irishers to ask 'Who is he?' and 'What is he?' If you goes over to the Mint, you'll be sure to be twigged by a lot o' them low buzgloaks and broken-down magsmen as swarms there; and they'll nose upon you for a penny. Whitechapel back-slums isn't safe; for the broom-gals, the blacks, and the ballad singers which occupies all that district, is always a quarrelling; and the blue-bottles is constantly poking their nose in every crib in consekvence. Here you are snug; and I can bring you your grub and tell you the news of an evenin' arter dark."</said></p>
<p n="29"><said>"I would in a minute,"</said> answered the Resurrection Man. <said>"Nothing dare, nothing have."</said></p>
<p n="30"><said>"Come, enough of this folly,"</said> said Sir Rupert, impatiently: <said>"we shall have the servants here in a moment. Perhaps you and this gentleman," </said>he continued, <said>"will step into that room for a moment, while I open the door for my little companion here."</said></p>
<p n="31">But, ere he took that step, he sate down, with the usual caution which characterises his race, to ponder upon the subject.</p>
<p n="32">This person, who was very reserved and retired in his habits, and seldom associated with his fellow-prisoners, drew Markham aside, and said, <said>"I've taken a liberty with your name; but I know you won't mind it. In a place like this we must help and assist each other."</said></p>
<p n="33"><said>"And shall not I be supremely happy to leave this land with you—to call you my own dear beloved wife—and to bear you away to the sunny climes of the south of Europe, where we may live in peace, happiness, and tranquillity to the end of our days?"</said></p>
<p n="34"><said>"The laudanum was not for me,"</said> answered Mr. Tracy, calmly: <said>"nor did I order my poor housekeeper to obtain any."</said></p>
<p n="35"><said>"And now, my poor friend,"</said> said Markham, wiping away a tear, while Gibbet's eyes were streaming, <said>"you are without a companion—without a parent; and the many acts of kindness you showed to my sister when she was dependant on your father's bounty, have created for you deep sympathies in the hearts of those who will now endeavour to solace you in your present affliction."</said></p>
<p n="36"><said>"What's bred in the bone will never go out of the flesh,"</said> observed the Superintendent. <said>"But the poor creeturs must have some diwersion. Put that down, Crisp."</said></p>
<p n="37"><said>"Don't blow any more, Mr. Tidkins—save yourself the trouble,"</said> said the hag, now really alarmed. <said>"I will make terms with you."</said></p>
<p n="38"><said>"You had better retire for the present,"</said> said the surgeon. <said>"He is in a high fever—produced, perhaps, by this interview with you, under such circumstances. Do not think of seeing him again this evening: to-morrow evening he will be better and more composed."</said></p>
<p n="39"><said>"Oh! a barber—eh?"</said> said the Home Secretary, yawning.</p>
<p n="40"><said>"I invented certain excuses, sir,"</said> was Holford's reply, <said>"which completely damped their ardour in the matter alluded to. And now, sir, will you give me a trial? I feel convinced you will: had I not thought so from the very beginning, I should not have spoken so freely as I have done."</said></p>
<p n="41"><said>"Yes—yes, uncle,"</said> said Katherine, hastily.</p>
<p n="42"><said>"Well,"</said> said the Resurrection Man, <said>"have you made up your mind, old woman? Because me and my friend Banks are pretty tired of this delay; and if the solitary system won't do—why, we must try what good can be effected by starvation."</said></p>
<p n="43"><said>"And now, farewell—at least for the present; and believe that no one will be more delighted to hear of your success in life, than "</said>Your very sincere friend,</p>
<p n="44">The baronet instantly comprehended the nature of the business which this individual had to address him upon; and making him a significant sign, he said to Chichester, <said>"Do you and Mr. Egerton go very slowly along the Strand; and I will follow you in a few minutes. I have a word to say to this gentleman."</said></p>
<p n="45">He said nothing; but, as he drank in all that fell from his father's lips, two large tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p n="46"><said>"Well—this is singular:—blow me if it ain't!"</said> cried the Cracksman. <said>"Another person found me out jist in the same way this wery morning, only, and he wants a little private job done for him. But that's for to-morrow night. Howsomever, I never blab to one, of what I have done or am going to do for another. You to-night—him to-morrow night! Arter all, the landlord's a fool to talk so free: how did he know you wasn't a trap in disguise?"</said></p>
<p n="47">Adeline wiped her eyes, rang the bell, and reseating herself, assumed as composed a manner as possible under the circumstances.</p>
<p n="48">And throughout the vast metropolis was he already spoken of as the man who had murdered his wife!</p>
<p n="49"><said>"What do you mean, Ellen?"</said></p>
<p n="50">Mr. Greenwood wrote as follows:—</p>
<p n="51"><said>"I know it—I know it,"</said> returned the old man in a weak and hollow voice. <said>"If you had not been a kind master to me, I should never have done all that for you. But, tell me,—and tell me truly," </said>added Michael, fixing his glassy eyes upon the stock-broker, <said>"do you think that these persons—the surgeon, and that hideous man who—"</said></p>
<p n="52">And then a fearful scene took place.</p>
<p n="53">Eliza Sydney was suddenly interrupted by an exclamation which came from the lips of Gilbert Vernon.</p>
<p n="54">At first the conversation languished somewhat, the ladies being abashed and reserved in the presence of a stranger; but as they grew warmed by degrees with the generous wine, their tongues were unlocked; and in half an hour they rattled and chatted away as if they had never known restraint.</p>
<p n="55">Whether he thus prospered to the end, the sequel of our tale must show.</p>
<p n="56"><said>"Dat vare excellent bird—how you call him? Peasant—ah!"</said> observed Baron Torkemdef to the young clergyman, who, like a child, saw, heard, but said nothing. <said>"But after all it no use for to praise one ting or to blame anoder—'cause dem each de idea—de fancy. Dere really no table—no peasant—no wine—no peoples: it all de imagination."</said></p>
<p n="57">Lafleur made his appearance.</p>
<p n="58">And in another minute the parlour of the boozing-ken reverberated with the intonations of the following strange song:—</p>
<p n="59"><said>"Assuredly,"</said> replied the fashionable preacher, who during this colloquy had gradually drawn his chair closer to that of the young maiden. <said>"The gentleman, to whom I have before alluded, called upon me yesterday. It appears he learnt from the policeman that you had been educated at the school in my district, and that my housekeeper was well acquainted with you. He nobly offered to contribute a sum of money towards settling you in some comfortable manner."</said></p>
<p n="60">Those emblems of the fraternal affection of early years were green, verdant, and flourishing; and on the one which had been planted by the hands of the long-lost brother, were the following inscriptions:—</p>
<p n="61"><said>"Because the father of the chevalier was put to death in Austria for coining—or rather upon a charge of coining,"</said> answered the countess; <said>"and although his innocence was discovered and proclaimed a few years after his death, I should not like to have amongst my ancestors a man who had been criminally convicted, however innocent he may in reality have been."</said></p>
<p n="62"><said>"My poor brother, were he alive, would be of age on the 25th,"</said> observed the lady, mournfully.</p>
<p n="63"><said>"What! poor creatures which goes to the workus!"</said> cried Mrs. Smith, revolting at the idea.</p>
<p n="64">Immediately after the explosion, and while Markham and the officer were yet speaking, a bright column of fire shot up into the air:—millions and millions of sparks, glistening vividly, showered down upon the scene of havoc;—for a moment—a single moment—the very heavens seemed on fire;—then all was black—and silent—and doubly sombre.</p>
<p n="65"><said>"She is, indeed!"</said> exclaimed Greenwood. <said>"Tall, elegant, and graceful."</said></p>
<p n="66">The Monday fixed upon for the excursion arrived; and at eleven o'clock in the forenoon a huge yellow barouche, commonly called "a glass-coach," rattled up to the door of Mr. Egerton's lodgings in Stratton Street. The driver of this vehicle had put on his best clothes, which were, however, of a seedy nature, and gave him the air of an insolvent coachman; and the pair of horses which it was his duty to drive seemed as if they had been purchased at least six months previously by a knacker who had, nevertheless, mercifully granted them a respite during pleasure.</p>
<p n="67">One was Tom the Cracksman; the other was a rogue of the same stamp, and was known amongst his confederates in crime by the name of the Buffer. It was this man's boast that he never robbed any one without stripping him to the very skin; and as a person in a state of nudity is said to be <said>"in buff,"</said> the origin of his pseudonym is easily comprehended.</p>
<p n="68">Miss Maria Augusta Victoria Amelia Hyacintha Villiers had been residing with her cousin Adeline, ever since the marriage of the latter with Lord Ravensworth; and it was to consummate the sacrifice ere now alluded to that all the grand preparations before mentioned were in progress. Lord and Lady Rossville and Lady Ravensworth all conceived that Lord Ravensworth would be benefited by the excitement attending the assemblage of a marriage party at the Hall; and their expectations appeared to be in some measure justified. His lordship descended at an unusually early hour to his cabinet, and, instead of having recourse to his meerschaum, he summoned the butler, to whom he gave instructions relative to the service of particular wines.</p>
<p n="69"><said>"Tell him I'll send round the money to-morrow,"</said> shouted a masculine voice inside. <said>"I know it's the collector, because he's rapping at every house."</said></p>
<p n="70">This was a signal for the revellers to retire.</p>
<p n="71">Then, by an extraordinary and almost superhuman effort, he raised himself upon his legs: but they seemed to bend under him.</p>
<p n="72"><said>"Oh! Richard, will you really depart? will you venture on this expedition, so fraught with danger?"</said> cried Isabella, now giving way to her grief as the moment of separation drew nigh. <said>"I told you to hope—I wished to console you; but it is I who require consolation when about to say farewell to you! Oh! Richard, if you knew what anguish now fills my heart, you would be enabled to estimate all my love for you!"</said></p>
<p n="73"><said>"Most assuredly I will,"</said> returned Markham emphatically. <said>"And when I think of all that you have told me, my good lad," continued Richard, </said><said>"I am inclined to believe that you yourself would have been a victim to those wretches."</said></p>
<p n="74">The evident rapidity with which he intended his movements to be characterised, created a most favourable impression not only amongst the inhabitants of Estella, but also with the troops under his command; and though they all deemed him eminently worthy of the post to which he had been raised, yet few foresaw the future greatness of that hero who was destined to take his place amongst the most brilliant warriors of the age.</p>
<p n="75"><said>"He did."</said></p>
<p n="76"><said>"Yes—or no, without further wrangling? You must be well aware that this sacrifice is necessary if the girl is worth having."</said></p>
<p n="77"><said>"Yes—yes: it must be so!"</said> exclaimed Adeline, stifling all feelings of compunction: then taking from beneath her cloak a heavy bag, she threw it upon the table, the chink of gold sounding most welcome to the ears of the Resurrection Man. <said>"That bag contains a hundred sovereigns,"</said> she continued: <said>"it is only an earnest of what I will give if you consent to serve me precisely in the manner which I shall point out."</said></p>
<p n="78"><said>"At the end of the passage——"</said> murmured the gardener.</p>
<p n="79">The idea of meeting his well-beloved brother now alone occupied his mind:—the hope of seeing and even succouring the wanderer banished every other consideration.</p>
<p n="80">The bank on which Markham now walked backwards and forwards, and which constituted the verge of the region of Globe Town, was higher than the opposite one; and the canal, swollen by the rains, had deluged many parts of that latter shore.</p>
<p n="81">And, as he spoke, his countenance was animated with an expression of diabolical triumph.</p>
<p n="82">This document he handed to Richard, who found that it was an autograph letter from the Grand Duke to the General, written at the time when the military disturbances occurred at Montoni. It remonstrated with General Grachia for refusing to countersign the ordinance decreeing the disbandment of the three regiments, and promising him the rank of Marquis and the Premiership if he would but consent to aid his Serene Highness in carrying out the proposed rigorous measures.</p>
<p n="83"><said>"Ah! now I comprehend the cause of your intimacy with Miss Monroe,"</said> said the hag, hastily: <said>"she resides with her father at the house of Mr. Richard Markham. And so," </said>she continued in a musing tone,—<said>"and so that same Mr. Richard Markham is your friend—your benefactor?"</said></p>
<p n="84"><said>"Lydia—I beg you—I implore you—on my knees I beseech you to have mercy upon me!"</said> cried Adeline, clasping her hands together in a paroxysm of ineffable anguish, and falling at the feet of the stern and relentless woman whom she had wronged.</p>
<p n="85"><said>"At least we shall be together!"</said> exclaimed the unfortunate mother, to whom the three little children clung with all the tenacity of sincere affection.</p>
<p n="86"><said>"I don't recollect."</said></p>
<p n="87">The policeman immediately left the cabin.</p>
<p n="88"><said>"We have met, dear father,"</said> answered Isabel, wiping away a tear; <said>"and—we have separated—perhaps," </said>she added in a faltering tone, <said>"never to meet again. Oh! be not angry with him—nor with me, my dearest parents,—especially not with him!"</said></p>
<p n="89">Mr. Greenwood's meditations were interrupted by the entrance of Lord Tremordyn.</p>
<p n="90"><said>"Is your Highness hurt?"</said> asked one of the officers.</p>
<p n="91">A sudden glow of animation flushed her cheek:—was it a light that dawned in upon her soul?</p>
<p n="92">And towards him were turned hundreds of bright eyes; and the glances of fair maids dwelt upon his countenance rather than on their books.</p>
<p n="93"><said>"I never was in a sentimental humour before to-night—not for many, many years,"</said> resumed the young woman; <said>"and I don't know what's making me talk as I am now."</said></p>
<p n="94">In an incredibly short time, and by dint of a forced march which put the mettle of his troops to a severe test,—at which, however, they did not repine, for they were animated by the dauntless courage and perseverance of their commander.—Richard Markham arrived beneath the walls of Villabella.</p>
<p n="95"><said>"Much as the Princess will grieve to separate from her parents——"</said></p>
<p n="96"><said>"We must expect that such will be the case—for some days to come,"</said> returned the surgeon, with the coolness of a professional man who saw nothing extraordinary in such results following so strange a resuscitation from a death-like trance.</p>
<p n="97"><said>"Well—you may call it by that name, if you like,"</said> said Tidkins, with the most provoking calmness. <said>"I don't hesitate to admit that I have now and then walked off with a small picture—or a time-piece—or a mantel ornament—or what not—just to raise supplies for the time being. But you ought to be very much obliged to me that I've left any thing at all in the whole place. Such forbearance isn't quite in keeping with my usual disposition."</said></p>
<p n="98"><said>"I shall not stir out for another hour."</said></p>
<p n="99">He accordingly left the room, quite bewildered by the injurious suspicions which had arisen in the mind of his mistress against his honesty; for he had spoken naught save the plain truth when he declared that the disappearance of the pictures and ornaments had never been observed by either himself or his wife.</p>
<p n="100"><said>"Heaven protect me! it is but too True!"</said> cried Cecilia; and, throwing herself upon her knees before the lawyer, she almost shrieked the words, <said>"You would not give me up to justice, sir—you will not betray me?"</said></p>
<p n="101">As this idea flashed to his mind, he cast a rapid glance towards the old woman; and surprised her as she herself was scrutinising his countenance with the most intense interest, while she was all the time pretending to be listlessly rocking her self.</p>
<p n="102">A few hours afterwards, the following letter was delivered at Markham Place by the postman:—</p>
<p n="103">It was six o'clock in the evening; and he was evidently waiting for some one.</p>
<p n="104"><said>"I have indeed, Ellen,"</said> was the reply; <said>"and amongst them may be reckoned your escape from his snares, when he had you carried away to his house in the country."</said></p>
<p n="105"><said>"The coward!"</said> cried Swot: <said>"such a prize as this is worth any risk."</said></p>
<p n="106">A pile of stones was near the brink.</p>
<p n="107"><said>"My dear wife—my beloved daughter,"</said> he said, advancing towards them, and taking the hand of each in his own, <said>"my worst fears are confirmed. The bank will not pay one sixpence of dividend: Greenwood has contrived to get his fellow-conspirator clear of the tribunal; and the creditors have not a hope left. It was with the greatest difficulty that I could so far master my feelings as to avoid an interference in those most iniquitous proceedings. But my position—my rank forbade me from attempting aught to expose those villains. And now, my dear wife—now, my charming Isabella—prepare yourselves to hear the worst. We are ruined!"</said></p>
<p n="108"><said>"Forgive me, Reginald,"</said> murmured Cecilia, casting her arms around him; <said>"but I was afraid you were unfaithful to me."</said></p>
<p n="109"><said>"Well,"</said> said Mr. Tedworth Jones, his whole countenance becoming as red as his hair, so that it seemed as if he were about to go off in a state of spontaneous combustion; <said>"I did venture to print little piece a few weeks ago."</said></p>
<p n="110"><said>"I am not quite such a fool,"</said> returned Tidkins. <said>"And mind you do not attempt to deceive me with any inventions for I shall deuced soon be able to tell whether your history tallies with all I overheard you and Katherine say together on the subject. Besides, the written proofs must be forthcoming—and they, too, must fully corroborate all you state. Fail in any one of these conditions—and, by Satan! I'll cut your throat from ear to ear. Do you agree?"</said></p>
<p n="111">And now on the sofa in that parlour sate Eliza Sydney herself,—dressed in deep mourning.</p>
<p n="112"><said>"At four o'clock I shall go out in the cab: you can then pay a visit to Upper Clapton and ascertain by any indirect means you can light upon, whether Miss Sydney still inhabits the villa, and whether she still pursues the same retired and secluded mode of existence as when you last made inquiries in that quarter."</said></p>
<p n="113"><said>"'Cos if you was to print all that you've been tellin' me, you'd make the fortunes of them new cemetries that's opened all round London, and the consekvence would be that the grounds in London would have to shut up shop."</said></p>
<p n="114">Arrived on the first landing to which it led, he listened attentively at the various doors which opened from it.</p>
<p n="115">But if these instances of outbreaking revenge—if these ebullitions of indomitable resentment do now and then occur, no small portion of the blame must be charged against that aristocracy which maintains itself on an eminence so immeasurably above the depths in which the masses are compelled to languish. And when the poor creature who is goaded to desperation, does strike—can we wonder if, in the madness of his rage, he deals his blows indiscriminately, or against an innocent person? He may even aim at royalty itself—although, in every really constitutional country, the sovereign is little more than a mere puppet, the Prime Minister of the day being the virtual ruler of the nation.</p>
<p n="116"><said>"I had no opportunity to explain the circumstances that had occurred,"</said> continued the nobleman, after a pause. <said>"Your father disappeared with the rapidity of lightning; and the moment he was gone, Harriet burst from my arms, evidently in pursuit of him. I was so bewildered with the suddenness of these events, that I remained transfixed as it were to the spot. At length I hurried down the street after Harriet;—but I could not overtake her. Distressed beyond measure, I returned home, vented my wrath upon the old woman, whom I loathed as the authoress of this misfortune, and drove her from my house. The wretch wrote to me afterwards, and even endeavoured to obtain an interview with me; but I would never see her more."</said></p>
<p n="117">Scarcely had these words issued from the lips of the burglar, when the door was thrown open, and Montague entered the room.</p>
<p n="118"><said>"Your punishment seems only to have just begun,"</said> retorted Lydia, ever ready to plunge a fresh dagger into the soul of the unhappy lady.</p>
<p n="119">Mr. Greenwood glanced complacently around, and then drew forth a printed slip, the contents of which were as follow:—</p>
<p n="120"><said>"Where is that scoundrel?"</said> cried the farmer, now finding leisure to think of the cause of his wife's sudden indisposition.</p>
<p n="121"><said>"I cannot explain all that, Miss: attend to what I choose to tell you—or may tell you—and you will act wisely,"</said> returned the old woman. <said>"He is a desperate man—and I dare not offend him. He wants money; and money he must have—money he must have!"</said></p>
<p n="122"><said>"Oh! I've no doubt they're all right, my lord,"</said> said Banks, grasping the treasure now handed to him; <said>"but I'll just look over 'em—merely for form's sake. It's more business-like. And nice new flimsies they are, too,"</said> continued the undertaker, as he scrutinised the notes one by one. <said>"Ah! what miserable wessels we should be without money, my lord—in this wicked world;—and what would become of us if our friends had no cash to buy us nice coffins when we are blessed defunct carkisses? It's awful to think of! Four fifties—two hundreds—and ten tens: that's five hundred—sure enow."</said></p>
<p n="123">We said that it was New Year's Day, 1839.</p>
<p n="124"><said>"And now you know all. Can you assist me?"</said></p>
<p n="125">Cowering within himself, he uttered not another word, but stole away, completely subdued—cruelly humiliated.</p>
<p n="126">Not the rich and luscious loveliness of Diana Arlington, whom circumstances had made his own,—not the matured and exuberant charms of Eliza Sydney, who had escaped his snares,—not the bewitching beauty of Ellen Monroe, from whose brow he had plucked the diadem of purity,—nor the licentious fascinations of Lady Cecilia Harborough, who sold herself to him for his gold,—not all these had so stirred his heart, so inflamed his ardent imagination, as the spectacle which he now beheld.</p>
<p n="127">Then, recovering from the state of uneasy suspense into which that incident had thrown him, he rose from the floor, and hurried into the passage which divided the two rows of cells.</p>
<p n="128"><said>"I understand, sir,"</said> answered Lafleur. <said>"Any further commands?"</said></p>
<p n="129"><said>"No luck, I suppose, sir?"</said> observed another. <said>"You had much better have remained with us and given us some idea of the person that you want."</said></p>
<p n="130"><said>"Speak,"</said> said the clergyman, somewhat impatiently, for he longed to be left alone again with his reflections, which had just assumed a most voluptuous complexion when his privacy was thus intruded upon.</p>
<p n="131">We have before said that Markham was not a coward—far from it; and he moreover experienced a lively curiosity to satisfy himself concerning the fate of an individual whose inveterate malignity had so frequently menaced not only his dearest interests, but his life.</p>
<p n="132"><said>"Margaret,"</said> he said, in a solemn tone, <said>"you are now in the presence of the secret tribunal of the united races of Zingarees. Our association, existing by conventional rules and laws of its own making, and to a certain degree independent of those which govern the country wherein we dwell, has been compelled to frame severe statutes to meet extreme cases. One of our customs is hospitality; and you have seen enough of us to know that we ask but few questions of those who seek our charity or our protection. It necessarily happens that persons who so come amongst us, learn much of our mode of life and many of our proceedings. But the basest ingratitude alone could reward our generous hospitality with a treacherous betrayal of any matters, the communication of which might militate against our interests. Although we have no sympathy and no dealings with the thieves and rogues of this great metropolis, we never refuse them the security of this establishment, when accident or previous acquaintance with its existence leads them to seek the safety of its walls. This conduct on our part has been pursued upon grounds of generosity and policy;—generosity, because we believe that half the criminals in existence are rather the victims of bad laws than of their own perverse natures;—policy, because we wish to keep on good terms with all orders and classes who live in violation of the law. It, however, behoves us to adopt as much precaution as possible against treachery, and to punish treachery where we detect it, and when the perpetrator of it is in our power. With this view the secret tribunal was instituted at the same time that this establishment was first opened, more than a century ago. Margaret, you are now in the presence of that tribunal, and you are accused of treachery and ingratitude of the very blackest dye."</said></p>
<p n="133"><said>"Pardon—pardon, dearest one!"</said> he said in a harried and subdued tone.</p>
<p n="134"><said>"Yes, sir,"</said> said the host, and hurried from the room.</p>
<p n="135">The Buffer removed the sack from the body, which he then stretched out at length upon the inclined table, taking care to place its head on the higher extremity and immediately beneath the pulley.</p>
<p n="136"><said>"My God!"</said> whispered the lady: <said>"I hear a step ascending!"</said></p>
<p n="137">Here he turned with a most dolorous expression of countenance towards Mrs. Bennet.</p>
<p n="138"><said>"Oh! no—no—that must not be!"</said> exclaimed Stephens. <said>"Speak—I will do your bidding."</said></p>
<p n="139"><said>"Lafleur,"</said> said the fashionable gentleman to the French valet, <said>"you must dismiss that fellow John to-morrow morning."</said></p>
<p n="140">But as a set-off against these disappointments he had one consolation—a consolation which to a less avaricious mind would have been more than commensurate with the losses that Tidkins deplored. He was possessed of Lady Ravensworth's valuable casket of jewels, which he had removed, a few days after he had obtained it in the manner already described, to his house in Globe Town.</p>
<p n="141">Then, holding the light in such a manner that its beams fell upon the floor, and withdrawing his arm from Adeline's waist, he exclaimed in a tone of ferocious triumph, <said>"Behold the remains of the murdered Lydia Hutchinson!"</said></p>
<p n="142">The pawnbroker points to thee and says, <said>"Whilst thy dominion lasts, I am sure to thrive."</said></p>
<p n="143"><said>"Three months! and what is that? A mere nothing!"</said> cried Mr. Greenwood. <said>"You can satisfy yourself of my friend's sincerity."</said></p>
<p n="144">The two gentlemen then broached another bottle of Burgundy; and Mr. Greenwood conversed with even more sprightliness than usual. Indeed, the count fancied that he had never found his host so agreeable and entertaining.</p>
<p n="145"><said>"Then let us banish from our conversation the disagreeable topic which has hitherto engrossed it,"</said> exclaimed Adeline. <said>"It is my duty to give you some information in respect to certain matters; and the family solicitor will, when you may choose to call upon him, enter into more elaborate details. You are aware that your poor brother died ere his child was born. But so far back as last November his lordship made a will the provisions of which were so prudentially arranged as to apply to the welfare of either male or female progeny, whichever might be accorded by Providence. Two distinguished noblemen are now my son's guardians, under that will, and consequently the trustees of the entailed estate."</said></p>
<p n="146">And, oh! with what feelings of profound—ineffable gratitude did Adeline throw herself at the feet of that angel who seemed to have been sent from above to teach her that there was hope for even the greatest criminal, and that <said>"there is more joy in heaven over the repentance of one sinner than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance!"</said></p>
<p n="147"><said>"Of course he does. I shall have to see that his master's pistols are in proper order, and place them in the chaise; but the Italian will take care of his own. There will, consequently, only be one pair loaded with ball."</said></p>
<p n="148"><said>"And after all the pains I have taken in perfecting you in the new dodges with the cards and dice, ready for this season,"</said> said Mr. Chichester, in a most lachrymose tone; then, taking a small parcel from his pocket, he continued, <said>"Here are the implements we want, too: every thing prepared—except the money."</said></p>
<p n="149">The advice of the stock-broker was acted upon; and the fugitives succeeded in leaving the kingdom in safety.</p>
<p n="150">Several weeks glided away; and Markham still remained at Richmond. His acquaintance with the count's family rapidly expanded into an intimacy which gave him unfeigned pleasure. The count treated him as a near relative—almost as a son; the countess was charmed with him because he could converse upon German literature and history;—and where the parents were so encouraging, how could the daughter be reserved? Isabella was naturally of a frank and confiding disposition; and she soon learned to consider Markham as a very intimate friend of the family. Whenever he hinted at the necessity of returning to his own home, he expressed his fears that he was intruding upon the hospitality of his kind hosts, Isabella always had some cause ready to delay his departure, as soon as her father and mother had concluded their own entreaties for him to prolong his visit. Markham had nothing to occupy his attention elsewhere; and he was thus easily induced to remain in a mansion where he received so much kindness, and where there was an attraction that daily disclosed new charms and revealed fresh spells.</p>
<p n="151"><said>"I really thought, sir,"</said> continued the woman, <said>"that the Katherine Wilmot alluded to was perhaps no better than she should be, and had become more intimate with Mr. Tracy than my poor sister suspected. That, I thought, was the reason why she had poisoned my sister in order to get her out of the way, and for herself to remain at Mr. Tracy's house. But I did not think that Mr. Tracy himself had any hand in the murder; and so I did not see the good of producing a letter which would only expose Mr. Tracy."</said></p>
<p n="152">A light was burning upon the table, and when the door opened the Rattlesnake glanced with profound terror in that direction—for she feared lest he should appear in his long dark cloak and black mask. She was inured to crime;—but it was that crime which she could contemplate face to face; and thus the idea that she was in a house where deeds of unknown horror and machinations of an undefined degree of blackness were the business of the terrible man with whom her fortunes were now linked, prostrated all her courage, and filled her with alarms the more profound, because so ominously vague.</p>
<p n="153"><said>"And you changed a five hundred pound note? The clerk did it for your accommodation."</said></p>
<p n="154"><said>"Alas! suicide it must have been, my poor girl,"</said> said the rector; <said>"for who could have administered poison to so harmless, so charitable, so humane a creature? Some secret grief, perhaps——"</said></p>
<p n="155"><said>"It is, indeed, very annoying,"</said> observed Maria, whose sorrows were, however, too deep to permit her mind to be even ruffled by that trifling source of vexation.</p>
<p n="156"><said>"At what time is the sawbones coming down to the grave-yard?"</said> asked Banks.</p>
<p n="157">Richard sincerely hoped so.</p>
<p n="158">"The Committee of Government have therefore ordained, and do ordain, that the style and title of Marquis of Estella be conferred upon the General-in-Chief, the most Excellent Signor Richard Markham.</p>
<p n="159"><said>"Well, Mr. Banks, sir,"</said> said Jones, after reflecting profoundly for some moments, <said>"it's wery lucky that you ain't one o' them chaps which writes books and nonsense."</said></p>
<p n="160">Then, with a considerable amount of circumlocution and elaborate comment, the butler related the conduct of Chichester towards Snoggles, and their accidental meeting that morning.</p>
<p n="161"><said>"I have discovered her secret!"</said> said the rector triumphantly to himself, as he rose and paced the apartment, mad passions raging in his breast; <said>"and that discovery shall make her mine. Oh! no sacrifice were too great to obtain possession of that charming creature! I would give the ten best years of my life to clasp her in my arms, in the revels of love! Happy—thrice happy should I be to feel that lovely form become supple and yielding in my embrace! But my brain burns—my heart beats—my eyes throb—my blood seems liquid fire!"</said></p>
<p n="162"><said>"You are yet too young, Richard,"</said> interrupted Eugene impatiently, <said>"to comprehend the nature of the accusation which I bring against my father. I will, however, attempt to enable you to understand my meaning, so that you may not imagine that I am acting with duplicity when I endeavour to find a means of extenuation, if not of justification, for my own conduct. My father lavished his gold upon my education, as he also did upon yours; and he taught us from childhood to consider ourselves the sons of wealthy parents who would enable their children to move with éclat in an elevated sphere of life. It was just this day year that I joined my regiment at Knightsbridge. I suddenly found myself thrown amongst gay, dissipated, and wealthy young men—my brother officers. Many of them were old acquaintances, and had been my companions at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. They speedily enlisted me in all their pleasures and debaucheries, and my expenditure soon exceeded my pay and my allowance. I became involved in debts, and was compelled to apply to my father to relieve me from my embarrassments. I wrote a humble and submissive letter, expressing contrition for my faults, and promising to avoid similar pursuits in future. Indeed, I was wearied of the dissipation into which I had plunged, and should have profited well by the experience my short career of pleasure and folly had enabled me to acquire. I trembled upon that verge when my father could either ruin or save me. He did not reply to my letter, and I had not courage to seek an interview with him. Again did I write to him: no answer. I had lost money at private play, and had contracted debts in the same manner. Those, Richard, are called debts of honour, and must be paid in full to your creditor, however wealthy he may be, even though your servants and tradesmen should be cheated out of their hard-earned and perhaps much-needed money altogether. I wrote a third time to our father, and still no notice was taken of my appeal. The officers to whom I owed the money lost at play began to look coldly upon me, and I was reduced to a state of desperation. Still I waited for a few days, and for a fourth time wrote to my father. It appears that he was resolved to make me feel the inconvenience of the position in which I had placed myself by my follies; and he sent me no answer. I then called at the house, and he refused to see me. This you know, Richard. What could I do? Driven mad by constant demands for money which I could not pay, and smarting under the chilling glances and taunting allusions of my brother officers, I sold my commission. You are acquainted with the rest. I came home, threw myself at my father's feet, and he spurned me away from him! Richard, was my crime so very great? and has not the unjust, the extreme severity of my father been the cause of all my afflictions?"</said></p>
<p n="163"><said>"We'll go first to Rats' Castle, sir, if you please,"</said> said the policeman: <said>"that is the most likely place for a run-away to take refuge in at random."</said></p>
<p n="164">He then took his departure with a heart far more light than when he had knocked humbly and timidly at the door of that villa an hour before.</p>
<p n="165"><said>"Oh! it is too long to tell you now—we shall only be wasting time; and the villains may escape,"</said> cried Richard, in a tone of excitement and with a wildness of manner which induced the officer to fancy that his brain was turned.</p>
<p n="166"><said>"All that is very True, Chichester,"</said> said the baronet. <said>"But we don't want a homily on the vice of gambling this afternoon: what we require is the needful to enable us to put our plans into execution. The old tricks that you taught me more than three years ago in that very respectable lodging which you occupied in Bartholomew Close, are well-nigh worn out: we have now studied fresh ones;—but we are totally deficient in the steam to set our new engines in motion."</said></p>
<p n="167">The light of the candles that burnt upon the table, fell on the pale and ghastly countenance of old Michael Martin, who lay in that bed, his head propped up with pillows.</p>
<p n="168">Beneath a sofa in the Ball Room of Buckingham Palace, Henry Holford lay concealed.</p>
<p n="169"><said>"Yes—plain enough. It leads to a hole that looks on the ditch. But the plank is quite old and rotten; so I dare say it was put there for some purpose or another a long time ago. Pr'aps the thieves used to convey their swag through that there hole into a boat in the ditch, and——"</said></p>
<p n="170"><said>"And you need not tell old Whittingham that his master is at the station-house."</said></p>
<p n="171"><said>"My dear girl, you cannot think that I have taken all this trouble to be thwarted by a trifling obstacle at the end, or that I have merely had you brought hither to have the pleasure of letting you depart again after one minute's conversation. No, Ellen: listen to me! I have conceived a deep—profound—a fervent affection for you——"</said></p>
<p n="172">The common policeman placed a chair against the outer door of the room, and seated himself in it with the air of a man who meant to say as plainly as he could, <said>"Escape now if you can."</said></p>
<p n="173">THE sessions of the Central Criminal Court commenced.</p>
<p n="174"><said>"Sold—regularly sold—done brown!"</said> returned the Buffer, closing and bolting the door behind him.</p>
<p n="175">A noise was heard in the pantry, which was situate at the back of the house on the same level with the hall.</p>
<p n="176"><said>"That's no business of mine,"</said> returned the principal officer: then, addressing his companion, he said, <said>"Jem, you'll stay here and take a survey of the premises; while I get off with the prisoner. You can follow as soon as you've satisfied yourself whether there's any evidence upon the premises."</said></p>
<p n="177">"The poor people at whose cottage my wife thus breathed her last, were very kind to me. They endeavoured to solace my affliction, and insisted that I should remain with them at least until after the funeral. And if my poor Julia's remains received decent interment,—if she were spared the last ignominy of a parish funeral, which would have crowned all the sad memories that remained to me in respect to her,—it was through the benevolence of those poor people and the surgeon who had been called in.</p>
<p n="178">"Your wishes are attended to in every point. The existence of the child need never be known to either Mr. Monroe or Mr. Richard Markham. Keep faithfully all the secrets which are treasured in your bosom; and I will never desert the child. I will watch over its welfare from a distance: trust to me. You were wrong to hesitate to apply to me. My purse is at all times at your disposal—so long as those secrets remain undivulged.</p>
<p n="179"><said>"That you are not,"</said> replied the executioner. <said>"But I must put a stop to these rovings on his part."</said></p>
<p n="180"><said>"Fine day,"</said> said the gipsy, after quenching his thirst with half the contents of a pint of porter.</p>
<p n="181">The rector gave some more trivial directions, and dismissed his new domestic to her duties.</p>
<p n="182"><said>"We hope that we shall be enabled successfully to assert the popular cause without the loss of life,"</said> returned Morosino. <said>"But this can only be done by means of an imposing force, and not by mere negotiation."</said></p>
<p n="183">A gentle voice breathed an affirmative in his ear; and he pressed his lips to hers to ratify that covenant of two fond hearts.</p>
<p n="184"><said>"I can do nothing for you, miss, since you will not follow my advice,"</said> she said, after a while: <said>"and yet I am acquainted with a statuary who would pay you well for casts of your countenance for his Madonnas, his actresses, his Esmeraldas, his queens, his princesses, and his angels."</said></p>
<p n="185">Both had brilliant teeth, and it was impossible for either to fail to notice this beautiful feature in each other.</p>
<p n="186">When order was once more restored, Markham addressed himself to the two champions who had avenged him in their own peculiar style, and not only thanked them for their well-meant though mistaken kindness, but also gave them munificent proofs of his bounty.</p>
<p n="187"><said>"My emissaries have been successful in every instance,"</said> answered Tunks, with a complacent smile. <said>"A man exactly corresponding with your description of Crankey Jem dwells in an obscure court in Drury Lane. Here is the address."</said></p>
<p n="188">The murderer in the adjoining vault could hear the policemen climb up the plank towards the trap-door; and in a few minutes profound silence again reigned throughout the old house.</p>
<p n="189"><said>"Adieu, my kind—my dear friends,"</said> murmured Mary-Anne. <said>"You must now leave me; and let my father come to receive the last wishes of his daughter."</said></p>
<p n="190">In a word, the members of the royal family of the gipsies appeared to exist upon the most comfortable terms with each other.</p>
<p n="191">"Harriet was not happy in her new place. She found that her mistress was an ill-tempered vixen, and her master a despotic upstart. But an event occurred which entirely changed her gloomy prospects, and enabled her to leave her situation without the necessity of seeking for another. During her walks with the children whom she had to attend upon, she met with a gentleman of middle age, but handsome person and agreeable manners; and some accident, which I have forgotten, made them acquainted. From that time they met every day: the gentleman became deeply enamoured of her, but never once did he make a dishonourable proposal. She told him that she was a poor friendless orphan and he pitied her:—in a short time he learnt to appreciate the purity of her mind—and he loved her. He offered her his hand;—but his pride imposed a condition. He was wealthy—he was a widower—he had two children; and he probably disliked the idea of introducing to the world as his wife one who had been a servant. She was unhappy in her place—without friends—without protectors; and she yielded to his solicitations for a private union. They were married—married at Norwood, where the register will doubtless attest the fact!</p>
<p n="192"><said>"My God! and you were too proud to come to me! Oh! how sincerely—how eagerly would I have offered you the half of all I possess—"</said></p>
<p n="193">Ascending a wide staircase, she reached a landing, where she accosted a nurse who was passing from one room to another at the moment.</p>
<p n="194">It is said that when Perseus carried the hideous head of the Gorgon Medusa through the air, the gore which dripped from it as he passed over the desert of Libya turned into frightful serpents: so does the moral filth which the corruption of great cities distils, engender grovelling and venomous wretches like that old hag.</p>
<p n="195"><said>"Come, Gibbet,"</said> added Smithers; <said>"we've no time to lose. Don't be afraid of your bread-and-butter: you'll get nothing to eat till you come home again to dinner."</said></p>
<p n="196"><said>"You now speak to the point. I candidly confess that I have told you all I suspect or know concerning yourself and your affairs,"</said> proceeded Greenwood; <said>"and I am perfectly indifferent as to whether you choose to enlighten me farther, or not. Doubtless you have some defined course to pursue; or else the aid of the Resurrection Man would be unnecessary. But whether you hope to inherit largely under your deceased brother's will; or whether you can establish claims that may benefit you, in spite of the existence of the infant heir of Ravensworth, who was born a month ago——"</said></p>
<p n="197"><said>"Supper's ready,"</said> she said.</p>
<p n="198"><said>"Thank you, my boy,"</said> said Chichester, and over Markham's shoulder, he exchanged with the baronet a significant glance of satisfaction amounting almost to joy.</p>
<p n="199"><said>"Yes—yes,"</said> answered Smithers. <said>"I'm always punctiwal with the dead as well as the living."</said></p>
<p n="200"><said>"Speak, Miss; I am always ready to do any thing I can for you,"</said> said Marian.</p>
<p n="201">Lafleur entered, and announced Sir Rupert Harborough.</p>
<p n="202"><said>"Really, sir,"</said> exclaimed Mr. Bennet, impatiently, <said>"this is not a very pleasant subject for conversation; and if you have come upon no other business than to recite your Prospectus——"</said></p>
<p n="203"><said>"Yes—pay, pay up to the last farthing!"</said> answered Tomlinson. <said>"An accident—a chance may save us, as oftentimes before! And yet methinks, Michael, that we never stood so near the verge of ruin as we do to-day."</said></p>
<p n="204"><said>"My dear feller,"</said> said Dick, in a hurried tone, <said>"I didn't mean to come back so soon again, but me and Tom is a-going to do a little business together down Southampton way—someot that he has been told of; and as we may be away a few days, I thought I'd better come this evenin' with a fresh supply. Here's plenty of grub, and rum, and bakker."</said></p>
<p n="205">The papers were, however, handed over to Mr. Chichester, who began by reading aloud the following manuscript copy of verses:—</p>
<p n="206"><said>"And when I think of it,"</said> continued Sir Rupert Harborough, <said>"he has often been here for an hour or two together; for I have gone out and left him with Lady Cecilia in the drawing-room; and when I have come back, he has been there still."</said></p>
<p n="207"><said>"You weep, Eliza,"</said> exclaimed Stephens, <said>"you weep for me who am unworthy even of your notice!"</said></p>
<p n="208">The Resurrection Man was well aware that the gipsies had an establishment in that district of London; but he had never been previously acquainted with its precise whereabouts. It, however, now instantly struck him that accident had led him into that very establishment.</p>
<p n="209">The valet then withdrew.</p>
<p n="210">It was ten o'clock at night; and the king of the gipsies was presiding at the banqueting-table in his palace.</p>
<p n="211"><said>"In course you'll make out Newgate a horrid place, sir?"</said> said Crisp.</p>
<p n="212">Mario Bazzano was then presented to his brother-in-law.</p>
<p n="213">All these reflections passed rapidly through her mind while the lawyer was reading the deed of release, not one word of which was attended to by her. She suddenly felt as if her eyes were opened to a fearful conspiracy, in which she was playing a conspicuous part:—she trembled, as if she were standing upon the edge of a precipice;—and yet she knew not how to act. She was bewildered: but the uppermost idea in her mind was that she had gone too far to retreat.</p>
<p n="214"><said>"The prince is expected at five o'clock,"</said> observed the other. <said>"He and his father the Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha, are to land at Woolwich between two and three."</said></p>
<p n="215">His suspicions instantly fixed themselves upon two persons—the only two of his accomplices who were acquainted with the mysteries of the subterranean.</p>
<p n="216">The public-houses in the Old Bailey and the immediate neighbourhood drove a roaring trade throughout that day.</p>
<p n="217"><said>"You know, Miss, that I will do any thing I can to make you happy. Your secret is safe in my keeping."</said></p>
<p n="218"><said>"I do—I do: hours passed—I had gold—and you were absent!"</said> ejaculated the old man, with feverish impatience.</p>
<p n="219"><said>"My name's Tidkins, ma'am—at your service,"</said> answered the Resurrection Man, in as polite a manner as he could possibly assume.</p>
<p n="220"><said>"They might have thought so of Cherry,"</said> cried the captain, colouring deeply, and twirling his moustachios; <said>"but they couldn't have formed such an opinion of me—an officer in her majesty's service—strike, smite, and blow me!"</said></p>
<p n="221"><said>"We can't split the palace into a hundred different bed-chambers,"</said> observed Zingary.</p>
<p n="222"><said>"Well,"</said> proceeded the shrewd Mr. Mac Chizzle, <said>"it wasn't a bad dodge either. And I suppose that this Monroe is a party to the whole concern?"</said></p>
<p n="223"><said>"The deuce you did! And how was he looking?"</said></p>
<p n="224"><said>"Oh! he's fadded[2] that safe enough,"</said> observed the officer in plain clothes. <said>"My eye! What a slap-up lily benjamin[3] he had on when he was nabbed."</said></p>
<p n="225"><said>"Please your ladyship,"</said> he said, <said>"there is a gentleman below who has just been dangerously wounded in a duel; and his companions earnestly request——"</said></p>
<p n="226"><said>"Consolation is to be found in the conviction that the earth is no abiding place,"</said> answered Markham; <said>"and that there is a world beyond."</said></p>
<p n="227"><said>"Worse and worse,"</said> answered the old man, with a species of savage grunt. <said>"We have had a sad time of it for the last three months."</said></p>
<p n="228"><said>"No, Mr. Vernon—stay!"</said> exclaimed Adeline, in a tone which denoted the most painful excitement and agitation.</p>
<p n="229"><said>"That depends. Do you mean to live at my table? I charge sixpence for tea, the same for breakfast, a shilling for dinner, and four-pence for supper."</said></p>
<p n="230">Those words produced an instantaneous change within him: those sweet syllables, uttered in the silvery tones of lovely woman's tenderness—recalled him to himself.</p>
<p n="231"><said>"My dear Cecilia,"</said> he exclaimed, as he entered the room, <said>"a thousand pardons for keeping you; but the fact is that the position in which an intelligent and independent constituency has placed me, entails upon me duties—"</said></p>
<p n="232">With these words he again set off in the direction of the count's abode.</p>
<p n="233"><said>"I will see her once more,"</said> he said, yielding to the influence of his passions: <said>"I will tell her that I stand upon an abyss—I will implore her to have mercy upon me, and permit me to retreat ere yet it be too late!"</said></p>
<p n="234"><said>"If I may be allowed to speak my thoughts in this matter,"</said> said our hero, <said>"I should counsel Katherine to accept a proposition so kindly, so frankly made; and it shall be my duty to see that she becomes not a burden upon the friend who will provide her with a home."</said></p>
<p n="235">The solicitor settled himself in a comfortable manner in his chair, and taking up a deed consisting of several folios, proceeded to make his hearers as much acquainted with its contents as the multifarious redundancies of law terms would allow.</p>
<p n="236">Mr. Banks and the Buffer accompanied the Resurrection Man to his own abode, where they found a copious repast ready to be served up to them by the Rattlesnake. The Buffer's wife was also there; and the party sat down with a determination to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p n="237">Richard and the butler now reached the top of the hill. Eugene was seated upon the bench in a deep reverie; and it was not until his brother and the faithful old domestic stood before him, that he awoke from that fit of abstraction.</p>
<p n="238">Montague returned to his apartment, full of the bliss which he had derived from the caresses enjoyed in a chamber that seemed sacred to mystery and love. He paced his own room with hasty and agitated steps: his brain was on fire.</p>
<p n="239">He then withdrew his hand from her mouth; but she scarcely breathed more freely. Her alarm would not have been of a more appalling character, had she awoke to find herself encircled in the horrible coils of a boa-constrictor.</p>
<p n="240">"The clergyman of the village was a justice of the peace; and before his worshipful reverence was I accordingly taken. He was an elderly man, very corpulent and very stern; and he frowned upon me in a ferocious manner when I was conducted into the library, where he intended to hear the case. Cousin George, who had only shaved one side of his face, and had a black bristly beard over the other, stepped forward and stated the entire case, which comprised the theft of his garments and the imposture practised upon his relative. In the latter business, however, the magistrate refused to interfere, and confined his attention to the abstraction of the trousers and boots. I, of course, set up the usual defence,—'Had never seen the gentleman before in my life—had bought the trousers and boots of a man that I met at a public house, and whose name I did not know; that I was an honest hard-working young fellow, out of employment; and had never been in trouble before.' The magistrate was, however, obstinate, and would not believe a word I uttered. He accordingly ordered me to be committed for trial at the sessions; and I was moved to an out-house, there to wait in the custody of the constable, until my mittimus was made out, and a cart was obtained to take me to the county gaol. Cousin George, satisfied with what he had done so far, threw a glance of triumph upon me as I was moved away from the magistrate's library.</p>
<p n="241">It is scarcely necessary to state that Mr. Graham exerted all his skill on behalf of the dying man.</p>
<p n="242"><said>"But is my character to suffer by the scandal of superannuated dowagers and the tattle of Club quid nuncs?"</said> demanded Vernon, rage imparting a terrible emphasis to his deep-toned voice.</p>
<p n="243">The little boy gave the larger piece of bread to his sister; and, having divested her of her rags, he made her as comfortable as he could on the filthy mattress, covering her over not only with her clothes but also with his own. He kissed her affectionately, but without making any noise with his lips, for fear that that should irritate his mother; and then lay down beside her.</p>
<p n="244">But when he entered the room where the spirit of his father had taken its leave of this world, his emotions almost overpowered him. He wept aloud; and even the old butler did not now endeavour to comfort him. He had returned, branded with shame, to a house where he had received an existence that was full of hope and honour:—he had come back to a dwelling in the rooms of which were hung the portraits of many great and good men, who were his ancestors, but amongst whom his own likeness could never take a place, for fear that some visitor to that mansion should write the words "Freed Convict" upon the frame.</p>
</sample>
<sample n="2"><p n="245"><said>“Why?”</said> repeats Mr. Snagsby, in his desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of his bald head, <said>“How should I know why? But you are a single person, sir, and may you long be spared to ask a married person such a question!”</said></p>
<p n="246">Such tears in her eyes, and such love in her face. I could not make my darling out. Should I go to Richard's by myself, I said? No, Ada thought I had better not go by myself. Would she go with me? Yes, Ada thought she had better go with me. Should we go now? Yes, let us go now. Well, I could not understand my darling, with the tears in her eyes and the love in her face!</p>
<p n="247">Afterwards, when Mr. Woodcourt came to reflect on what had passed, he was so very much impressed by the strength of Richard's anxiety on this point, that in telling me generally of his first visit to Symond's Inn, he particularly dwelt upon it. It revived a fear I had had before, that my dear girl's little property would be absorbed by Mr. Vholes, and that Richard's justification to himself would be sincerely this. It was just as I began to take care of Caddy, that the interview took place; and I now return to the time when Caddy had recovered, and the shade was still between me and my darling.</p>
<p n="248">When I was shut out with her in the hall, she said, holding up her hands, <said>“Oh if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come upstairs to Mr. Skimpole's room. He has been took, miss!”</said></p>
<p n="249"><said>“I am quite prepared.”</said></p>
<p n="250">Sir Leicester sits in my Lady's room—that room in which Mr. Tulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce—particularly complacent. My Lady—as on that day—sits before the fire with her screen in her hand. Sir Leicester is particularly complacent, because he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society. They apply so happily to the late case, that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my Lady's room expressly to read them aloud. <said>“The man who wrote this article,” </said>he observes by way of preface, nodding at the fire as if he were nodding down at the man from a Mount, <said>“has a well-balanced mind.”</said></p>
<p n="251">It was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing, and to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible not to know, that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which was tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any one, that I saw the tears in Ada's eyes while she echoed his laugh, and felt them in my own.</p>
<p n="252">So! Anger, and fear, and shame. All three contending. What power this woman has, to keep these raging passions down! Mr. Tulkinghorn's thoughts take such form as he looks at her, with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair's-breadth more contracted than usual, under her gaze.</p>
<p n="253"><said>“Good day again, sir, and I thank you kindly many times again.”</said></p>
<p n="254"><said>“But,”</said> said he, <said>“that is not to be remembered now.”</said></p>
<p n="255"><said>“Take a little care of Pa while I am gone, mama!”</said></p>
<p n="256"><said>“That was me,”</said> said Mr. Bucket.</p>
<p n="257"><said>“There's something in that,”</said> his wife assents; <said>“but so it is, Lignum.”</said></p>
<p n="258"><said>“No.”</said></p>
<p n="259"><said>“The same.”</said></p>
<p n="260"><said>“The country,”</said> says Mr. George, plying his knife and fork; <said>“why, I suppose you never clapped your eyes on the country, Phil?”</said></p>
<p n="261">They were so glad to see me when I got home, as they always were, that I could have sat down and cried for joy, if that had not been a method of making myself disagreeable. Everybody in the house, from the lowest to the highest, showed me such a bright face of welcome, and spoke so cheerily, and was so happy to do anything for me, that I suppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in the world.</p>
<p n="262"><said>“Esther!”</said></p>
<p n="263">At this period of the entertainment, Guster, who has never recovered her first failure, but has neglected no possible or impossible means of bringing the establishment and herself into contempt—among which may be briefly enumerated her unexpectedly performing clashing military music on Mr. Chadband's head with plates, and afterwards crowning that gentleman with muffins—at this period of the entertainment, Guster whispers Mr. Snagsby that he is wanted.</p>
<p n="264">Mr. Bucket looks very grave. Volumnia remarks of the deceased that he was the trustiest and dearest person!</p>
<p n="265">Mr. Tulkinghorn rubs his head with the key, while she entertains herself with a sarcastic laugh.</p>
<p n="266">He comes in. Holding the letter in her hand, which she has taken from the floor, she tries to collect her thoughts. In the eyes of Mr. Guppy she is the same Lady Dedlock, holding the same prepared, proud, chilling state.</p>
<p n="267"><said>“This is where he lives, sir,”</said> says the law-stationer.</p>
<p n="268"><said>“My kind soul of a darling,”</said> returns the trooper. <said>“Not a morsel of it.”</said></p>
<p n="269"><said>“Father, Miss Summerson; Miss Jellyby.”</said></p>
<p n="270">Six quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had passed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a looking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when, one November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.</p>
<p n="271">It was late before we separated: for when Ada was going at eleven o'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano, and rattled, hilariously, that the best of all ways, to lengthen our days, was to steal a few hours from Night, my dear! It was past twelve before he took his candle and his radiant face out of the room; and I think he might have kept us there, if he had seen fit, until daybreak. Ada and Richard were lingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs. Jellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, when Mr. Jarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.</p>
<p n="272"><said>“That is certainly what I endeavour to do, sir,”</said> returns Mr. Snagsby.</p>
<p n="273"><said>“No, no. Don't deceive yourself, my dear. Nobody's here. But I've got it!”</said></p>
<p n="274"><said>“The picture has never been engraved. Sir Leicester has always refused permission.”</said></p>
<p n="275">Mr. Squod tacks out, all on one side, to execute the word of command; and the trooper, having smoked his pipe, lays it by. Jo is brought in. He is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle's Tockahoopo Indians; he is not one of Mrs. Jellyby's lambs, being wholly unconnected with Borrioboola-Gha; he is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity; he is not a genuine foreign-grown savage; he is the ordinary home-made article. Dirty, ugly, disagreeable to all the senses, in body a common creature of the common streets, only in soul a heathen. Homely filth begrimes him, homely parasites devour him, homely sores are in him, homely rags are on him: native ignorance, the growth of English soil and climate, sinks his immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish. Stand forth, Jo, in uncompromising colors! From the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head, there is nothing interesting about thee.</p>
<p n="276"><said>“You mean about the man?”</said> says Jo, following. <said>“Him as wos dead?”</said></p>
<p n="277"><said>“O! I, Tony!”</said> says Mr. Guppy, soothing him. <said>“I have never lived there, and couldn't get a lodging there now; whereas you have got one.”</said></p>
<p n="278"><said>“Esther,”</said> he returned, <said>“it is indeed. I am just so near disgrace as that those who are put in authority over me (as the catechism goes) would far rather be without me than with me. And they are right. Apart from debts and duns, and all such drawbacks, I am not fit even for this employment. I have no care, no mind, no heart, no soul, but for one thing. Why, if this bubble hadn't broken now,” </said>he said, tearing the letter he had written into fragments, and moodily casting them away, by driblets, <said>“how could I have gone abroad? I must have been ordered abroad; but how could I have gone. How could I, with my experience of that thing, trust even Vholes unless I was at his back!”</said></p>
<p n="279"><said>“Why,”</said> acknowledged Richard, <said>“that may be True enough, my love. I rather feel it to be so. But I shall be able to give myself fair-play by and by. I shall come all right again, then, don't you be afraid.”</said></p>
<p n="280">His first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock's rooms, and look all over them for any trifling indication that may help him. The rooms are in darkness now; and to see Mr. Bucket with a wax-light in his hand, holding it above his head, and taking a sharp mental inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with himself, would be to see a sight—which nobody does see, as he is particular to lock himself in.</p>
<p n="281">Mrs. Bagnet is not at all an ill-looking woman. Rather large-boned, a little coarse in the grain, and freckled by the sun and wind which have tanned her hair upon the forehead; but healthy, wholesome, and bright-eyed. A strong, busy, active, honest-faced woman, of from forty-five to fifty. Clean, hardy, and so economically dressed (though substantially), that the only article of ornament of which she stands possessed appears to be her wedding ring; around which her finger has grown to be so large since it was put on, that it will never come off again until it shall mingle with Mrs. Bagnet's dust.</p>
<p n="282"><said>“With a second-hand wiolinceller,”</said> Mr. Bagnet put in, twitching his head angrily. <said>“Of a good tone. For a friend. That money was no object to.”</said></p>
<p n="283">The carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the rumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an impatient motion of my Lady's hand. My Lady alights so quickly, and walks away so quickly, that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous politeness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind. A space of a minute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her. She smiles, looks very handsome, takes his arm, lounges with him for a quarter of a mile, is very much bored, and resumes her seat in the carriage.</p>
<p n="284">Some time elapses, in the present instance, before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse; and even then he mixes it up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom, who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets. As thus:</p>
<p n="285">Yielding, therefore, the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper, Volumnia sits at a table a little removed, sympathetically sighing. Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow, and listens for the returning steps that he expects. In the ears of his old servant, looking as if she had stepped out of an old picture-frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world, the silence is fraught with echoes of her own words, “Who will tell him!”</p>
<p n="286">While the twain are faithful to their post, Mr. George strides through the streets with a massive kind of swagger and a grave-enough face. It is eight o'clock now, and the day is fast drawing in. He stops hard by Waterloo Bridge, and reads a playbill; decides to go to Astley's Theatre. Being there, is much delighted with the horses and the feats of strength; looks at the weapons with a critical eye; disapproves of the combats, as giving evidences of unskilful swordsmanship; but is touched home by the sentiments. In the last scene, when the Emperor of Tartary gets up into a cart and condescends to bless the united lovers, by hovering over them with the Union-Jack, his eye-lashes are moistened with emotion.</p>
<p n="287">Whether of questionable childishness or not, in any other matters, Mr. Skimpole had a child's enjoyment of change and bright weather. In no way wearied by his sallies on the road, he was in the drawing-room before any of us; and I heard him at the piano while I was yet looking after my housekeeping, singing refrains of barcaroles and drinking songs Italian and German by the score.</p>
<p n="288">In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply edified, Mr. Snagsby thinks it expedient on the whole to say Amen, which is well received.</p>
<p n="289">The lawyer sits down in his easy chair and stirs the fire. Mr. George hopes he will have the goodness to—</p>
<p n="290"><said>“It's me,”</said> returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his ear. <said>“Can't you wake him?”</said></p>
<p n="291"><said>“Chimney on fire!”</said></p>
<p n="292">The day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully effective, for it is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at his shop-door looking up at the clouds, sees a crow, who is out late, skim westward over the leaden slice of sky belonging to Cook's Court. The crow flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln's Inn Garden, into Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>
<p n="293">It is hopeless to ask for any information about General George, and would be, though Miss Flite had not already run up-stairs to put on her pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl, and to arm herself with her reticule of documents. But as she informs her physician, in her disjointed manner, on coming down in full array, that General George, whom she often calls upon, knows her dear Fitz-Jarndyce, and takes a great interest in all connected with her, Allan is induced to think that they may be in the right way. So he tells Jo, for his encouragement, that this walking about will soon be over now; and they repair to the General's. Fortunately it is not far.</p>
<p n="294">As he takes his seat with some difficulty, and with an air of pain, Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer, standing with one of his large hands on the library table.</p>
<p n="295"><said>“—Might do me good?”</said> said Richard, forcing a laugh as he finished the sentence. <said>“I shouldn't wonder! But it can only come in one way now—in one of two ways, I should rather say. Either the suit must be ended, Esther, or the suitor. But it shall be the suit, the suit, my dear girl!”</said></p>
<p n="296">He seemed so rapt all in a moment, and looked so curiously at us, that Richard said:</p>
<p n="297"><said>“I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in this illness and trouble, for I know I am not too old, nor too useless, to be a welcomer sight to him than anybody else in my place would be. But the step on the Ghost's Walk will walk my lady down, George; it has been many a day behind her, and now it will pass her, and go on.”</said></p>
<p n="298"><said>“Why, George!”</said> says Mrs. Bagnet, quietly threading her needle. <said>“How low you are!”</said></p>
<p n="299"><said>“What is the matter with you now?”</said> she asks him.</p>
<p n="300"><said>“It's the place you know,”</said> Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the fast increasing darkness, when there is silence again, <said>“where they wanted to put up Mrs. Rouncewell's son.”</said></p>
<p n="301"><said>“No,”</said> said she. <said>“I refer, my dear, to his social conduct. He is always paying trivial attentions to young ladies, and always has been, ever since he was eighteen. Now, my dear, he has never really cared for any one of them, and has never meant in doing this to do any harm, or to express anything but politeness and good nature. Still, it's not right, you know; is it?”</said></p>
<p n="302">Caddy untied the strings of her bonnet, took her bonnet off, and letting it dangle on the floor by the strings, and crying heartily, said, <said>“Ma, I am engaged.”</said></p>
<p n="303">Charley laid down her pen, the copy being finished; opened and shut her cramped little hand; looked gravely at the page, half in pride and half in doubt; and got up, and dropped me a curtsey.</p>
<p n="304"><said>“That's True,”</said> Mrs. Jellyby replied, <said>“that's True, my dear. I suppose we must make the best of it!”</said></p>
<p n="305"><said>“Ten minutes.”</said></p>
<p n="306"><said>“It showed a want of poetry in the man,”</said> Mr. Skimpole assented; but with perfect good-humour. <said>“It was coarse. There was an absence of the finer touches of humanity in it! My daughters have taken great offence,” </said>he explained to us, <said>“at an honest man —”</said></p>
<p n="307"><said>“She in all respects deserves it,”</said> says my Lady.</p>
<p n="308"><said>“Yes, I am indeed, sir, wery poor in gin'ral,”</said> replies Jo.</p>
<p n="309"><said>“I have heard it before.”</said></p>
<p n="310">If I could have made myself go to sleep, I would have done it directly; but, not being able to do that, I took out of my basket some ornamental work for our house (I mean Bleak House) that I was busy with at that time, and sat down to it with great determination. It was necessary to count all the stitches in that work, and I resolved to go on with it until I couldn't keep my eyes open, and then, to go to bed.</p>
<p n="311"><said>“No, father.”</said> The son had no watch. The father had a handsome gold one, which he pulled out, with an air that was an example to mankind.</p>
<p n="312"><said>“In these busy times, when so many great undertakings are in progress, people like myself have so many workmen in so many places, that we are always on the flight.”</said></p>
<p n="313"><said>“May I ask you a question?”</said> said I, when we had sat before the fire a little while.</p>
<p n="314">Allan looks at him inquiringly, repeating the name.</p>
<p n="315">I always wondered on these occasions whether he ever thought of Mrs. Skimpole and the children, and in what point of view they presented themselves to his cosmopolitan mind. So far as I could understand, they rarely presented themselves at all.</p>
<p n="316"><said>“Because,”</said> said I, <said>“Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have told each other so.”</said></p>
<p n="317">He reddened a little through his brown, and made me a trooper's bow. <said>“No offence, I hope, miss. I am one of the Roughs.”</said></p>
<p n="318">The old housekeeper weeping silently; Volumnia in the greatest agitation, with the freshest bloom on her cheeks; the trooper with his arms folded and his head a little bent, respectfully attentive.</p>
<p n="319"><said>“You come as a godsend,”</said> said Richard, <said>“for I have seen nobody here yet but Vholes. Woodcourt, there is one subject I should like to mention, for once and for all, in the beginning of our treaty. You can hardly make the best of me if I don't. You know, I dare say, that I have an attachment to my cousin Ada?”</said></p>
<p n="320">Here, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory staring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him, and he cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office. He keeps no staff; only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at elbows, who sits in a high Pew in the hall, and is rarely overburdened with business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. He wants no clerks. He is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped. His clients want him; he is all in all. Drafts that he requires to be drawn, are drawn by special-pleaders in the Temple on mysterious instructions; fair copies that he requires to be made, are made at the stationer's, expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in the Pew, knows scarcely more of the affairs of the Peerage, than any crossing-sweeper in Holborn.</p>
<p n="321"><said>“Not at all. I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house. I think it cannot be too prominently kept before the whole establishment. I wish my people to be impressed with the enormity of the crime, the determination to punish it, and the hopelessness of escape. At the same time, officer, if you in your better knowledge of the subject see any objection—”</said></p>
<p n="322">Sir Leicester begs to observe, that wholly alters the case. He might have been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in support of her view. He entirely agrees with my Lady. The young woman had better go.</p>
<p n="323">I saw him so often, in the course of the evening, which passed very pleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music—and he had small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music, for his face showed it—that I asked my Guardian, as we sat at the backgammon board, whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.</p>
<p n="324"><said>“True,”</said> said my guardian. <said>“I had forgotten that. But we would agree to make him rich enough to live, I suppose? Rich enough to work with tolerable peace of mind? Rich enough to have his own happy home, and his own household gods—and household goddess too, perhaps?”</said></p>
<p n="325"><said>“Yes, guardian. Innocently, but most surely. That secluded sister is my first remembrance.”</said></p>
<p n="326"><said>“I have long expected this, as you know. I neither wish to spare myself, nor to be spared. You can do nothing worse to me than you have done. Do what remains, now.”</said></p>
<p n="327"><said>“What kind of man. Do you mean to look at?”</said></p>
<p n="328">If Volumnia have a fault, it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent; seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker, is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace. Howbeit, impelled by innocence, she asks,</p>
<p n="329"><said>“Bless your heart for a True woman! Always curious, your delightful sex is!”</said> replies Mr. Bucket, with gallantry. <said>“I shall have the pleasure of giving you a call to-morrow or next day—not forgetting Mr. Smallweed and his proposal of two fifty.”</said></p>
<p n="330"><said>“Nothing, sir.”</said></p>
<p n="331">Plenty of dust comes in at Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows, and plenty more has generated among his furniture and papers. It lies thick everywhere. When a breeze from the country that has lost its way, takes fright, and makes a blind hurry to rush out again, it flings as much dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law—or Mr. Tulkinghorn, one of its trustiest representatives—may scatter, on occasion, in the eyes of the laity.</p>
<p n="332"><said>“You're right!”</said> returns Mr. Bucket, shaking hands with him quite affectionately,—<said>“on account of which, and at the same time to oblige a real good customer, you mean to go down with me, in confidence, to Tom-all-Alone's, and to keep the whole thing quiet ever afterwards and never mention it to any one. That's about your intentions, if I understand you?”</said></p>
<p n="333"><said>“Quite strong enough for that, miss!”</said> cried Charley. But Charley's face fell in the height of her delight, for she saw the secret in my face; and she came out of the great chair, and fell upon my bosom, and said <said>“O miss, it's my doing! It's my doing!” </said>and a great deal more, out of the fulness of her grateful heart.</p>
<p n="334">Ada blushed; and Mr. Boythorn, trotting forward on his comely gray horse, dismounted at his own door, and stood ready, with extended arm and uncovered head, to welcome us when we arrived.</p>
<p n="335"><said>“Ah, guardian, what have you done for me since that time!”</said></p>
<p n="336"><said>“Ah!”</said> says Mr. Bucket, <said>“a little spoilt? A little capricious? Lord! What can you anticipate when they're so handsome as that? And we like 'em all the better for it, don't we?”</said></p>
<p n="337"><said>“It is my reward,”</said> said Mr. Turveydrop, <said>“to hear you say so. In some respects, he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother. She was a devoted creature. But Wooman, lovely Wooman,” said Mr. Turveydrop, with very disagreeable gallantry, “what a sex you are!”</said></p>
<p n="338"><said>“Yes.”</said></p>
<p n="339"><said>“Then, you see, you live in a lonesome way, and in a lonesome room, with a black circumstance hanging over it,”</said> says Mr. Snagsby, looking in past the other's shoulder along the dark passage, and then falling back a step to look up at the house. <said>“I couldn't live in that room alone, as you do, sir. I should get so fidgetty and worried of an evening, sometimes, that I should be driven to come to the door, and stand here, sooner than sit there. But then it's very True that you didn't see, in your room, what I saw there. That makes a difference.”</said></p>
<p n="340"><said>“Guppy,”</said> says Mr. Jobling, <said>“I will not deny it. I was on the wrong side of the post. But I trusted to things coming round.”</said></p>
<p n="341">I could almost have believed in the attraction on which my poor little wandering friend had expatiated, when I saw again the darkened look of last night. Terrible to think, it had in it also, a shade of that unfortunate man who had died.</p>
<p n="342"><said>“So much the poorer you; so much the richer I! Look, mistress, this is the key of my wine-cellar. It is a large key, but the keys of prisons are larger. In this city, there are houses of correction (where the treadmills are, for women) the gates of which are very strong and heavy, and no doubt the keys too. I am afraid a lady of your spirit and activity would find it an inconvenience to have one of those keys turned upon her for any length of time. What do you think?”</said></p>
<p n="343"><said>“What enemy?”</said></p>
<p n="344">Service, however (with a few limited reservations: genteel but not profitable), they may not do, being of the Dedlock dignity. So they visit their richer cousins, and get into debt when they can, and live but shabbily when they can't, and find—the women no husbands, and the men no wives—and ride in borrowed carriages, and sit at feasts that are never of their own making, and so go through high life. The rich family sum has been divided by so many figures, and they are the something over that nobody knows what to do with.</p>
<p n="345"><said>“But it is a terrible misfortune, guardian.”</said></p>
<p n="346"><said>“I don't know where they are,”</said> says Phil; <said>“but I see 'em, guv'ner. They was flat. And miste.”</said></p>
<p n="347">Although I remember this conversation now, my head was in confusion at the time, and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me to understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me. With the same kind intention, manifestly, he often spoke to me of indifferent things, while his face was busy with the one object that we had in view. He still pursued this subject, as we turned in at the garden gate.</p>
<p n="348">We all conceived a prepossession in his favor; for there was a sterling quality in this laugh, and in his vigorous healthy voice, and in the roundness and fulness with which he uttered every word he spoke, and in the very fury of his superlatives, which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared to have it so confirmed by his appearance, when Mr. Jarndyce presented him. He was not only a very handsome old gentleman—upright and stalwart as he had been described to us—with a massive grey head, a fine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become corpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it no rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to assist; but he was such a True gentleman in his manner, so chivalrously polite, his face was lighted by a smile of so much sweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that he had nothing to hide, but showed himself exactly as he was—incapable (as Richard said) of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those blank great guns, because he carried no small arms whatever—that really I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat at dinner, whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led by Mr. Jarndyee into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up his head like a blood-hound, and gave out that tremendous Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p n="349">I was very busy indeed, all day, and wrote directions home to the servants, and wrote notes for my guardian, and dusted his books and papers, and jingled my housekeeping keys a good deal, one way and another. I was still busy between the lights, singing and working by the window, when who should come in but Caddy, whom I had no expectation of seeing!</p>
<p n="350"><said>“Well, you do surprise me! Yet he's like you, there's no denying. Lord, he's wonderfully like you! But about what you may call the brow, you know, there his father comes out!”</said> Mr. Bucket compares the faces with one eye shut up, while Mr. Bagnet smokes in stolid satisfaction.</p>
<p n="351">While thus looking out into the shade of Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, surveying the intolerable bricks and mortar, Mr. Guppy becomes conscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below, and turning itself up in the direction of his face. At the same time, a low whistle is wafted through the Inn, and a suppressed voice cries, <said>“Hip! Gup-py!”</said></p>
<p n="352">He who was so good and wise, to ask me whether he was right!</p>
<p n="353"><said>“I generally am near,”</said> returns Mr. Bucket, <said>“being so fond of children. A friend of mine has had nineteen of 'em, ma'am, all by one mother, and she's still as fresh and rosy as the morning. Not so much so as yourself, but, upon my soul, she comes near you! And what do you call these, my darling?” pursues Mr. Bucket, pinching Malta's cheek. </said><said>“These are peaches, these are. Bless your heart! And what do you think about father? Do you think father could recommend a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket's friend, my dear? My name's Bucket. Ain't that a funny name?”</said></p>
<p n="354"><said>“Well! Yes, of both of you,”</said> said Mr. Jarndyce, kindly. <said>“The time is not come for your standing pledged to one another. It is not right, and I must not recognise it. Come, come, my young cousins, begin afresh! Byegones shall be byegones, and a new page turned for you to write your lives in.”</said></p>
<p n="355">My housekeeping duties, though at first it caused me great anxiety to think that they were unperformed, were soon as far off as the oldest of the old duties at Greenleaf, or the summer afternoons when I went home from school with my portfolio under my arm, and my childish shadow at my side, to my godmother's house. I had never known before how short life really was, and into how small a space the mind could put it.</p>
<p n="356">All this passed in a whisper, a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning. In the little round of light produced for the purpose, Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked. The door was opened, after he had knocked twice; and he went in, leaving us standing in the street.</p>
<p n="357">Mr. Tulkinghorn, with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting itself through his self-possession, stands on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire, watching the disappearance of Mr. Smallweed, and acknowledging the trooper's parting salute with one slight nod.</p>
<p n="358"><said>“Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime?”</said> says Mr. Jobling.</p>
<p n="359"><said>“These are very long lies,”</said> Mademoiselle interposes. <said>“You prose great deal. Is it that you have almost all finished, or are you speaking always?”</said></p>
<p n="360"><said>“Perhaps,”</said> I began, <said>“you will wonder what has brought me here to interrupt you.”</said></p>
<p n="361"><said>“I wonder you remember those times, Esther,”</said> she returned with her old asperity. <said>“They are changed now. Well! I am glad to see you, and glad you are not too proud to know me.”</said> But, indeed she seemed disappointed that I was not.</p>
<p n="362">Leaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in the rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog knows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.</p>
<p n="363"><said>“Why?”</said> said Mr. Bucket. <said>“Because you'll come to that, if you don't look out. Why, at the very moment while I speak, I know what your mind's not wholly free from, respecting this young lady. But shall I tell you who this young lady is? Now, come, you're what I call an intellectual woman—with your soul too large for your body, if you come to that, and chafing it—and you know me, and you recollect where you saw me last, and what was talked of in that circle. Don't you? Yes! Very well. This young lady is that young lady.”</said></p>
<p n="364">Kenge and Carboy.</p>
<p n="365"><said>“There's not much to choose between your two states,”</said> says the visitor, in a key too low for the old man's dull hearing, as he looks from him to the old woman and back again. <said>“I say!” </said>in a louder voice.</p>
<p n="366"><said>“It's quite right. I gave him those directions,”</said> says my Lady. “Let the young man wait.”</p>
<p n="367">Every body starts. For a gun is fired close by.</p>
<p n="368">She was clumsy enough with her needle, poor girl, and pricked her fingers as much as she had been used to ink them. She could not help reddening a little, now and then: partly with the smart, and partly with vexation at being able to do no better: but she soon got over that, and began to improve rapidly. So, day after day, she, and my darling, and my little maid Charley, and a milliner out of the town, and I, sat hard at work, as pleasantly as possible.</p>
<p n="369">It was quite True, as it soon appeared. She lived so close by, that we had not time to have done humoring her for a few moments, before she was at home. Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old lady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of some courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and said, <said>“This is my lodging. Pray walk up!”</said></p>
<p n="370"><said>“In the same mind, sir.”</said></p>
<p n="371"><said>“OUR FATHER.”</said></p>
<p n="372"><said>“Why, just as you may suppose,”</said> said Mr. Jarndyce: his countenance suddenly falling. <said>“It is said that the children of the very poor are not brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole's children have tumbled up somehow or other.—The wind's getting round again, I am afraid. I feel it rather!”</said></p>
<p n="373">And could I help it, if with all this, and the coming to the little school, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving their hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady, whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited (who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring for nothing but calling out, <said>“Good bye, Esther. May you be very happy!”</said>—could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by myself, and said <said>“O, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!”</said> many times over!</p>
<p n="374">The mighty business is nearly over by this time, and Doodle will throw himself off the country in a few days more. Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing-room after dinner; a bright particular star, surrounded by clouds of cousins.</p>
<p n="375">We stopped in a high-street, where there was a coach-stand. My companion paid our two drivers, who were as completely covered with splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself; and giving them some brief direction where to take it, lifted me out of it, and into a hackney-coach he had chosen from the rest.</p>
<p n="376"><said>“I want five hundred pound.”</said></p>
<p n="377"><said>“Is it possible,”</said> whispered my Guardian, as we put a chair for the little creature, and got her to sit down with her load: the boy keeping close to her, holding to her apron, <said>“that this child works for the rest? Look at this! For God's sake look at this!”</said></p>
<p n="378">He took it in his, holding me lightly with his arm, and, looking down into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of manner—the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment—said, <said>“You have wrought changes in me, little woman, since the winter day in the stage coach. First and last you have done me a world of good, since that time.”</said></p>
<p n="379"><said>“Sure?”</said></p>
<p n="380">I thought Mrs. Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking over her papers, and drinking coffee, that night. It was twelve o'clock before we could obtain possession of the room; and the clearance it required then, was so discouraging, that Caddy, who was almost tired out, sat down in the middle of the dust, and cried. But she soon cheered up, and we did wonders with it before we went to bed.</p>
<p n="381">I stood at the window with Ada, pretending to look at the housetops, and the blackened stacks of chimnies, and the poor plants, and the birds in little cages belonging to the neighbours, when I found that Mrs. Blinder, from the shop below, had come in (perhaps it had taken her all this time to get up stairs) and was talking to my Guardian.</p>
<p n="382"><said>“When you passed a man upon the road, just yonder, you know,”</said> said Mr. Bucket.</p>
<p n="383">George makes his military bow. <said>“As far as that goes, Sir Leicester, I have done my duty under discipline, and it was the least I could do.”</said></p>
<p n="384"><said>“Mr. Woodcourt is so far away, now,”</said> said I, <said>“that I thought the time for such congratulation was past, Miss Flite.”</said></p>
<p n="385"><said>“I can't help my looks,”</said> says Mrs. Snagsby, <said>“and if I could I wouldn't.”</said></p>
<p n="386"><said>“Haven't I come to it, Mr. Bucket?”</said> cries Grandfather Smallweed. <said>“Isn't the gentleman concerned yet? Not with Captain Hawdon and his ever affectionate Honoria, and their child into the bargain? Come, then, I want to know where those letters are. That concerns me, if it don't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock. I will know where they are. I won't have 'em disappear so quietly. I handed 'em over to my friend and solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn; not to anybody else.”</said></p>
<p n="387"><said>“Yes,”</said> said I. <said>“That is my name.”</said></p>
<p n="388"><said>“Richard,”</said> I urged, <said>“it is not so hopeless as that?”</said></p>
<p n="389">I answered, most assuredly he did not.</p>
<p n="390"><said>“Of course you have not. Now, if I were not happily so much engaged, Miss Summerson,”</said> said Mrs. Jellyby, sweetly casting her eyes for a moment on me, and considering where to put the particular letter she had just opened, <said>“this would distress and disappoint me. But I have so much to think of, in connexion with Borrioboola Gha, and it is so necessary I should concentrate myself, that there is my remedy, you see.”</said></p>
<p n="391"><said>“I do assure you, sir,”</said> says Mr. George, <said>“not to say it offensively, that between you and Mr. Smallweed here, I really am being smothered fifty times over. I really am, sir. I am not a match for you gentlemen. Will you allow me to ask, why you want to see the captain's hand, in the case that I could find any specimen of it?”</said></p>
<p n="392"><said>“What do you want, sir?”</said></p>
<p n="393"><said>“Assuredly; mademoiselle, I am thankful for your politeness. Mademoiselle, I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a young lady who is good, accomplished, beautiful. You are good, accomplished, and beautiful as an angel. Ah, could I have the honor of being your domestic!”</said></p>
<p n="394"><said>“Is that Mr. Jarndyce's waggon?”</said> said Richard, calling to our postboy.</p>
<p n="395"><said>“Now, pet,”</said> said my guardian, <said>“if it would not be irksome to you to admit the harmless little creature one afternoon, before you save Boythorn's otherwise devoted house from demolition, I believe you would make her prouder and better pleased with herself than I—though my eminent name is Jarndyce—could do in a lifetime.”</said></p>
<p n="396"><said>“To accept this offer, my dear Esther,”</said> said he, sitting down beside me, and resuming our conversation,—<said>“once more, pray, pray forgive me; I am deeply grieved—to accept my dearest cousin's offer is, I need not say, impossible. Besides, I have letters and papers that I could show you, which would convince you it is all over here. I have done with the red coat, believe me. But it is some satisfaction, in the midst of my troubles and perplexities, to know that I am pressing Ada's interests in pressing my own. Vholes has his shoulder to the wheel, and he cannot help urging it on as much for her as for me, thank God!”</said></p>
<p n="397">Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning expedition. On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-house, where a number of men were flocking about the door. Among them, and prominent in some dispute, was the father of the little child. At a short distance, we passed the young man and the dog, in congenial company. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other young women, at the corner of the row of cottages; but she seemed ashamed, and turned away as we went by.</p>
<p n="398">The lamplighter is skipping up and down his ladder on Mr. Tulkinghorn's side of the Fields, when that high-priest of noble mysteries arrives at his own dull court-yard. He ascends the door-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall, when he encounters, on the top step, a bowing and propitiatory little man.</p>
<p n="399"><said>“Is the wind in the East to-day?”</said> I ventured to ask him.</p>
<p n="400">CHARLEY and I did not set off alone upon our expedition into Lincolnshire. My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in Mr. Boythorn's house; so he accompanied us, and we were two days upon the road. I found every breath of air, and every scent, and every flower and leaf and blade of grass, and every passing cloud, and everything in nature, more beautiful and wonderful to me than I had ever found it yet. This was my first gain from my illness. How little I had lost, when the wide world was so full of delight for me.</p>
<p n="401"><said>“Mr. Sangsby,”</said> says Jo, <said>“I went and giv a illness to the lady as wos and yit as warn't the t'other lady, and none of em never says nothink to me for having done it, on accounts of their being ser good and my having been s' unfortnet. The lady come herself and see me yesday, and she ses, </said><said>‘Ah Jo!’ </said><said>she ses. </said><said>‘We thought we'd lost you, Jo!’</said><said> she ses. And she sits down a smilin so quiet, and don't pass a word nor yit a look upon me for having done it, she don't, and I turns agin the wall, I doos, Mr. Sangsby. And Mr. Jarnders, I see him a forced to turn away his own self. And Mr. Woodcot, he come fur to giv me somethink fur to ease me, wot he's allus a doin on day and night, and wen he come a bendin over me and a speakin up so bold, I see his tears a fallin, Mr. Sangsby.”</said></p>
<p n="402">He looked so attentively at me, that I looked attentively at him, and felt sure I understood him.</p>
<p n="403"><said>“If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once, so that I may have no occasion to resume,”</said> I went on, seeing him about to speak, <said>“you will do me a kindness sir. I come to you as privately as possible, because you announced this impression of yours to me in a confidence which I have really wished to respect—and which I always have respected, as you remember. I have mentioned my illness. There really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you, is quite removed. Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred; and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me, to accede to it.”</said></p>
<p n="404"><said>“Even if she was, you know sir,”</said> Mr. Snagsby pleads, <said>“it wouldn't be a consolation to have some weapon or another in the form of a foreign dagger, planted in the family.”</said></p>
<p n="405">The pretty face is checked in its flush of pleasure, by the dark expression on the handsome face before it. It looks timidly for an explanation.</p>
<p n="406"><said>“A rat,”</said> says my Lady. <said>“And they have shot him.”</said></p>
<p n="407">Richard gave an anxious glance at Ada, but said nothing.</p>
<p n="408"><said>“I am convinced that he would not remain in either place, because he is possessed by an extraordinary terror of this person who ordered him to keep out of the way; in his ignorance, he believes this person to be everywhere, and cognisant of everything.”</said></p>
<p n="409"><said>“Out a washing,”</said> said the boy, beginning to walk up and down again, and taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead, by trying to gaze at us at the same time.</p>
<p n="410"><said>“At all events, Ada, Chancery will work none of its bad influence on us. We have happily been brought together, thanks to our good kinsman, and it can't divide us now!”</said></p>
<p n="411">George, with a look of assent and sympathy, makes another bow. The different times when they were both young men (the trooper much the younger of the two), and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold, arise before them both, and soften both.</p>
<p n="412">Mr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole himself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to Richard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which Richard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds, and the number of times he talked to me as if he had saved or realised that amount, would form a sum in simple addition.</p>
<p n="413"><said>“I think he might—I am afraid he would. I have known him do it,”</said> says Grandfather Smallweed, incautiously, <said>“twenty times.”</said></p>
<p n="414">My Lady's eyes look at him full. <said>“I saw a young lady of that name not long ago. This past autumn.”</said></p>
<p n="415"><said>“Who is that? What are you doing there?”</said></p>
<p n="416">Mr. Tulkinghorn (standing by the old portmanteau) inquires if he has been dead any time?</p>
<p n="417"><said>“That's the housekeeper's grandson, Mr. Rouncewell by name,”</said> said he; <said>“and he is in love with a pretty girl up at the House. Lady Dedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl, and is going to keep her about her own fair person—an honor which my young friend himself does not at all appreciate. However, he can't marry just yet, even if his Rosebud were willing; so he is fain to make the best of it. In the meanwhile, he comes here pretty often, for a day or two at a time, to—fish. Ha ha ha ha!”</said></p>
<p n="418"><said>“In the first place,”</said> returns Mr. George; but still looking at Judy, as if, she being so old and so like her grandfather, it is indifferent which of the two he addresses; <said>“you gentlemen took me in. You advertised that Mr. Hawdon (Captain Hawdon, if you hold to the saying, Once a captain always a captain) was to hear of something to his advantage.”</said></p>
<p n="419"><said>“Never, I hope, cousin Richard!”</said> said Ada, gently.</p>
<p n="420">They advance slowly, looking at all these things. The cat remains where they found her, still snarling at the something on the ground, before the fire and between the two chairs. What is it? Hold up the light?</p>
<p n="421"><said>“Read it, my dear Watt,”</said> says the housekeeper.</p>
<p n="422"><said>“He is very weak,”</said> said the trooper, in a low voice.</p>
<p n="423">Looking at the corner, I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby's head against the wall. It was consolatory to know that he had found such a resting-place for it.</p>
<p n="424">Yes, it appears.</p>
<p n="425">I broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, <said>“O, dear godmother, tell me, pray do tell me, did mama die on my birthday?”</said></p>
<p n="426"><said>“Certainly. It's the fashionable way; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses, and I don't care who knows it,”</said> says Mr. Jobling. <said>“They are great weaknesses—Damme, sir, they are great. Well!” </said>proceeds Mr. Jobling, after a defiant visit to his rum-and-water, <said>“what can a fellow do, I ask you, but enlist?”</said></p>
<p n="427">I said <said>“Not at all!”</said></p>
<p n="428">At first I tried to excuse myself, for the present, on the general ground of having occupations to attend to, which I must not neglect. But as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more particularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was inexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very differently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of view. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must be essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, myself, before I could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good intentions alone. For these reasons, I thought it best to be as useful as I could, and to render what kind services I could, to those immediately, about me; and to try to let that circle of duty gradually and naturally expand itself. All this I said, with anything but confidence; because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I, and had great experience, and was so very military in her manners.</p>
<p n="429">One thing has been much on her mind since their late interview in his turret-room at Chesney Wold. She is now decided, and prepared to throw it off.</p>
<p n="430"><said>“I must beg you, my Lady,”</said> he says while doing so, <said>“to remain a few moments; for this individual of whom I speak, arrived this evening shortly before dinner, and requested—in a very becoming note;” </said>Sir Leicester, with his habitual regard to truth, dwells upon it; <said>“I am bound to say, in a very becoming and well expressed note—the favor of a short interview with yourself and myself, on the subject of this young girl. As it appeared that he wished to depart to-night, I replied that we would see him before retiring.”</said></p>
<p n="431">A large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder, and startled us all.</p>
<p n="432"><said>“Ah my God, you are an unhappy idiot!”</said> cries Mademoiselle, with a toss of her head and a laugh.—<said>“Leave me to pass down stairs, great pig.”</said> With a stamp of her foot, and a menace.</p>
<p n="433"><said>“Would it be considered a liberty, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, if I was to ask you why?”</said></p>
<p n="434">But when it comes to four o'clock, and still the same blank, Volumnia's constancy begins to fail her, or rather it begins to strengthen; for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for the morrow, when much may be expected of her; that, in fact, howsoever anxious to remain upon the spot, it may be required of her, as an act of self-devotion, to desert the spot. So, when the trooper reappears with his <said>“Hadn't you better go to bed, miss?” </said>and when the maid protests, more sharply than before, <said>“You had a deal better go to bed, Miss Dedlock!” </said>she meekly rises and says, <said>“Do with me what you think best!”</said></p>
<p n="435"><said>“No. Bosh! Let her rest in peace, God bless her!”</said> says the trooper. <said>“What set me on about country boys, and runaways and good for nothings? You, to be sure! So you never clapped your eyes upon the country—marshes and dreams excepted. Eh?”</said></p>
<p n="436"><said>“Ha'n't you no relations now,”</said> asks Grandfather Smallweed, with a twinkle in his eyes, <said>“who would pay off this little principal, or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in the city to make you a further advance upon? Two good names would be sufficient for my friend in the city. Ha'n't you no such relations, Mr. George?”</said></p>
<p n="437">Volumnia's finishing the sentence restores her to favor. Sir Leicester, with a gracious inclination of his head, seems to say to himself, <said>“A sensible woman this, on the whole, though occasionally precipitate.”</said></p>
<p n="438">His face quite altered as he looked at me. <said>“My child, what questions are these! I never knew. No one but themselves ever did know, I believe. Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and proud women were! You have seen Lady Dedlock. If you had ever seen her sister, you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she.”</said></p>
<p n="439"><said>“Then he's as good as gold,”</said> said the little creature—O! in such a motherly, womanly way! <said>“And when Emma's tired, he puts her to bed. And when he's tired, he goes to bed himself. And when I come home and light the candle, and has a bit of supper, he sits up again and has it with me. Don't you, Tom?”</said></p>
<p n="440"><said>“Where did you say the wind was, Rick?”</said> asked Mr. Jarndyce.</p>
<p n="441">Every possible inquiry was made, and every place was searched. The brick-kilns were examined, the cottages were visited, the two women were particularly questioned, but they knew nothing of him, and nobody could doubt that their wonder was genuine. The weather had for some time been too wet, and the night itself had been too wet, to admit of any tracing by footsteps. Hedge and ditch, and wall, and rick and stack, were examined by our men for a long distance round, lest the boy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead; but nothing was seen to indicate that he had ever been near. From the time when he was left in the loft-room, he vanished.</p>
<p n="442"><said>“And you, Caddy,”</said> said I, <said>“you are always busy, I'll be bound?”</said></p>
<p n="443"><said>“Now, Miss Summerson,”</said> he said to me, as we walked quickly away. <said>“They've got her ladyship's watch among 'em. That's a positive fact.”</said></p>
<p n="444">Allan hopes Mr. George will forgive his intrusion the more readily on that account, and particularly that he will not lay aside his pipe, which, in his politeness, he has testified some intention of doing. <said>“You are very good, sir,” </said>returns the trooper. <said>“As I know, by experience, that it's not disagreeable to Miss Flite, and since it's equally agreeable to yourself—” </said><said>and finishes the sentence by putting it between his lips again. Allan proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo; unto which the trooper listens with a grave face.</said></p>
<p n="445">I told him I cared for no weather, and was warmly clothed.</p>
<p n="446">There are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new, but very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world, and to keep down all its realities. For whom everything must be languid and pretty. Who have found out the perpetual stoppage. Who are to rejoice at nothing, and be sorry for nothing. Who are not to be disturbed by ideas. On whom even the Fine Arts, attending in powder and walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array themselves in the milliners' and tailors' patterns of past generations, and be particularly careful not to be in earnest, or to receive any impress from the moving age.</p>
<p n="447">I said I would be ready at half-past six; and, after she was gone, stood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my trust. Ada found me thus; and had such a delightful confidence in me when I showed her the keys, and told her about them, that it would have been insensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged. I knew, to be sure, that it was the dear girl's kindness; but I liked to be so pleasantly cheated.</p>
<p n="448"><said>“The fact is, Mr. Smallweed,”</said> proceeds George, <said>“that I find myself in rather an unpleasant state of mind. It appears to me, sir, that your friend in the city has been playing tricks.”</said></p>
<p n="449"><said>“Guardian,”</said> said I, <said>“I am already certain. I can no more be changed in that conviction, than you can be changed towards me. I shall send Charley for the letter.”</said></p>
<p n="450"><said>“Why, George,”</said> returns Mrs. Bagnet, <said>“was always free with me, ma'am, and when he said at our house to my Woolwich, that of all the things my Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man, the comfortablest would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line into his mother's face, or turned a hair of her head gray, then I felt sure, from his way, that something fresh had brought his own mother into his mind. I had often known him say to me, in past times, that he had behaved bad to her.”</said></p>
<p n="451">As we ascended the hill, he looked about him with a sharp eye—the day was now breaking—and reminded me that I had come down it one night, as I had reason for remembering with my little servant and poor Jo: whom he called Toughey.</p>
<p n="452">The trooper puts his hand into his breast, and answers with a long breath, <said>“I must do it, sir.”</said></p>
<p n="453"><said>“Let us then, my brother, in a spirit of love,”</said> says Mr. Chadband, with a cunning eye, <said>“proceed untoe it. Rachael my wife, advance!”</said></p>
<p n="454">I asked him why? <said>“Why, my dear?” </said>said Mr. Bucket. <said>“Naturally there was no end to his tongue then. He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it, and a remnant over.”</said></p>
<p n="455"><said>“Certainly not. Talk in that cool way of a fellow's living there?”</said> cries Mr. Weevle, indignantly. <said>“Go and live there yourself.”</said></p>
<p n="456">As if there were any other in his life! As if his whole career and character were not being dyed one color!</p>
<p n="457"><said>“Ah!”</said> returns Mr. Guppy. <said>“See how the soot's falling. See here, on my arm! See again, on the table here! Confound the stuff, it won't blow off—smears, like black fat!”</said></p>
<p n="458"><said>“I thank you, Mr. Jarndyce,”</said> said Mr. Vholes, putting out his long black sleeve, to check the ringing of the bell, <said>“not any. I thank you, no, not a morsel. My digestion is much impaired, and I am but a poor knife and fork at any time. If I was to partake of solid food at this period of the day, I don't know what the consequences might be. Everything having been openly carried on, sir, I will now with your permission take my leave.”</said></p>
<p n="459"><said>“Dead!”</said></p>
<p n="460">When we were settled at home again, Ada and I had many conversations with my guardian, of which Richard was the theme. My dear girl was deeply grieved that he should do their kind cousin so much wrong; but she was so faithful to Richard, that she could not bear to blame him, even for that. My guardian was assured of it, and never coupled his name with a word of reproof. <said>“Rick is mistaken, my dear,” </said>he would say to her. <said>“Well, well! we have all been mistaken over and over again. We must trust to you and time to set him right.”</said></p>
<p n="461">Miss Flite looked to Charley for advice in this important crisis, who said, <said>“If you please, ma'am, you had better tell then,” </said>and therein gratified Miss Flite beyond measure.</p>
<p n="462"><said>“It is not likely to occur again,”</said> said I, smiling. <said>“Caddy will be married but once, probably.”</said></p>
<p n="463">Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears, rosy from the invigorating pail, and sits down to her work, Mr. Bagnet growls <said>“Old girl!” </said>and winks monitions to her to find out what's the matter.</p>
<p n="464"><said>“My dearest friend!”</said></p>
<p n="465"><said>“I know your welfare to be the dearest wish of her heart,”</said> said I. <said>“And O, my dear Richard, Ada's is a noble heart!”</said></p>
<p n="466">That was quite another thing, I said. We must all agree in that.</p>
<p n="467"><said>“What do you mean, George? You did help him. You took him under your roof.”</said></p>
<p n="468">I laughed; and Caddy laughed and blushed, and went on.</p>
<p n="469">And thus poor Charley sickened, and grew worse, and fell into heavy danger of death, and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night. So patient she was, so uncomplaining, and inspired by such a gentle fortitude, that very often as I sat by Charley, holding her head in my arms—repose would come to her, so, when it would come to her in no other attitude—I silently prayed to our Father in heaven that I might not forget the lesson which this little sister taught me.</p>
</sample>
<sample n="3"><p n="470"><said>"I am not at all sure that I should be befriending your son by smoothing his way to the future possession of Featherstone's property. I cannot regard wealth as a blessing to those who use it simply as a harvest for this world. You do not like to hear these things, Vincy, but on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you that I have no motive for furthering such a disposition of property as that which you refer to. I do not shrink from saying that it will not tend to your son's eternal welfare or to the glory of God. Why then should you expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?"</said></p>
<p n="471"><said>"Not high-flown enough?"</said></p>
<p n="472"><said>"Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy when I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have patience. It will perhaps be a long while."</said></p>
<p n="473">The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not yet discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even for her self-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the disappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a nightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while his family should suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her vexation had fermented the more actively because of its total repression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will sometimes find scapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic decision, <said>"You made a great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you."</said></p>
<p n="474">The cousin was so close now, that, when he lifted his hat, Dorothea could see a pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate irregular nose with a little ripple in it, and hair falling backward; but there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent, threatening aspect than belonged to the type of the grandmother's miniature. Young Ladislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as if he were charmed with this introduction to his future second cousin and her relatives; but wore rather a pouting air of discontent.</p>
<p n="475"><said>"It strengthens the disease,"</said> said the Rector's wife, much too well-born not to be an amateur in medicine. <said>"Everything depends on the constitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some bile—that's my view of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the mill."</said></p>
<p n="476"><said>"And was that business—or was it not—a thoroughly dishonourable one—nay, one that, if its nature had been made public, might have ranked those concerned in it with thieves and convicts?"</said></p>
<p n="477">Rosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she said, <said>"Very well, I will stay at home."</said></p>
<p n="478">Lydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service his practice did him in counteracting his personal cares. He had no longer free energy enough for spontaneous research and speculative thinking, but by the bedside of patients, the direct external calls on his judgment and sympathies brought the added impulse needed to draw him out of himself. It was not simply that beneficent harness of routine which enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy men to live calmly—it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh application of thought, and on the consideration of another's need and trial. Many of us looking back through life would say that the kindest man we have ever known has been a medical man, or perhaps that surgeon whose fine tact, directed by deeply informed perception, has come to us in our need with a more sublime beneficence than that of miracle-workers. Some of that twice-blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in his work at the Hospital or in private houses, serving better than any opiate to quiet and sustain him under his anxieties and his sense of mental degeneracy.</p>
<p n="479"><said>"Yes, father: the school at York. I have determined to take it. It is quite the best. Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for teaching the smallest strummers at the piano."</said></p>
<p n="480"><said>"Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,"</said> said Celia.</p>
<p n="481"><said>"What does it matter whether I forgive you?"</said> said Mary, passionately. <said>"Would that make it any better for my mother to lose the money she has been earning by lessons for four years, that she might send Alfred to Mr. Hanmer's? Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?"</said></p>
<p n="482"><said>"I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair parish priest without being much of a divine?"</said></p>
<p n="483"><said>"I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty. Sir James is a good, honourable man,"</said> said Dorothea, warmly.</p>
<p n="484"><said>"I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age,"</said> said Dorothea, with grave decision. <said>"I should wish to have a husband who was above me in judgment and in all knowledge."</said></p>
<p n="485">While Fred was speaking, he had taken out the notes and laid them on the desk before Mr. Garth. He had burst forth at once with the plain fact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources. Mrs. Garth was mutely astonished, and looked at her husband for an explanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said—</p>
<p n="486">Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of outdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of view, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid, and whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging kind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence from letting out the full force of his mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey's friendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of Lydgate's reply. But let the wise be warned against too great readiness at explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the sum for reckoners sure to go wrong.</p>
<p n="487"><said>"I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. I was sure that you would not think well of me if I did so,"</said> said Will. Why should he mind saying anything of that sort to her now? She knew that he had avowed his love for her. <said>"I felt that"</said>—he broke off, nevertheless.</p>
<p n="488"><said>"You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I ought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond to your pattern of a lady."</said> Dorothea looked straight before her, and spoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy, in amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.</p>
<p n="489"><said>"Sit down, sit down. Mrs. Waule, you'd better go."</said></p>
<p n="490"><said>"Why, mother,"</said> said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh, <said>"you know very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North. He never heard of Bulstrode before he came here."</said></p>
<p n="491">The lad's ankle was strained, and he was in much pain from it, but he was no further hurt, and Fred placed him on the horse that he might ride to Yoddrell's and be taken care of there.</p>
<p n="492"><said>"I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me."</said></p>
<p n="493"><said>"Not if she marries again before the end of it,"</said> said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had some pleasure in startling her good friend the Dowager. Sir James was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with Celia's Maltese dog.</p>
<p n="494"><said>"Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take a decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be suffering. Six weeks!—I am sure they would be ample."</said></p>
<p n="495"><said>"Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with me: I like to know the truth. Has anything happened to Mr. Bulstrode?"</said></p>
<p n="496"><said>"You said, according to him, that he would be one of those ridiculous clergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous. Really, that was so cutting that I felt a little cut myself."</said></p>
<p n="497"><said>"I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his wife, Mr. Farebrother: but I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman. What you say is most generous and kind; I don't mean for a moment to correct your judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of looking at things,"</said> said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness in her answer which only made its modesty more charming.</p>
<p n="498">So they only said <said>"Good-by,"</said> and Will quitted the house, striking across the fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr. Casaubon's carriage, which, however, did not appear at the gate until four o'clock. That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too early to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his person for dinner, and too late to undress his mind of the day's frivolous ceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the serious business of study. On such occasions he usually threw into an easy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London papers to him, closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined that relief, observing that he had already had too many public details urged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea asked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which never forsook him even when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—</p>
<p n="499"><said>"And there is one thing even now that you can do,"</said> said Dorothea, rising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring impulse. <said>"Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of that subject—I mean about Mr. Casaubon's writings—I mean in that kind of way. It was I who led to it. It was my fault. But promise me."</said></p>
<p n="500">A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of Lydgate's skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided, depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence. Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare, like old Featherstone's, had been at once inclined to try him; also, many who did not like paying their doctor's bills, thought agreeably of opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint if the children's temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to employ Lydgate held it likely that he was clever. Some considered that he might do more than others "where there was liver;"—at least there would be no harm in getting a few bottles of "stuff" from him, since if these proved useless it would still be possible to return to the Purifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the yellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good Middlemarch families were of course not going to change their doctor without reason shown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged to accept a new man merely in the character of his successor, objecting that he was "not likely to be equal to Peacock."</p>
<p n="501"><said>"Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?"</said> said Solomon, in a soft tone of humility, in which he had a sense of luxurious cunning, he being a rich man and not in need of it.</p>
<p n="502"><said>"Fred is not come yet?"</said></p>
<p n="503">Poor Mrs. Bulstrode, meanwhile, had been no further shaken by the oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret uneasiness which had always been present in her since the last visit of Raffles to The Shrubs. That the hateful man had come ill to Stone Court, and that her husband had chosen to remain there and watch over him, she allowed to be explained by the fact that Raffles had been employed and aided in earlier-days, and that this made a tie of benevolence towards him in his degraded helplessness; and she had been since then innocently cheered by her husband's more hopeful speech about his own health and ability to continue his attention to business. The calm was disturbed when Lydgate had brought him home ill from the meeting, and in spite of comforting assurances during the next few days, she cried in private from the conviction that her husband was not suffering from bodily illness merely, but from something that afflicted his mind. He would not allow her to read to him, and scarcely to sit with him, alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements; yet she suspected that in shutting himself up in his private room he wanted to be busy with his papers. Something, she felt sure, had happened. Perhaps it was some great loss of money; and she was kept in the dark. Not daring to question her husband, she said to Lydgate, on the fifth day after the meeting, when she had not left home except to go to church—</p>
<p n="504"><said>"I must give you the ninety-two pounds that I have put by for Alfred's premium,"</said> said Mrs. Garth, gravely and decisively, though a nice ear might have discerned a slight tremor in some of the words. <said>"And I have no doubt that Mary has twenty pounds saved from her salary by this time. She will advance it."</said></p>
<p n="505"><said>"When a man is not loved, it is no use for him to say that he could be a better fellow—could do anything—I mean, if he were sure of being loved in return."</said></p>
<p n="506"><said>"But would he? His father and mother wanted him to be a fine gentleman, and I think he has the same sort of feeling himself. They all think us beneath them. And if the proposal came from you, I am sure Mrs. Vincy would say that we wanted Fred for Mary."</said></p>
<p n="507">They moved apart, looking at each other.</p>
<p n="508"><said>"Sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar."</said></p>
<p n="509">It would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken up his hat and gone away; but he had felt no impulse to do this; on the contrary, he had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond with his anger. It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality she had drawn down on him without venting his fury as it would be to a panther to bear the javelin-wound without springing and biting. And yet—how could he tell a woman that he was ready to curse her? He was fuming under a repressive law which he was forced to acknowledge: he was dangerously poised, and Rosamond's voice now brought the decisive vibration. In flute-like tones of sarcasm she said—</p>
<p n="510">He was fortunate enough when he got on to the highroad to be overtaken by the stage-coach, which carried him to Brassing; and there he took the new-made railway, observing to his fellow-passengers that he considered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for Huskisson. Mr. Raffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at an academy, and being able, if he chose, to pass well everywhere; indeed, there was not one of his fellow-men whom he did not feel himself in a position to ridicule and torment, confident of the entertainment which he thus gave to all the rest of the company.</p>
<p n="511"><said>"You can't keep up with Fred and me,"</said> said Ben.</p>
<p n="512"><said>"What is your religion?"</said> said Dorothea. <said>"I mean—not what you know about religion, but the belief that helps you most?"</said></p>
<p n="513">Fred's mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his ready hopefulness could not immediately quell. He saw no way of eluding Featherstone's stupid demand without incurring consequences which he liked less even than the task of fulfilling it. His father was already out of humor with him, and would be still more so if he were the occasion of any additional coolness between his own family and the Bulstrodes. Then, he himself hated having to go and speak to his uncle Bulstrode, and perhaps after drinking wine he had said many foolish things about Featherstone's property, and these had been magnified by report. Fred felt that he made a wretched figure as a fellow who bragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone, and went to beg for certificates at his bidding. But—those expectations! He really had them, and he saw no agreeable alternative if he gave them up; besides, he had lately made a debt which galled him extremely, and old Featherstone had almost bargained to pay it off. The whole affair was miserably small: his debts were small, even his expectations were not anything so very magnificent. Fred had known men to whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of his scrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic bitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular, while such men as Mainwaring and Vyan—certainly life was a poor business, when a spirited young fellow, with a good appetite for the best of everything, had so poor an outlook.</p>
<p n="514"><said>"Then I will stay,"</said> said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising and going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased.</p>
<p n="515"><said>"And a most deadly blow it will be to Harriet,"</said> said Mrs. Plymdale. <said>"If ever a woman was crushed, she will be. I pity her from my heart. And with all her faults, few women are better. From a girl she had the neatest ways, and was always good-hearted, and as open as the day. You might look into her drawers when you would—always the same. And so she has brought up Kate and Ellen. You may think how hard it will be for her to go among foreigners."</said></p>
<p n="516"><said>"But I mean, before that. Something had vexed you before you came in, you looked cross. And that made you begin to dispute with Mr. Ladislaw. You hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius."</said></p>
<p n="517">Mary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old man, propped up on his pillows and bed-rest, with his bony hand holding out the key, and the money lying on the quilt before him. She never forgot that vision of a man wanting to do as he liked at the last. But the way in which he had put the offer of the money urged her to speak with harder resolution than ever.</p>
<p n="518">She tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of her own relief, lest she should fail to win some sign that Rosamond's affection was yearning back towards her husband.</p>
<p n="519"><said>"You have not made my life pleasant to me of late"</said><said>—"the hardships which our marriage has brought on me"</said>—these words were stinging his imagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream. If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?</p>
<p n="520"><said>"Really, I never thought about it,"</said> said Will, sulkily.</p>
<p n="521"><said>"Please don't be angry with Dodo; she does not see things. She thought so much about the cottages, and she was rude to Sir James sometimes; but he is so kind, he never noticed it."</said></p>
<p n="522">Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir James told her of it. After Dorothea's account, he no longer considered the illness a fit, but still something <said>"of that nature."</said></p>
<p n="523"><said>"Well, but how—we only want eighteen—here, put the rest back, child,—but how did you know about it?"</said> said Caleb, who, in his unconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly concerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary's affections.</p>
<p n="524"><said>"More than I am likely to get anywhere,"</said> said Lydgate, with rather a grating sarcasm in his tone. It angered him to perceive that Rosamond's mind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible efforts.</p>
<p n="525">It was not in Mr. Bulstrode's nature to comply directly in consequence of uncomfortable suggestions. Before changing his course, he always needed to shape his motives and bring them into accordance with his habitual standard. He said, at last—</p>
<p n="526"><said>"Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?"</said> said Celia, with her ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the smallest occasions.</p>
<p n="527"><said>"Yes, yes. The long and short of it is, somebody has told old Featherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been borrowing or trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land. Of course you never said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will insist on it that Fred should bring him a denial in your handwriting; that is, just a bit of a note saying you don't believe a word of such stuff, either of his having borrowed or tried to borrow in such a fool's way. I suppose you can have no objection to do that."</said></p>
<p n="528"><said>"Oh yes,"</said> said Dorothea, cordially. <said>It will come; and I shall remember how well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be friends when I first saw you—because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon."</said> There was a certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and Will was conscious that his own were obeying a law of nature and filling too. The allusion to Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that moment could have spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of her noble unsuspicious inexperience.</p>
<p n="529"><said>"Poor fellow!"</said> said Rosamond, prettily. <said>"You will see Fred so changed," </said>she added, turning to the other suitor; <said>"we have looked to Mr. Lydgate as our guardian angel during this illness."</said></p>
<p n="530">That night after twelve o'clock Mary Garth relieved the watch in Mr. Featherstone's room, and sat there alone through the small hours. She often chose this task, in which she found some pleasure, notwithstanding the old man's testiness whenever he demanded her attentions. There were intervals in which she could sit perfectly still, enjoying the outer stillness and the subdued light. The red fire with its gently audible movement seemed like a solemn existence calmly independent of the petty passions, the imbecile desires, the straining after worthless uncertainties, which were daily moving her contempt. Mary was fond of her own thoughts, and could amuse herself well sitting in twilight with her hands in her lap; for, having early had strong reason to believe that things were not likely to be arranged for her peculiar satisfaction, she wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance at that fact. And she had already come to take life very much as a comedy in which she had a proud, nay, a generous resolution not to act the mean or treacherous part. Mary might have become cynical if she had not had parents whom she honoured, and a well of affectionate gratitude within her, which was all the fuller because she had learned to make no unreasonable claims.</p>
<p n="531">She did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she said, with some earnestness, <said>"Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his dislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that is admirable."</said></p>
<p n="532"><said>"Brother Peter,"</said> he said, in a wheedling yet gravely official tone, <said>"It's nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three Crofts and the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I've got on my mind—"</said></p>
<p n="533">Mr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was listening.</p>
<p n="534"><said>"No, thank you, Mrs. Waule,"</said> said Mary Garth. <said>"I dislike hearing scandal too much to wish to repeat it."</said></p>
<p n="535"><said>"So I am,"</said> said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of double soul which belongs to dreamers who answer questions.</p>
<p n="536"><said>"It was himself he blamed for not speaking,"</said> said Dorothea. <said>"What he said of you was, that he could not be happy in doing anything which made you unhappy—that his marriage was of course a bond which must affect his choice about everything; and for that reason he refused my proposal that he should keep his position at the Hospital, because that would bind him to stay in Middlemarch, and he would not undertake to do anything which would be painful to you. He could say that to me, because he knows that I had much trial in my marriage, from my husband's illness, which hindered his plans and saddened him; and he knows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting another who is tied to us."</said></p>
<p n="537"><said>"Why, my dear, doctors must have opinions,"</said> said Mrs. Vincy. <said>"What are they there for else?"</said></p>
<p n="538">Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with Lydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this variety of interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question, diverse minds were enabled to form the same judgment concerning it.</p>
<p n="539"><said>"Caleb likes taking trouble: he is one of those men who always do more than any one would have thought of asking them to do,"</said> answered Mrs. Garth. She was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she chose—always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with salutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved, she did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.</p>
<p n="540"><said>"I am told that your mother's name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she ran away from her friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was at one time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these statements?"</said></p>
<p n="541">It was a time, according to a noticeable article in the "Pioneer," when the crying needs of the country might well counteract a reluctance to public action on the part of men whose minds had from long experience acquired breadth as well as concentration, decision of judgment as well as tolerance, dispassionateness as well as energy—in fact, all those qualities which in the melancholy experience of mankind have been the least disposed to share lodgings.</p>
<p n="542">And some oddities of Will's, more or less poetical, appeared to support Mr. Keck, the editor of the "Trumpet," in asserting that Ladislaw, if the truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained, which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his speech when he got on to a platform—as he did whenever he had an opportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid Englishmen generally. It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a fellow, with light curls round his head, get up and speechify by the hour against institutions <said>"which had existed when he was in his cradle."</said> And in a leading article of the "Trumpet," Keck characterized Ladislaw's speech at a Reform meeting as <said>"the violence of an energumen—a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks the daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge which was of the cheapest and most recent description."</said></p>
<p n="543"><said>"Of course I submitted to him, because it was my duty; it was my feeling for him,"</said> said Dorothea, looking through the prism of her tears.</p>
<p n="544">The season was mild enough to encourage the project of extending the wedding journey as far as Rome, and Mr. Casaubon was anxious for this because he wished to inspect some manuscripts in the Vatican.</p>
<p n="545">Celia thought privately, <said>"Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I believe she would not accept him." </said>Celia felt that this was a pity. She had never been deceived as to the object of the baronet's interest. Sometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a husband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in the depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too religious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even eating.</p>
<p n="546">Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and sneering in Raffles' manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had determined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words upon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the difficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be permanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he should wish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be regarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might have sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode's subversion as an instrument of good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a chastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very different from the hours in which his struggle had been securely private, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were pardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even when committed—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his desire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the divine scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling and a rock of offence? For who would understand the work within him? Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him, confound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of obloquy?</p>
<p n="547"><said>"I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to him,"</said> said Dr. Minchin, looking towards Toller, <said>"for he has sent you the cream of Peacock's patients."</said></p>
<p n="548"><said>"That you were,"</said> said the wife, nodding and smiling. <said>"But I should not have gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should you keep such things from me? It is just so with your buttons: you let them burst off without telling me, and go out with your wristband hanging. If I had only known I might have been ready with some better plan."</said></p>
<p n="549">In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day's work, was seated in silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while Mrs. Garth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was whispering a dialogue with her doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the orchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the tufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was fond of his parishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to Lydgate. He used to the full the clergyman's privilege of disregarding the Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his mother that Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still, you see, he spent his evenings at the Vincys', where the matron, though less of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In those days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect. But the Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from him was no surprise to that family. Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he was shaking hands, by saying, <said>"I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have something to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The fact is, poor fellow,"</said> he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with his bright glance at the three who were listening to him, <said>"he has taken me into his confidence."</said></p>
<p n="550">Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched the corners of his mouth in despair. Rosamond, seeing that he was not looking at her, rose and set his cup of coffee before him; but he took no notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument, occasionally moving in his seat, resting one arm on the table, and rubbing his hand against his hair. There was a conflux of emotions and thoughts in him that would not let him either give thorough way to his anger or persevere with simple rigidity of resolve. Rosamond took advantage of his silence.</p>
<p n="551">He did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with the three ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on some subject which was dropped when he entered, and Mary was copying the labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers, in a minute handwriting which she was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in the village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred's peculiar relation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that they should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that he should have to go away without saying a word to her in private. He told her first of Christy's arrival and then of his own engagement with her father; and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news touched her keenly. She said hurriedly, <said>I am so glad,"</said> and then bent over her writing to hinder any one from noticing her face. But here was a subject which Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.</p>
<p n="552"><said>"Bless you both, my dears, and don't quarrel,"</said> said Mrs. Vincy, with motherly cordiality. <said>"Come, Fred, tell us all about the new doctor. How is your uncle pleased with him?"</said></p>
<p n="553"><said>"Will you let me go and fetch him?"</said> said Will Ladislaw, coming forward. He had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered. She coloured with surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable pleasure, saying—</p>
<p n="554"><said>"It's not a thing I would put in my drawing-room,"</said> said Mrs. Mawmsey, audibly, for the warning of the rash husband. <said>"I wonder at Mrs. Larcher. Every blessed child's head that fell against it would be cut in two. The edge is like a knife."</said></p>
<p n="555">Dorothea walked across the street with her most elastic step and was quickly in her carriage again.</p>
<p n="556"><said>"Being among a lot of nincompoop girls,"</said> said Alfred.</p>
<p n="557">And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge. Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to "Berghems;" but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins; he was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe under his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his recommendation.</p>
<p n="558">It was just after the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill: that explains how Mr. Cadwallader came to be walking on the slope of the lawn near the great conservatory at Freshitt Hall, holding the "Times" in his hands behind him, while he talked with a trout-fisher's dispassionateness about the prospects of the country to Sir James Chettam. Mrs. Cadwallader, the Dowager Lady Chettam, and Celia were sometimes seated on garden-chairs, sometimes walking to meet little Arthur, who was being drawn in his chariot, and, as became the infantine Bouddha, was sheltered by his sacred umbrella with handsome silken fringe.</p>
<p n="559"><said>"To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,"</said> said Will. <said>"But I am a rebel: I don't feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don't like."</said></p>
<p n="560">But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow circumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante and Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of things, and in later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and more conversation. Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was limited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He found out at last that he wanted to take a particular sketch at Lowick; and one morning when Mr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick road on his way to the county town, Will asked to be set down with his sketch-book and camp-stool at Lowick, and without announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to sketch in a position where he must see Dorothea if she came out to walk—and he knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.</p>
<p n="561"><said>"Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a connoissure, I think. It is some pleasure,"</said> the auctioneer went on with a rising fervor, <said>"to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and gentlemen—a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on a level with his judgment. It is a painting of the Italian school—by the celebrated Guydo, the greatest painter in the world, the chief of the Old Masters, as they are called—I take it, because they were up to a thing or two beyond most of us—in possession of secrets now lost to the bulk of mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have seen a great many pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this mark—some of them are darker than you might like and not family subjects. But here is a Guydo—the frame alone is worth pounds—which any lady might be proud to hang up—a suitable thing for what we call a refectory in a charitable institution, if any gentleman of the Corporation wished to show his munificence. Turn it a little, sir? yes. Joseph, turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw—Mr. Ladislaw, having been abroad, understands the merit of these things, you observe."</said></p>
<p n="562"><said>"Do you suppose she would like me better for sacrificing you? She is not a woman to be flattered because I made myself despicable—to believe that I must be True to her because I was a dastard to you."</said></p>
<p n="563">But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not long remain passive where action had been assigned to her; she knew the purport of her husband's will made at the time of their marriage, and her mind, as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position, was silently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick Manor with the patronage of the living attached to it.</p>
<p n="564"><said>"I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben,"</said> said Mrs. Garth, accustomed to these obstructive arguments from her male offspring. Having finished her pies, she moved towards the clothes-horse, and said, <said>"Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday, about Cincinnatus."</said></p>
<p n="565"><said>"His first wife was a poor match for him, though,"</said> said Mrs. Waule. <said>"She brought him nothing: and this young woman is only her niece,—and very proud. And my brother has always paid her wage."</said></p>
<p n="566"><said>"That's very fine, my dear fellow. But your cure must begin somewhere, and put it that a thousand things which debase a population can never be reformed without this particular reform to begin with. Look what Stanley said the other day—that the House had been tinkering long enough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that voter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been sold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and conscience in public agents—fiddlestick! The only conscience we can trust to is the massive sense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work is the wisdom of balancing claims. That's my text—which side is injured? I support the man who supports their claims; not the virtuous upholder of the wrong."</said></p>
<p n="567"><said>"You mean of family ties?"</said> said Lydgate, conceiving that these might press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother.</p>
<p n="568"><said>"Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have never had time to give myself much to natural history. I was early bitten with an interest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my profession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea to swim in there."</said></p>
<p n="569">She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage. And if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his lair with his talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been an unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet. But he was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he was a benefactor with collective society at his back, and he was at that moment entering the room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor, while Dorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm and regret, and Will was looking animated with his admiring speculation about her feelings.</p>
<p n="570"><said>"Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr. Lydgate is both."</said></p>
<p n="571"><said>"It's no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw: they only pick the more holes in his coat in the 'Trumpet.'"</said></p>
<p n="572"><said>"Are we to go without spoons and forks then?"</said> said Rosamond, whose very lips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her utterance. She was determined to make no further resistance or suggestions.</p>
<p n="573"><said>"I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet. I spoke as a mother."</said></p>
<p n="574"><said>"I cannot see why brothers are to make themselves disagreeable, any more than sisters."</said></p>
    <p n="575"><said>"Let us see,"</said> said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and handing it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. <said>"Copy me a line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end."</said></p>
<p n="576">Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the "Keepsake" towards him and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin, as if in wonderment at human folly.</p>
<p n="577"><said>"Do you know, I envy you that,"</said> Sir James said, as they continued walking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.</p>
<p n="578"><said>"Be just, Chettam,"</said> said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who objected to all this unnecessary discomfort. <said>"Mrs. Casaubon may be acting imprudently: she is giving up a fortune for the sake of a man, and we men have so poor an opinion of each other that we can hardly call a woman wise who does that. But I think you should not condemn it as a wrong action, in the strict sense of the word."</said></p>
<p n="579"><said>"She is very quiet—I have hardly noticed her."</said></p>
<p n="580"><said>"Somebody was saying,"</said> said the Rector, laughingly, <said>"that East Retford was nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery."</said></p>
<p n="581">Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy's mind insisted with remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially on what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That there might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but the case was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration: he was convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever, and that he had taken just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed immediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and precautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs. Vincy's terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words as came most easily. She thought it "very ill usage on the part of Mr. Wrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to Mr. Peacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr. Wrench should neglect her children more than others, she could not for the life of her understand. He had not neglected Mrs. Larcher's when they had the measles, nor indeed would Mrs. Vincy have wished that he should. And if anything should happen—"</p>
<p n="582"><said>"Ay, by God! and the best too,"</said> said Mr. Standish.</p>
<p n="583"><said>"Miss Garth, I suppose?"</said> said the Vicar, examining some labels very closely.</p>
<p n="584"><said>"I'll believe you!"</said> said Mrs. Dollop, with a touch of scorn at Mr. Crabbe's apparent dimness. <said>"When a man's been 'ticed to a lone house, and there's them can pay for hospitals and nurses for half the country-side choose to be sitters-up night and day, and nobody to come near but a doctor as is known to stick at nothingk, and as poor as he can hang together, and after that so flush o' money as he can pay off Mr. Byles the butcher as his bill has been running on for the best o' joints since last Michaelmas was a twelvemonth—I don't want anybody to come and tell me as there's been more going on nor the Prayer-book's got a service for—I don't want to stand winking and blinking and thinking."</said></p>
<p n="585"><said>"Why not? One lives on them better than on unflattering ones. If we can't be married in two years, the truth will be quite bad enough when it comes."</said></p>
<p n="586">On a gray but dry November morning Dorothea drove to Lowick in company with her uncle and Celia. Mr. Casaubon's home was the manor-house. Close by, visible from some parts of the garden, was the little church, with the old parsonage opposite. In the beginning of his career, Mr. Casaubon had only held the living, but the death of his brother had put him in possession of the manor also. It had a small park, with a fine old oak here and there, and an avenue of limes towards the southwest front, with a sunk fence between park and pleasure-ground, so that from the drawing-room windows the glance swept uninterruptedly along a slope of greensward till the limes ended in a level of corn and pastures, which often seemed to melt into a lake under the setting sun. This was the happy side of the house, for the south and east looked rather melancholy even under the brightest morning. The grounds here were more confined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and large clumps of trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten yards from the windows. The building, of greenish stone, was in the old English style, not ugly, but small-windowed and melancholy-looking: the sort of house that must have children, many flowers, open windows, and little vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home. In this latter end of autumn, with a sparse remnant of yellow leaves falling slowly athwart the dark evergreens in a stillness without sunshine, the house too had an air of autumnal decline, and Mr. Casaubon, when he presented himself, had no bloom that could be thrown into relief by that background.</p>
<p n="587"><said>"I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her, and meant to make her an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him as an envoy, there is an end to that better prospect."</said> There was a severe precision in Mrs. Garth's utterance. She was vexed and disappointed, but she was bent on abstaining from useless words.</p>
<p n="588">That change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or betrayed in his conversation with Lydgate, had been determined in him by some severe experience which he had gone through since the epoch of Mr. Larcher's sale, when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw, and when the banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move Divine Providence to arrest painful consequences.</p>
<p n="589"><said>"Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,"</said> urged Letty, whose life was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl.</p>
<p n="590"><said>"It is True, though—what your brother says, Rosamond,"</said> Mrs. Vincy began, when the servant had cleared the table. <said>"It is a thousand pities you haven't patience to go and see your uncle more, so proud of you as he is, and wanted you to live with him. There's no knowing what he might have done for you as well as for Fred. God knows, I'm fond of having you at home with me, but I can part with my children for their good. And now it stands to reason that your uncle Featherstone will do something for Mary Garth."</said></p>
<p n="591">One day that she went to Freshitt to fulfil her promise of staying all night and seeing baby washed, Mrs. Cadwallader came to dine, the Rector being gone on a fishing excursion. It was a warm evening, and even in the delightful drawing-room, where the fine old turf sloped from the open window towards a lilied pool and well-planted mounds, the heat was enough to make Celia in her white muslin and light curls reflect with pity on what Dodo must feel in her black dress and close cap. But this was not until some episodes with baby were over, and had left her mind at leisure. She had seated herself and taken up a fan for some time before she said, in her quiet guttural—</p>
<p n="592">He hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and she sat in silent expectation. At last he turned towards her and said impetuously—</p>
<p n="593"><said>"I am aware of it,"</said> said Dorothea, coldly. <said>"I think it would do Celia good—if she would take to it."</said></p>
<p n="594"><said>"Good heavens, Celia!"</said> said Sir James, much wrought upon, <said>"what do you wish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow if you wish it." </said>And Celia did wish it.</p>
<p n="595">Christy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred's beautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred's tailoring suggested the advantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of looking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.</p>
<p n="596">Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room, swinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation. At last he stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, <said>"I'll tell you what! Give us a couple of hundreds—come, that's modest—and I'll go away—honour bright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up my liberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like. Perhaps it may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend; perhaps not. Have you the money with you?"</said></p>
<p n="597"><said>"Was I ever high-coloured, Tantripp?"</said> said Dorothea, smiling faintly.</p>
<p n="598"><said>"Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know."</said></p>
<p n="599">Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired, namely, that in case of Bulstrode's departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms proposed.</p>
<p n="600">Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—</p>
<p n="601"><said>"Do trust me,"</said> said Dorothea; <said>"I will not repeat anything without your leave. But at the very least, I could say that you have made all the circumstances clear to me, and that I know you are not in any way guilty. Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James Chettam. Nay, there are persons in Middlemarch to whom I could go; although they don't know much of me, they would believe me. They would know that I could have no other motive than truth and justice. I would take any pains to clear you. I have very little to do. There is nothing better that I can do in the world."</said></p>
<p n="602"><said>"No, he has no bent towards exploration, or the enlargement of our geognosis: that would be a special purpose which I could recognize with some approbation, though without felicitating him on a career which so often ends in premature and violent death. But so far is he from having any desire for a more accurate knowledge of the earth's surface, that he said he should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile, and that there should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds for the poetic imagination."</said></p>
<p n="603">"O me, O me, what frugal cheer My love doth feed upon! A touch, a ray, that is not here, A shadow that is gone:</p>
    <p n="604"><said>"I thought it better to tell you that your name is mixed up with the disclosures,"</said> said Lydgate, who could understand better than most men how Ladislaw might be stung by the revelation. <said>"You will be sure to hear it as soon as you turn out into the town. I suppose it is True that Raffles spoke to you."</said></p>
<p n="605"><said>"Well, no,"</said> said Sir James; <said>"I feel a delicacy in appearing to dictate. But I have been talking to this young Ladislaw that Brooke is making a factotum of. Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it as well to hear what he had to say; and he is against Brooke's standing this time. I think he'll turn him round: I think the nomination may be staved off."</said></p>
<p n="606"><said>"How very beautiful these gems are!"</said> said Dorothea, under a new current of feeling, as sudden as the gleam. <said>"It is strange how deeply colours seem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They look like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful than any of them."</said></p>
<p n="607">Mr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an exclamation, a silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of unusual emotion. He had not been in good spirits about trade that morning, and the slight bitterness in his lips grew intense as he listened. When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute, during which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his desk and turned the key emphatically. Then he looked at his son steadily, and said—</p>
<p n="608"><said>"No, no, dear, no,"</said> said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless deprecation.</p>
<p n="609"><said>"How do you know what men would fall in love with? Girls never know."</said></p>
<p n="610"><said>"She says, he is a great soul.—A great bladder for dried peas to rattle in!"</said> said Mrs. Cadwallader.</p>
<p n="611"><said>"There you go! That is a piece of clap-trap you have got ready for the hustings. Now, do not let them lure you to the hustings, my dear Mr. Brooke. A man always makes a fool of himself, speechifying: there's no excuse but being on the right side, so that you can ask a blessing on your humming and hawing. You will lose yourself, I forewarn you. You will make a Saturday pie of all parties' opinions, and be pelted by everybody."</said></p>
<p n="612"><said>"I think it describes the smell of grilled bone."</said></p>
<p n="613">Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar laughing at himself, and yet persisting in the exhibition.</p>
<p n="614">Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said, just the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean to pay many such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the evenings; and now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he meant to excuse himself and go.</p>
<p n="615"><said>"Yes,"</said> said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so, but he would not have been comfortable with Dodo. <said>"Shall I go to her? Could I help her, do you think?"</said></p>
<p n="616"><said>"I shall await his communication on the subject,"</said> said Mr. Casaubon.</p>
<p n="617"><said>"Oh, he had a good deal of fighting to the last. And they did exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his work. Then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from Jerusalem to take a great chair at Padua. He died rather miserably."</said></p>
<p n="618"><said>"I should think it is a nice house; I like St. Peter's Place."</said></p>
<p n="619">Mary looked so much moved, that he said after a moment, <said>"Let us walk a little;" </said>and when they were walking he added, <said>"To speak quite plainly, Fred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you would consent to be his wife; but with that prospect, he will try his best at anything you approve."</said></p>
<p n="620"><said>"Children, run away,"</said> said Mrs. Garth; <said>"it is too warm to hang about your friends. Take your brother and show him the rabbits."</said></p>
<p n="621">Meanwhile, in his conversation with Raffles, he had learned something momentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of his longings and terrors. There, he thought, lay an opening towards spiritual, perhaps towards material rescue.</p>
<p n="622"><said>"And what happened to him afterwards?"</said> said Rosamond, with some interest.</p>
<p n="623"><said>"Well, you know, you never mentioned him to me, Standish, else I would have invited him to dine,"</said> said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone through a great deal of inviting for the good of his country.</p>
<p n="624"><said>"I don't like you at all at this moment,"</said> said Mary, retreating, and putting her hands behind her. <said>"I only said that no mortal ever made love to me besides you. And that is no argument that a very wise man ever will," </said>she ended, merrily.</p>
<p n="625"><said>"God bless you, madam!"</said> said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she felt unable to do anything more, now that she had finished tying the bonnet.</p>
<p n="626"><said>"I should like it very much, if I may,"</said> said Mary. <said>"Everything seems too happy for me all at once. I thought it would always be part of my life to long for home, and losing that grievance makes me feel rather empty: I suppose it served instead of sense to fill up my mind?"</said></p>
<p n="627">When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make some signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction from her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now rose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical man.</p>
<p n="628"><said>"I don't see the good of that,"</said> said Mr. Hawley. <said>"I suppose we all know whom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice does not wait till the last minute to hear both sides of the question. I have no time to lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote at once."</said></p>
<p n="629"><said>"I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham. It would have cost me pain enough to do it, yet it might have been of some use. But it has been of no use for me to think of anything. You have always been counteracting me secretly. You delude me with a False assent, and then I am at the mercy of your devices. If you mean to resist every wish I express, say so and defy me. I shall at least know what I am doing then."</said></p>
<p n="630"><said>"I am come back in my quality of doctor,"</said> he said. <said>"After I went away, I was haunted by two pale faces: Mrs. Casaubon looked as much in need of care as you, Rosy. And I thought that I had not done my duty in leaving you together; so when I had been to Coleman's I came home again. I noticed that you were walking, Mrs. Casaubon, and the sky has changed—I think we may have rain. May I send some one to order your carriage to come for you?"</said></p>
<p n="631"><said>"Is he? I am glad to hear it,"</said> said Dr. Minchin, with mingled suavity and surprise.</p>
<p n="632">The ladies also talked politics, though more fitfully. Mrs. Cadwallader was strong on the intended creation of peers: she had it for certain from her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other side entirely at the instigation of his wife, who had scented peerages in the air from the very first introduction of the Reform question, and would sign her soul away to take precedence of her younger sister, who had married a baronet. Lady Chettam thought that such conduct was very reprehensible, and remembered that Mrs. Truberry's mother was a Miss Walsingham of Melspring. Celia confessed it was nicer to be "Lady" than "Mrs.," and that Dodo never minded about precedence if she could have her own way. Mrs. Cadwallader held that it was a poor satisfaction to take precedence when everybody about you knew that you had not a drop of good blood in your veins; and Celia again, stopping to look at Arthur, said, <said>"It would be very nice, though, if he were a Viscount—and his lordship's little tooth coming through! He might have been, if James had been an Earl."</said></p>
</sample>
<sample n="4"><p n="633">A chariot was in waiting with four horses; likewise a coach of the kind called glass coaches. Only a very few idlers were collected on account of the dismal rain.</p>
<p n="634">She paced the room trembling and indignant. She went and leaned on the chest of drawers over which the picture hung, and gazed and gazed at it. Its eyes seemed to look down on her with a reproach that deepened as she looked.</p>
<p n="635"><said>“That’s George’s present to you, Rebecca, dear,”</said> said Amelia, quite proud of the bandbox conveying these gifts. <said>“What a taste he has! There’s nobody like him.”</said></p>
<p n="636">Miss Sedley was almost as flurried at the act of defiance as Miss Jemima had been; for, consider, it was but one minute that she had left school, and the impressions of six years are not got over in that space of time. Nay, with some persons those awes and terrors of youth last for ever and ever. I know, for instance, an old gentleman of sixty-eight, who said to me one morning at breakfast, with a very agitated countenance, <said>“I dreamed last night that I was flogged by Dr. Raine.”</said> Fancy had carried him back five-and-fifty years in the course of that evening. Dr. Raine and his rod were just as awful to him in his heart, then, at sixty-eight, as they had been at thirteen. If the Doctor, with a large birch, had appeared bodily to him, even at the age of threescore and eight, and had said in awful voice, <said>“boy, take down your pant…?” </said>Well, well, Miss Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this act of insubordination.</p>
<p n="637">Ere that event, many notes had passed, as may be imagined, between the two dear friends. During the months of Rebecca’s stay in Hampshire, the eternal friendship had (must it be owned?) suffered considerable diminution, and grown so decrepit and feeble with old age as to threaten demise altogether. The fact is, both girls had their own real affairs to think of: Rebecca her advance with her employers—Amelia her own absorbing topic. When the two girls met, and flew into each other’s arms with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of young ladies towards each other, Rebecca performed her part of the embrace with the most perfect briskness and energy. Poor little Amelia blushed as she kissed her friend, and thought she had been guilty of something very like coldness towards her.</p>
<p n="638"><said>“Well, Becky would have made a good Lady Crawley, after all,”</said> Miss Crawley remarked (who was mollified by the girl’s refusal, and very liberal and generous now there was no call for her sacrifices). <said>“She has brains in plenty (much more wit in her little finger than you have, my poor dear Briggs, in all your head). Her manners are excellent, now I have formed her. She is a Montmorency, Briggs, and blood is something, though I despise it for my part; and she would have held her own amongst those pompous stupid Hampshire people much better than that unfortunate ironmonger’s daughter.”</said></p>
<p n="639">Osborne rose too, and shook him heartily by the hand, and said, <said>“How do, my dear boy?” </said>with a cordiality that made poor George’s ambassador feel doubly guilty. His hand lay as if dead in the old gentelman’s grasp. He felt that he, Dobbin, was more or less the cause of all that had happened. It was he had brought back George to Amelia: it was he had applauded, encouraged, transacted almost the marriage which he was come to reveal to George’s father: and the latter was receiving him with smiles of welcome; patting him on the shoulder, and calling him “Dobbin, my dear boy.” The envoy had indeed good reason to hang his head.</p>
<p n="640"><said>“Yes,”</said> said Georgy. The Colonel, who had been looking at him with some interest, took up the child and put him on the pony behind Rawdon minor.</p>
<p n="641"><said>“’Twas there ye coorted me, Meejor dear,”</said> the lady said, and the Major assented to this as to every other proposition which was made generally in company.</p>
<p n="642"><said>“It is not that speech of yesterday,”</said> he continued, <said>“which moves you. That is but the pretext, Amelia, or I have loved you and watched you for fifteen years in vain. Have I not learned in that time to read all your feelings, and look into your thoughts? I know what your heart is capable of: it can cling faithfully to a recollection, and cherish a fancy; but it can’t feel such an attachment as mine deserves to mate with, and such as I would have won from a woman more generous than you. No, you are not worthy of the love which I have devoted to you. I knew all along that the prize I had set my life on was not worth the winning; that I was a fool, with fond fancies, too, bartering away my all of truth and ardour against your little feeble remnant of love. I will bargain no more. I withdraw. I find no fault with you. You are very good-natured, and have done your best; but you couldn’t—you couldn’t reach up to the height of the attachment which I bore you, and which a loftier soul than yours might have been proud to share. Good-bye, Amelia! I have watched your struggle. Let it end. We are both weary of it.”</said></p>
<p n="643"><said>“No, my dear; I’m hanged if I wasn’t afraid when it came to the point.”</said></p>
<p n="644">The man was not of the Captain’s company, but he lifted up his unwounded arm and touched his cap sadly and respectfully to the haggard broken-spirited gentleman who questioned him. <said>“The whole army didn’t contain a finer or a better officer,” </said>the soldier said. <said>“The Sergeant of the Captain’s company (Captain Raymond had it now), was in town, though, and was just well of a shot in the shoulder. His honour might see him if he liked, who could tell him anything he wanted to know about—about the —th’s actions. But his honour had seen Major Dobbin, no doubt, the brave Captain’s great friend; and Mrs. Osborne, who was here too, and had been very bad, he heard everybody say. They say she was out of her mind like for six weeks or more. But your honour knows all about that—and asking your pardon”</said>—the man added.</p>
<p n="645"><said>“Faith, you’re right,”</said> interposed the Major.</p>
<p n="646"><said>“You foolish creature! Who would take you, I should like to know, with your yellow face?”</said></p>
<p n="647">She had had a little black profile of him done for a shilling; and this was hung up by the side of another portrait over her bed. One day the boy came on his accustomed visit, galloping down the little street at Brompton, and bringing, as usual, all the inhabitants to the windows to admire his splendour, and with great eagerness, and a look of triumph in his face, he pulled a case out of his great-coat—(it was a natty white great-coat, with a cape and a velvet collar)—pulled out a red morocco case, which he gave her.</p>
<p n="648"><said>“Your Ladyship will be pleased to recollect that I am the head of this family,”</said> Sir Pitt replied. “If you please, Lady Jane, you will write a letter to Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, requesting her presence upon this melancholy occasion.”</p>
<p n="649">Pitt Crawley received this communication very graciously—more graciously than Miss Crawley had received some of Rebecca’s previous compositions in Rawdon’s handwriting; and as for Lady Jane, she was so charmed with the letter, that she expected her husband would instantly divide his aunt’s legacy into two equal portions, and send off one-half to his brother at Paris.</p>
<p n="650"><said>“What good can I do her, suppose—suppose the enemy arrive?”</said> Jos answered. <said>“They’ll spare the women; but my man tells me that they have taken an oath to give no quarter to the men—the dastardly cowards.”</said></p>
<p n="651">At the romantic hour of dinner, Mr. Georgy made his appearance, and again remarked the absence of “Old Dob.” The meal was eaten in silence by the party. Jos’s appetite not being diminished, but Emmy taking nothing at all.</p>
<p n="652">She looked him hard in the face for a moment—and then turning white too—said, <said>“Lord bless me—it’s Major Dobbin.”</said> She held out both her hands shaking—<said>“Don’t you remember me?”</said> she said. <said>“I used to call you Major Sugar-plums.”</said> On which, and I believe it was for the first time that he ever so conducted himself in his life, the Major took the girl in his arms and kissed her. She began to laugh and cry hysterically, and calling out <said>“Ma, Pa!”</said> with all her voice, brought up those worthy people, who had already been surveying the Major from the casement of the ornamental kitchen, and were astonished to find their daughter in the little passage in the embrace of a great tall man in a blue frock-coat and white duck trowsers.</p>
<p n="653"><said>“Then, why not come away with me?”</said> said Dobbin in reply; but Jos had not the courage. <said>“He would see Dobbin again in the morning; he must on no account say that he had been there. He must go now. Becky might come in.” And Dobbin quitted him full of forebodings.</said></p>
<p n="654"><said>“I’m glad the little ’un isn’t at home,”</said> Rawdon said, biting his nails. <said>“You remember him, Mac, don’t you, in the Riding School? How he sat the kicker to be sure! didn’t he?”</said></p>
<p n="655">Little Rawdon being disposed of Lord Steyne, who took such a parental interest in the affairs of this amiable poor family, thought that their expenses might be very advantageously curtailed by the departure of Miss Briggs; and that Becky was quite clever enough to take the management of her own house. It has been narrated in a former chapter, how the benevolent nobleman had given his protégé money to pay off her little debt to Miss Briggs, who however still remained behind with her friends; whence my lord came to the painful conclusion that Mrs. Crawley had made some other use of the money confided to her than that for which her generous patron had given the loan. However, Lord Steyne was not so rude as to impart his suspicions upon this head to Mrs. Becky, whose feelings might be hurt by any controversy on the money question, and who might have a thousand painful reasons for disposing otherwise of his lordship’s generous loan. But he determined to satisfy himself of the real state of the case: and instituted the necessary inquiries in a most cautious and delicate manner.</p>
<p n="656">Amelia’s manners were such when she and George visited Crawley and his wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first quarrel; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident unwillingness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which she comported herself towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend; and Amelia did not say one single word in reply; but with her husband’s eye upon her and Rebecca scanning her, as she felt, was, if possible, more bashful and awkward on the second visit which she paid to Mrs. Rawdon, than on her first call.</p>
<p n="657">The sisters began to play the Battle of Prague. <said>“Stop that d—— thing,”</said> George howled out in a fury from the sofa. <said>“It makes me mad. You play us something, Miss Swartz, do. Sing something, anything but the Battle of Prague.”</said></p>
<p n="658">In the postscript of Miss Dobbin’s cross-letter, the Major had just come upon a paragraph, to the following effect:—“I drove yesterday to see your old acquaintance, Mrs. Osborne. The wretched place they live at, since they were bankrupts, you know—Mr. S., to judge from a brass plate on the door of his hut (it is little better) is a coal merchant The little boy, your godson, is certainly a fine child, though forward, and inclined to be saucy and self-willed. But we have taken notice of him as you wish it, and have introduced him to his aunt, Miss O., who was rather pleased with him. Perhaps his grandpapa, not the bankrupt one, who is almost doting, but Mr. Osborne, of Russell Square, may be induced to relent towards the child of your friend, his erring and self-willed son. And Amelia will not be ill-disposed to give him up. The widow is consoled, and is about to marry a reverend gentleman, the Rev. Mr. Binny, one of the curates of Brompton. A poor match. But Mrs. O. is getting old, and I saw a great deal of grey in her hair—she was in very good spirits: and your little godson overate himself at our house. Mamma sends her love with that of your affectionate, Ann Dobbin.”</p>
<p n="659"><said>“Then those friends who had the honour of partaking of Mr. Osborne’s hospitality, gentlemen, had no reason, I will lay any wager, to complain of their repast. I myself have been more than once so favoured. (By the way, Master Osborne, you came a little late this morning, and have been a defaulter in this respect more than once.) I myself, I say, gentlemen, humble as I am, have been found not unworthy to share Mr. Osborne’s elegant hospitality. And though I have feasted with the great and noble of the world—for I presume that I may call my excellent friend and patron, the Right Honourable George Earl of Bareacres, one of the number—yet I assure you that the board of the British merchant was to the full as richly served, and his reception as gratifying and noble. Mr. Bluck, sir, we will resume, if you please, that passage of Eutropius, which was interrupted by the late arrival of Master Osborne.”</said></p>
<p n="660"><said>“She’s beside herself with grief,”</said> he resumed. <said>“The agonies that woman has endured are quite frightful to hear of. She had a little boy, of the same age as Georgy.”</said></p>
<p n="661">Even with the most selfish disposition, the Vanity-fairian, as he witnesses this sordid part of the obsequies of a departed friend, can’t but feel some sympathies and regret. My Lord Dives’s remains are in the family vault: the statuaries are cutting an inscription veraciously commemorating his virtues, and the sorrows of his heir, who is disposing of his goods. What guest at Dives’s table can pass the familiar house without a sigh?—the familiar house of which the lights used to shine so cheerfully at seven o’clock, of which the hall-doors opened so readily, of which the obsequious servants, as you passed up the comfortable stair, sounded your name from landing to landing, until it reached the apartment where jolly old Dives welcomed his friends! What a number of them he had; and what a noble way of entertaining them. How witty people used to be here who were morose when they got out of the door; and how courteous and friendly men who slandered and hated each other everywhere else! He was pompous, but with such a cook what would one not swallow? he was rather dull, perhaps, but would not such wine make any conversation pleasant? We must get some of his Burgundy at any price, the mourners cry at his club. <said>“I got this box at old Dives’s sale,”</said> Pincher says, handing it round, <said>“one of Louis XV.’s mistresses—pretty thing, is it not?—sweet miniature,”</said> and they talk of the way in which young Dives is dissipating his fortune.</p>
<p n="662">A fire was blazing already in Sir Pitt’s apartment (it was Miss Briggs’s room, by the way, who was sent upstairs to sleep with the maid). <said>“I knew I should bring you,”</said> she said, with pleasure beaming in her glance. Indeed, she was really sincerely happy at having him for a guest.</p>
<p n="663">Poor Dobbin; poor old William! That unlucky word had undone the work of many a year—the long laborious edifice of a life of love and constancy—raised, too, upon what secret and hidden foundations, wherein lay buried passions, uncounted struggles, unknown sacrifices—a little word was spoken, and down fell the fair palace of hope—one word, and away flew the bird which he had been trying all his life to lure!</p>
<p n="664">When the Potentate from the Danube made his appearance, the conversation was carried on in the French language, and the Lady Bareacres and the younger ladies found, to their farther mortification, that Mrs. Crawley was much better acquainted with that tongue, and spoke it with a much better accent than they. Becky had met other Hungarian magnates with the army in France in 1816–17. She asked after her friends with great interest. The foreign personages thought that she was a lady of great distinction; and the Prince and the Princess asked severally of Lord Steyne and the Marchioness, whom they conducted to dinner, who was that petite dame who spoke so well?</p>
<p n="665"><said>“You’re a good old fellow, Will. I’ll drink your health, old boy, and farewell to—”</said></p>
<p n="666">The horses were put to. The baggage was strapped on. Francis came out with his master’s sword, cane, and umbrella tied up together, and laid them in the well, and his desk and old tin cocked-hat case, which he placed under the seat. Francis brought out the stained old blue cloak lined with red camlet, which had wrapped the owner up any time these fifteen years, and had manchen Sturm erlebt, as a favourite song of those days said. It had been new for the campaign of Waterloo, and had covered George and William after the night of Quatre Bras.</p>
<p n="667">Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, there sought her presently with consolation, on whose shoulder Amelia wept confidentially, and relieved herself a good deal. <said>“Don’t take on. Miss. I didn’t like to tell you. But none of us in the house have liked her except at fust. I sor her with my own eyes reading your Ma’s letters. Pinner says she’s always about your trinket-box and drawers, and everybody’s drawers, and she’s sure she’s put your white ribbing into her box.”</said></p>
<p n="668"><said>“Presentable?—oh, very well. You wouldn’t see any difference,”</said> Captain Crawley answered. <said>“Do let’s have him when you begin to see a few people; and his whatyecallem—his—inamorata—eh, Miss Sharp; that’s what you call it—comes. Gad, I’ll write him a note, and have him; and I’ll try if he can play piquet as well as billiards. Where does he live, Miss Sharp?”</said></p>
<p n="669">SO the mourning being ready, and Sir Pitt Crawley warned of their arrival, Colonel Crawley and his wife took a couple of places in the same old Highflyer coach, by which Rebecca had travelled in the defunct Baronet’s company, on her first journey into the world some nine years before. How well she remembered the Inn Yard, and the ostler to whom she refused money, and the insinuating Cambridge lad who wrapped her in his coat on the journey! Rawdon took his place outside, and would have liked to drive, but his grief forbade him. He sat by the coachman, and talked about horses and the road the whole way; and who kept the inns, and who horsed the coach by which he had travelled so many a time, when he and Pitt were boys going to Eton. At Mudbury a carriage and a pair of horses received them, with a coachman in black. <said>“It’s the old drag, Rawdon,”</said> Rebecca said, as they got in. <said>“The worms have eaten the cloth a good deal—there’s the stain which Sir Pitt—ha! I see Dawson the Ironmonger has his shutters up—which Sir Pitt made such a noise about. It was a bottle of cherry brandy he broke which we went to fetch for your aunt from Southampton. How time flies, to be sure! that can’t be Polly Talboys, that bouncing girl standing by her mother at the cottage there. I remember her a mangy little urchin picking weeds in the garden.”</said></p>
<p n="670">And Dobbin’s spirit rose with his altered circumstances. He made wonderful advances in scholastic learning. The superb Cuff himself, at whose condescension Dobbin could only blush and wonder, helped him on with his Latin verses; “coached” him in play-hours: carried him triumphantly out of the little-boy class into the middle-sized form; and even there got a fair place for him. It was discovered, that although dull at classical learning, at mathematics he was uncommonly quick. To the contentment of all he passed third in algebra, and got a French prize-book at the public Mid-summer examination. You should have seen his mother’s face when Télémaque (that delicious romance) was presented to him by the Doctor in the face of the whole school and the parents and company, with an inscription to Gulielmo Dobbin. All the boys clapped hands in token of applause and sympathy. His blushes, his stumbles, his awkwardness, and the number of feet which he crushed as he went back to his place, who shall describe or calculate?</p>
<p n="671">There are some splendid tailors’ shops in the High Street of Southampton, in the fine plate-glass windows of which hang gorgeous waistcoats of all sorts, of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson, and pictures of the last new fashions in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses, and holding on to little boys with the exceeding large eyes and curly hair, ogle ladies in riding habits prancing by the Statue of Achilles at Apsley House. Jos, although provided with some of the most splendid vests that Calcutta could furnish, thought he could not go to town until he was supplied with one or two of these garments, and selected a crimson stain, embroidered with gold butterflies, and a black and red velvet tartan with white stripes and a rolling collar, with which, and a rich blue satin stock and a gold pin, consisting of a five-barred gate with a horseman in pink enamel jumping over it, he thought he might make his entry into London with some dignity. For Jos’s former shyness and blundering blushing timidity had given way to a more candid and courageous self-assertion of his worth. <said>“I don’t care about owning it,”</said> Waterloo Sedley would say to his friends, <said>“I am a dressy man:”</said> and though rather uneasy if the ladies looked at him at the Government House balls, and though he blushed and turned away alarmed under their glances, it was chiefly from a dread lest they should make love to him, that he avoided them, being averse to marriage altogether. But there was no such swell in Calcutta as Waterloo Sedley, I have heard say: and he had the handsomest turnout, gave the best bachelor dinners, and had the finest plate in the whole place.</p>
<p n="672">This gentleman, as may be imagined, was not kept long in ignorance of the secret. But his face, when he heard it, showed an amazement which was very different to that look of sentimental wonder which the countenances of the sisters wore. Mr. Bullock was a man of the world, and a junior partner of a wealthy firm. He knew what money was, and the value of it: and a delightful throb of expectation lighted up his little eyes, and caused him to smile on his Maria, as he thought that by this piece of folly of Mr. George’s she might be worth thirty thousand pounds more than he had ever hoped to get with her.</p>
<p n="673"><said>“Well, dearest, to-morrow you must be on the look-out, and go and see her, mind, whether she asks you or no,”</said> Rebecca said, trying to soothe her angry yoke-mate. On which he replied, that he would do exactly as he liked, and would just thank her to keep a civil tongue in her head—and the wounded husband went away, and passed the forenoon at the billiard-room, sulky, silent, and suspicious.</p>
<p n="674">To Miss Eliza Styles,</p>
<p n="675">THERE came a day when the round of decorous pleasures and solemn gaieties in which Mr. Jos Sedley’s family indulged was interrupted by an event which happens in most houses. As you ascend the staircase of your house from the drawing towards the bed-room floors, you may have remarked a little arch in the wall right before you, which at once gives light to the stair which leads from the second storey to the third (where the nursery and servants’ chambers commonly are) and serves for another purpose of utility, of which the undertaker’s men can give you a notion. They rest the coffins upon that arch, or pass them through it so as not to disturb in any unseemly manner the cold tenant slumbering within the black ark.</p>
<p n="676">But it is probable that her old creditors of 1815 found her out and caused her to leave Paris, for the poor little woman was forced to fly from the city rather suddenly; and went thence to Brussels.</p>
<p n="677">It is to be feared that this letter of the Parisian great lady did not by any means advance Mrs. Becky’s interest with her admirable, her respectable, relative. On the contrary, the fury of the old spinster was beyond bounds, when she found what was Rebecca’s situation, and how audaciously she had made use of Miss Crawley’s name, to get an entrée into Parisian society. Too much shaken in mind and body to compose a letter in the French language in reply to that of her correspondent, she dictated to Briggs a furious answer in her own native tongue, repudiating Mrs. Rawdon Crawley altogether, and warning the public to beware of her as a most artful and dangerous person. But as Madame the Duchess of X— had only been twenty years in England, she did not understand a single word of the language, and contented herself by informing Mrs. Rawdon Crawley at their next meeting, that she had received a charming letter from that ch&amp;gravere Mees, and that it was full of benevolent things for Mrs. Crawley, who began seriously to have hopes that the spinster would relent.</p>
<p n="678"><said>“She drank cherry-brandy after dinner,”</said> continued his Reverence, <said>“and took curaçoa with her coffee. I wouldn’t take a glass for a five-pound note: it kills me with heartburn. She can’t stand it, Mrs. Crawley—she must go—flesh and blood won’t bear it! and I lay five to two, Matilda drops in a year.”</said></p>
<p n="679"><said>“I suppose you know best,”</said> Dobbin said, though rather dubiously. <said>“You always were a Tory, and your family’s one of the oldest in England. But——”</said></p>
<p n="680"><said>“After the Opera. Here’s the note of invitation—stop—no, this is another paper—I thought I had it, but it’s of no consequence, and I pledge you my word to the fact. If we had come—and it was only one of Mrs. Wenham’s headaches which prevented us—she suffers under them a good deal, especially in the spring—if we had come, and you had returned home, there would have been no quarrel, no insult, no suspicion—and so it is positively because my poor wife has a headache that you are to bring death down upon two men of honour, and plunge two of the most excellent and ancient families in the kingdom into disgrace and sorrow.”</said></p>
<p n="681"><said>“But I don’t think he could pay if he lost,”</said> Dobbin said; and his advice met with the success which advice usually commands. Osborne and Crawley were repeatedly together now. General Tufto dined abroad almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very close indeed to those of the General) which the Aide-de-camp and his wife occupied in the hotel.</p>
<p n="682"><said>“It’s a fat one and a thin one,”</said> Mr. Bluck said, as a thundering knock came to the door.</p>
<p n="683">At some ten o’clock the clinking of a sabre might have been heard up the stair of the house where the Osbornes occupied a storey in the continental fashion. A knock might have been heard at the kitchen door; and poor Pauline, come back from church, fainted almost with terror as she opened it and saw before her her haggard hussar. He looked as pale as the midnight dragoon who came to disturb Leonora. Pauline would have screamed, but that her cry would have called her masters, and discovered her friend. She stifled her scream, then, and leading her hero into the kitchen, gave him beer, and the choice bits from the dinner, which Jos had not had the heart to taste. The hussar showed he was no ghost by the prodigious quantity of flesh and beer which he devoured—and during the mouthfuls he told his tale of disaster.</p>
<p n="684">It was the death-warrant. All was over. Amelia did not dare to look at Rebecca’s pale face and burning eyes, but she dropt the letter into her friend’s lap; and got up, and went up stairs to her room, and cried her little heart out.</p>
<p n="685"><said>“Won’t the monument come round,”</said> Mr. Higgs replied.</p>
<p n="686"><said>“A pretty boy, indeed. Haven’t I heard of your doings, sir, with Lord Tarquin, Captain Crawley of the guards, the Honourable Mr. Deuceace and that set. Have a care, sir, have a care.”</said></p>
<p n="687"><said>“He shall not have any medicine but that which Mr. Pestler sends for him. He told me that Daffy’s Elixir was poison.”</said></p>
<p n="688">There was a buxom Irish servant-girl, who performed all the duties of the little house where the Sedley family had found refuge: and this girl had in vain, on many previous days, striven to give Amelia aid or consolation. Emmy was much too sad to answer, or even to be aware of the attempts the other was making in her favour.</p>
<p n="689"><said>“I thought you liked the City families pretty well,”</said> he said, haughtily.</p>
<p n="690"><said>“You, forsooth, must give yourself airs of virtue; while my wife, who is an immaculate saint, as everybody knows, and never did wrong in her life, has no objection to meet my young friend Mrs. Crawly. My Lady Stere knows that appearances are sometimes against the best of women; that lies are often told about the most innocent of them. Pray, Madam, shall I tell you some little anecdotes about my Lady Bare acres, your mamma?”</said></p>
<p n="691">Well, meanwhile Becky was the greatest comfort and convenience to her, and she gave her a couple of new gowns, and an old necklace and shawl, and showed her friendship by abusing all her intimate acquaintances to her new confidante (than which there can’t be a more touching proof of regard), and meditated vaguely some great future benefit—to marry her perhaps to Clump, the apothecary, or to settle her in some advantageous way of life; or at any rate, to send her back to Queen’s Crawley when she had done with her, and the full London season had begun.</p>
<p n="692">Amelia, on the other hand, as became a young woman of her prudence and temperament, was quite enthusiastic for the match. Once or twice Jos had been on the point of saying something very important to her, to which she was most willing to lend an ear, but the fat fellow could not be brought to unbosom himself of his great secret, and very much to his sister’s disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned away.</p>
<p n="693">It grew to be broad daylight as they stood here, and fresh news began to arrive from the war, brought by men who had been actors in the scene. Wagons and long country carts laden with wounded came rolling into the town; ghastly groans came from within them, and haggard faces looked up sadly from out of the straw. Jos Sedley was looking at one of these carriages with a painful curiosity—the moans of the people within were frightful—the wearied horses could hardly pull the cart. <said>“Stop! stop!”</said> a feeble voice cried from the straw, and the carriage stopped opposite Mr. Sedley’s hotel.</p>
<p n="694">John Sedley had not the heart to review the domestic establishment who have appeared now and anon in our pages, and of whom he was now forced by poverty to take leave.</p>
<p n="695">Briggs and Firkin at the door opened the eyes of astonishment and the lips of wonder.</p>
<p n="696"><said>“When do you intend to give up play, George, as you have promised me, any time these hundred years?”</said> Dobbin said to his friend a few days after the night at the Opera.</p>
<p n="697">George accepted the invitation, although his wife was a little ailing. They were now not quite six weeks married. Another woman was laughing or sneering at her expense and he not angry. He was not even angry with himself, this good-natured fellow. It is a shame, he owned to himself; but hang it, if a pretty woman will throw herself in your way, why, what can a fellow do, you know? I am rather free about women, he had often said, smiling and nodding knowingly to Stubble and Spooney, and other comrades of the mess-table; and they rather respected him than otherwise for this prowess. Next to conquering in war, conquering in love has been a source of pride, time out of mind, amongst men in Vanity Fair, or how should school-boys brag of their amours, or Don Juan be popular?</p>
<p n="698"><said>“Thank you, dear Joseph,”</said> said Amelia, quite ready to kiss her brother, if he were so minded. (And I think for a kiss from such a dear creature as Amelia, I would purchase all Mr. Lee’s conservatories out of hand.)</p>
<p n="699">Amelia flung the bottle crashing into the fireplace. <said>“I will not have baby poisoned, mamma,”</said> cried Emmy, rocking the infant about violently with both her arms round him, and turning with flashing eyes at her mother.</p>
<p n="700">That altered, frightened, fat face, told his secret well enough. He too wanted to fly, and was on the look-out for the means of escape. <said>“He shall buy my horses,”</said> thought Rebecca, <said>“and I’ll ride the mare.”</said></p>
<p n="701">His successes were so repeated that no wonder the envious and the vanquished spoke sometimes with bitterness regarding them. And as the French say of the Duke of Wellington, who never suffered a defeat, that only an astonishing series of lucky accidents enabled him to be an invariable winner; yet even they allow that he cheated at Waterloo, and was enabled to win the last great trick:—so it was hinted at head-quarters in England, that some foul play must have taken place in order to account for the continuous successes of Colonel Crawley.</p>
<p n="702"><said>“Is he a man in a line-regiment?”</said> Captain Crawley asked, remembering after an effort, as became a guardsman, the number of the regiment, the —th.</p>
<p n="703">This was no other than Captain William Dobbin, of His Majesty’s —— Regiment of Foot, returned from yellow fever, in the West Indies, to which the fortune of the service had ordered his regiment, whilst so many of his gallant comrades were reaping glory in the Peninsula.</p>
<p n="704">So she wisely determined to render her position with the Queen’s Crawley family comfortable and secure, and to this end resolved to make friends of every one around her who could at all interfere with her comfort.</p>
<p n="705">So Becky bowed Jos out of her little garret with as much grace as if it was a palace of which she did the honours; and that heavy gentleman having disappeared down the stairs, Max and Fritz came out of their hole, pipe in mouth, and she amused herself by mimicking Jos to them as she munched her cold bread and sausage and took draughts of her favourite brandy-and-water.</p>
<p n="706">I hope the reader has much too good an opinion of Captain and Mrs. Crawley to suppose that they ever would have dreamed of paying a visit to so remote a district as Bloomsbury, if they thought the family whom they proposed to honour with a visit were not merely out of fashion, but out of money, and could be serviceable to them in no possible manner. Rebecca was entirely surprised at the sight of the comfortable old house where she had met with no small kindness, ransacked by brokers and bargainers, and its quiet family treasures given up to public desecration and plunder. A month after her flight, she had bethought her of Amelia, and Rawdon, with a horse-laugh, had expressed a perfect willingness to see young George Osborne again. <said>“He’s a very agreeable acquaintance, Beck,”</said> the wag added. <said>“I’d like to sell him another horse, Beck. I’d like to play a few more games at billiards with him. He’d be what I call useful just now, Mrs. C.—ha, ha!”</said> by which sort of speech it is not to be supposed that Rawdon Crawley had a deliberate desire to cheat Mr. Osborne at play, but only wished to take that fair advantage of him which almost every sporting gentleman in Vanity Fair considers to be his due from his neighbour.</p>
<p n="707"><said>“What is birth, my dear?”</said> she would say to Rebecca—<said>“Look at my brother Pitt; look at the Huddlestons, who have been here since Henry II.; look at poor Bute at the parsonage;—is any one of them equal to you in intelligence or breeding? Equal to you—they are not even equal to poor dear Riggs, my companion, or Bowls, my butler. You, my love, are a little paragon—positively a little jewel—You have more brains than half the shire—if merit had its reward you ought to be a Duchess—no, there ought to be no duchesses at all—but you ought to have no superior, and I consider you, my love, as my equal in every respect; and—will you put some coals on the fire, my dear; and will you pick this dress of mine, and alter it, you who can do it so well?”</said><said> So this old philanthropist used to make her equal run her errands, execute her millinery, and read her to sleep with French novels, every night.</said></p>
<p n="708"><said>“My dear friend, remember it is not poor Lady Jane’s fault that she is well born,”</said> Pitt replied, with a courtly air. <said>“She cannot help being a lady. Besides, I am a Tory, you know.”</said></p>
<p n="709"><said>“P.S.—Mr. Osborne desires me to say, once for all, that he declines to receive any messages, letters, or communications from you on this or any other subject.”</said></p>
<p n="710">Some of Mrs. Rawdon Crawley’s acquaintances, however, acknowledged her readily enough,—perhaps more readily than she would have desired. Among those were Major Loder (unattached), and Captain Rook (late of the Rifles), who might be seen any day on the Dyke, smoking and staring at the women, and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable board and select circle of Mr. Joseph Sedley. In fact they would take no denial; they burst into the house whether Becky was at home or not, walked into Mrs. Osborne’s drawing-room, which they perfumed with their coats and mustachios, called Jos <said>“Old buck,”</said> and invaded his dinner-table, and laughed and drank for long hours there.</p>
<p n="711">FRANKNESS and kindness like Amelia’s were likely to touch even such a hardened little reprobate as Becky. She returned Emmy’s caresses and kind speeches with something very like gratitude, and an emotion which, if it was not lasting, for a moment was almost genuine. That was a lucky stroke of hers about the child “torn from her arms shrieking.” It was by that harrowing misfortune that Becky had won her friend back, and it was one of the very first points, we may be certain, upon which our poor simple little Emmy began to talk to her new-found acquaintance.</p>
<p n="712">It was in this very attitude that Lady Jane, who, returning from church, ran to her husband’s room directly she heard Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was closeted there, found the Baronet and his sister-in-law.</p>
<p n="713">Emmy’s mind somehow misgave her about her friend. Rebecca’s wit, spirits, and accomplishments troubled her with a rueful disquiet. They were only a week married, and here was George already suffering ennui, and eager for othres’ society! She trembled for the future. How shall I be a companion for him, she thought,—so clever and so brilliant, and I such a humble foolish creature? How noble it was of him to marry me—to give up everything and stoop down to me! I ought to have refused him, only I had not the heart. I ought to have stopped at home and taken care of poor papa. And her neglect of her parents (and indeed there was some foundation for this charge which the poor child’s uneasy conscience brought against her) was now remembered for the first time, and caused her to blush with humiliation. Oh! thought she, I have been very wicked and selfish—selfish in forgetting them in their sorrows—selfish in forcing George to marry me. I know I’m not worthy of him—I know he would have been happy without me—and yet—I tried, I tried to give him up.</p>
<p n="714"><said>“Why?”</said> answered the other, still more sadly. <said>“That I may be only the more unhap—unwilling to lose you?”</said> And she turned away her head. Amelia began to give way to that natural infirmity of tears which, we have said, was one of the defects of this silly little thing. George Osborne looked at the two young women with a touched curiosity; and Joseph Sedley heaved something very like a sigh out of his big chest, as he cast his eyes down towards his favourite Hessian boots.</p>
<p n="715">It is related, with regard to the borough of Queen’s Crawley, that Queen Elizabeth in one of her progresses, stopping at Crawley to breakfast, was so delighted with some remarkably fine Hampshire beer which was then presented to her by the Crawley of the day (a handsome gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg), that she forthwith erected Crawley into a borough to send two members to Parliament; and the place, from the day of that illustrious visit, took the name of Queen’s Crawley, which it holds up to the present moment. And though, by the lapse of time, and those mutations which age produces in empires, cities, and boroughs, Queen’s Crawley was no longer so populous a place as it had been in Queen Bess’s time—nay, was come down to that condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten—yet, as Sir Pitt Crawley would say with perfect justice in his elegant way, <said>“Rotten! be hanged—it produces me a good fifteen hundred a year.”</said></p>
<p n="716"><said>“So do I,”</said> William responded. <said>“I was a deuced deal more nervous than you were that morning. You made a famous breakfast, I remember. Eat something now.”</said></p>
<p n="717">At last Dobbin summoned courage to begin. <said>“Sir,”</said> said he, <said>“I’ve brought you some very grave news. I have been at the Horse Guards this morning, and there’s no doubt that our regiment will be ordered abroad, and on its way to Belgium before the week is over. And you know, sir, that we shan’t be home again before a tussle which may be fatal to many of us.”</said></p>
<p n="718">Vanity Fair—Vanity Fair! Here was a man, who could not spell, and did not care to read—who had the habits and the cunning of a boor: whose aim in life was pettifoggin who never had a taste, or emotion, or enjoyment, but what was sordid and foul; and yet he had rank, and honours, and power, somehow: and was a dignitary of the land, and a pillar of the state. He was high sheriff, and rode in a golden coach. Great ministers and statesmen courted him; and in Vanity Fair he had a higher place than the most brilliant genius or spotless virtue.</p>
<p n="719">In comparing, too, the poor man’s situation with that of the great, there is (always according to Mr. Eaves) another source of comfort for the former. You who have little or no patrimony to bequeath or to inherit, may be on good terms with your father or your son, whereas the heir of a great prince, such as my Lord Steyne, must naturally be angry at being kept out of his kingdom, and eye the occupant of it with no very agreeable glances. <said>“Take it as a rule,”</said> this sardonic old Eaves would say, <said>“the fathers and elder sons of all great families hate each other. The Crown Prince is always in opposition to the crown or hankering after it. Shakespeare knew the world, my good sir, and when he describes Prince Hal (from whose family the Gaunts pretend to be descended, though they are no more related to John of Gaunt than you are), trying on his father’s coronet, he gives you a natural description of all heirs-apparent. If you were heir to a dukedom and a thousand pounds a day, do you mean to say you would not wish for possession? Pooh! And it stands to reason that every great man, having experienced this feeling towards his father, must be aware that his son entertains it towards himself; and so they can’t but be suspicious and hostile.</said></p>
<p n="720">He was a little wild: how many young men are; and don’t girls like a rake better than a milksop? He hadn’t sown his wild oats as yet, but he would soon: and quit the army now that peace was proclaimed; the Corsican monster locked up at Elba; promotion by consequence over; and no chance left for the display of his undoubted military talents and valour: and his allowance, with Amelia’s settlement, would enable them to take a snug place in the country somewhere, in a good sporting neighbourhood; and he would hunt a little, and farm a little; and they would be very happy. As for remaining in the army as a married man, that was impossible. Fancy Mrs. George Osborne in lodgings in a county town; or; worse still, in the East or West Indies, with a society of officers, and patronised by Mrs. Major O’Dowd! Amelia died with laughing at Osborne’s stories about Mrs. Major O’Dowd He loved her much too fondly to subject her to that horrid woman and her vulgarities, and the rough treatment of a soldier’s wife. He didn’t care for himself—not he; but his dear little girl should take the place in society to which, as his wife, she was entitled: and to these proposals you may be sure she acceded, as she would to any other from the same author.</p>
<p n="721">Rebecca Crawley occupied apartments in this hotel; and had before this period had sundry hostile meetings with the ladies of the Bareacres family. My lady Bareacres cut Mrs. Crawley on the stairs when they met by chance; and in all places where the latter’s name was mentioned, spoke perseveringly ill of her neighbour. The Countess was shocked at the familiarity of General Tufto with the aide-de-camp’s wife. The Lady Blanche avoided her as if she had been an infectious disease. Only the Earl himself kept up a sly occasional acquaintance with her, when out of the jurisdiction of his ladies.</p>
<p n="722">That little scapegrace Georgy Osborne amongst others, whose pockets were always full of dollars, and whose relations were away at the grand festival of the Court, came to the Stadthaus ball in company of his uncle’s courier, Mr. Kirsch, and having only peeped into a play-room at Baden Baden when he hung on Dobbin’s arm, and where, of course, he was not permitted to gamble, came eagerly to this part of the entertainment, and hankered round the tables where the croupiers and the punters were at work. Women were playing; they were masked, some of them; this license was allowed in these wild times of carnival.</p>
<p n="723">So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebecca’s fortunes. She took Jos’s arm, as a matter of course, on going to dinner; she had sate by him on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous “buck” he was, as he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to understand it. All she wanted was the proposal, and ah! how Rebecca now felt the want of a mother!—a dear, tender mother, who would have managed the business in ten minutes, and, in the course of a little delicate confidential conversation, would have extracted the interesting avowal from the bashful lips of the young man!</p>
<p n="724">He led off the first charade. A Turkish officer with an immense plume of feathers (the Janizaries were supposed to be still in existence, and the tarboosh had not as yet displaced the ancient and majestic head-dress of the True believers), was seen couched on a divan, and making believe to puff at a narghile, in which, however, for the sake of the ladies, only a fragrant pastille was allowed to smoke. The Turkish dignitary yawns and expresses signs of weariness and idleness. He claps his hands and Mesrour the Nubian appears, with bare arms, bangles, yataghans, and every Eastern ornament—gaunt, tall, and hideous. He makes a salaam before my lord the Aga.</p>
<p n="725"><said>“Against whom?”</said> Amelia cried.</p>
<p n="726"><said>“What can you want with a shepherd’s dog?”</said> the lively little Southdown continued.</p>
<p n="727"><said>“Well, now will you go?”</said> says the other.</p>
<p n="728"><said>“Very good: you think I’m a murderess, then,”</said> replied Mrs. Sedley. <said>“This is the language you use to your mother. I have met with misfortunes: I have sunk low in life: I have kept my carriage, and now walk on foot: but I did not know I was a murderess before, and thank you for the news.”</said></p>
<p n="729">He had never been presented to any of Rawdon Crawley’s great acquaintances; he had scarcely been invited to Rebecca’s parties; for he was too timid to play much, and his presence bored George and Rawdon equally, who neither of them, perhaps, liked to have a witness of the amusements in which the pair chose to indulge. <said>“Ah!”</said> thought Jos, <said>“now she wants me she comes to me. When there is nobody else in the way she can think about old Joseph Sedley!”</said> But besides these doubts he felt flattered at the idea Rebecca expressed of his courage.</p>
<p n="730"><said>“The sight of her horrid nephew casually in the Park, where I am told the wretch drives with the brazen partner of his crimes,”</said> Mrs. Bute said (letting the cat of selfishness out of the bag of secrecy), <said>“would cause her such a shock, that we should have to bring her back to bed again. She must not go out, Mr. Clump. She shall not go out as long as I remain to watch over her. And as for my health, what matters it? I give it cheerfully, sir. I sacrifice it at the altar of my duty.”</said></p>
<p n="731"><said>“I came to say—and as you stay, Mrs. Crawley, I must say it in your presence—that I think you—you ought not to form a member of the family of my friends. A lady who is separated from her husband, who travels not under her own name, who frequents public gaming-tables—”</said></p>
<p n="732">One day when he should have come down to breakfast, his servant missing him, went into his dressing-room, and found him lying at the foot of the dressing-table in a fit. Miss Osborne was apprised; the doctors were sent for, Georgy stopped away from school; the bleeders and cuppers came. Osborne partially regained cognizance; but never could speak again, though he tried dreadfully once or twice, and in four days died. The doctors went down, and the undertaker’s men went up the stairs; and all the shutters were shut towards the garden in Russell Square. Bullock rushed from the City in a hurry. <said>“How much money had he left to that boy?—not half, surely? Surely share and share alike between the three?”</said> It was an agitating moment.</p>
<p n="733">So the three gentlemen walked down to see the Lightning coach come in. Punctual to the minute, the coach crowded inside and out, the guard blowing his accustomed tune on the horn—the Lightning came tearing down the street, and pulled up at the coach-office.</p>
<p n="734">Becky looked at her husband, and then at Sir Pit, with an air of saucy triumph—as much as to say, <said>“Shall I betray you?”</said></p>
<p n="735"><said>“Ring the bell, James,”</said> Mrs. Bute said. <said>“Go on ringing it till the people come.”</said> The three or four domestics resident in the deserted old house came presently at that jangling and continued summons.</p>
<p n="736"><said>“You don’t mean to say that—that Crawley’s mistaken?”</said> said Mr. Macmurdo.</p>
<p n="737">The Captain continued that deleterious amusement of smoking, long after the inn and the street were gone to bed. He watched the lights vanish from George’s sitting-room windows, and shine out in the bedroom close at hand. It was almost morning when he returned to his own quarters. He could hear the cheering from the ships in the river, where the transports were already taking in their cargoes preparatory to dropping down the Thames.</p>
<p n="738">He loved his daughter with more fondness now, perhaps, than ever he had done since the days of her childhood. In the discharge of gentle offices and kind filial duties, this simple creature shone most especially. <said>“She walks into the room as silently as a sunbeam,”</said> Mr. Dobbin thought, as he saw her passing in and out from her father’s room; a cheerful sweetness lighting up her face as she moved to and fro, graceful and noiseless. When women are brooding over their children, or busied in a sick-room, who has not seen in their faces those sweet angelic beams of love and pity?</p>
<p n="739"><said>“Let me go, I entreat you,”</said> George said.</p>
<p n="740"><said>“At least I have claims to be heard,”</said> Dobbin continued.</p>
<p n="741">Truth obliges us to confess that Rebecca had married a gentleman of this order. Everything was plentiful in his house but ready money, of which their ménage pretty early felt the want; and reading the Gazette one day, and coming upon the announcement of “Lieutenant G. Osborne to be Captain by purchase, vice Smith, who exchanges,” Rawdon uttered that sentiment regarding Amelia’s lover, which ended in the visit to Russell Square.</p>
<p n="742"><said>“I defy anybody not to be good to you, my dear,”</said> said her mother.</p>
<p n="743">The chaise came up presently, and the Major would wait no longer.</p>
<p n="744">An eloquent catalogue appeared in a weekly print, describing his virtues, his magnificence, his talents, and his good actions. His sensibility, his attachment to the illustrious House of Bourbon, with which he claimed an alliance, were such that he could not survive the misfortunes of his august kinsmen. His body was buried at Naples, and his heart—that heart which always beat with every generous and noble emotion—was brought back to Castle Gaunt in a silver urn. <said>“In him,”</said> Mr. Wagg said, <said>“the poor and the Fine Arts have lost a beneficent patron, society one of its most brilliant ornaments, and England one of her loftiest patriots and statesmen,”</said></p>
<p n="745"><said>“Non, Madame,”</said> said the boy: but she must have known, from his accent, of what country he was, for she answered him with a slight foreign tone. <said>“You have nevare played—will you do me a littl’ favor?”</said></p>
<p n="746"><said>“Gracious lady, gracious lady!”</said> said the landlord, knocking at Becky’s door; he had called her Madame the day before, and was by no means courteous to her.</p>
<p n="747"><said>“What do you want with driving to-night?”</said> answered the lady. <said>“Isn’t she better on her bed? I’ve just got her to lie down.”</said></p>
<p n="748">Rebecca had never seen a Baronet, as far as she knew, and as soon as she had taken leave of Amelia, and counted the guineas which good-natured Mr. Sedley had put into a purse for her, and as soon as she had done wiping her eyes with her handkerchief (which operation she concluded the very moment the carriage had turned the corner of the street), she began to depict in her own mind what a baronet must be. <said>“I wonder, does he wear a star?”</said> thought she, <said>“or is it only lords that wear stars? But he will be very handsomely dressed in a court suit, with ruffles, and his hair a little powdered, like Mr. Wroughton at Covent Garden. I suppose he will be awfully proud, and that I shall be treated most contemptuously. Still I must bear my hard lot as well as I can—at least, I shall be amongst gentlefolks, and not with vulgar city people:”</said> and she fell to thinking of her Russell Square friends with that very same philosophical bitterness with which, in a certain apologue, the fox is represented as speaking of the grapes.</p>
<p n="749"><said>“I don’t know his widow, sir,”</said> Osborne said. <said>“Let her go back to her father.”</said> But the gentleman whom he addressed was determined to remain in good temper, and went on without heeding the interruption.</p>
<p n="750">Mr. Osborne was just on the point of knocking down a gentleman in top-boots, who proposed to take advantage of this invitation, and a commotion seemed to be inevitable, when by the greatest good luck a gentleman of the name of Dobbin, who had been walking about the gardens, stepped up to the box. <said>“Be off, you fools!”</said> said this gentleman—shouldering off a great number of the crowd, who vanished presently before his cocked hat and fierce appearance—and he entered the box in a most agitated state.</p>
<p n="751"><said>“I’ll stop and go home with that rascal, Kirsch,”</said> Jos said; and for the same reason of modesty, which he thought ought to be preserved before the boy, Dobbin did not care to remonstrate with Jos, but left him and walked home with Georgy.</p>
<p n="752"><said>“What?”</said> said Barbara, who was biting her nails, and drumming the table.</p>
<p n="753"><said>“George, she’s dying,”</said> William Dobbin said,—and could speak no more.</p>
<p n="754">CONSIDERABLE time has elapsed since we have seen our respectable friend, old Mr. Osborne of Russell Square. He has not been the happiest of mortals since last we met him. Events have occurred which have not improved his temper, and in more instances than one he has not been allowed to have his own way. To be thwarted in this reasonable desire was always very injurious to the old gentleman; and resistance became doubly exasperating when gout, age, loneliness, and the force of many disappointments combined to weigh him down. His stiff black hair began to grow quite white soon after his son’s death; his face grew redder; his hands trembled more and more as he poured out his glass of port wine. He led his clerks a dire life in the City: his family at home were not much happier. I doubt if Rebecca, whom we have seen piously praying for Consols, would have exchanged her poverty and the dare-devil excitement and chances of her life, for Osborne’s money and the humdrum gloom which enveloped him. He had proposed for Miss Swartz, but had been rejected scornfully by the partizans of that lady, who married her to a young sprig of Scotch nobility.</p>
<p n="755"><said>“It’s a family business, sir,”</said> says George, cracking filberts. <said>“You and Mr. Sedley made the match a hundred years ago.”</said></p>
<p n="756">She did not know how much care, thought, and genius Mrs. Radon had bestowed upon that garment. Rebecca had as good taste as any milliner in Europe, and such a clever way of doing things as Lady Jane little understood. The latter quickly spied out the magnificence of the brocade of Becky’s train, and the splendour of the lace on her dress.</p>
<p n="757"><said>“You don’t mean that, Amelia?”</said> William said, sadly. <said>“You don’t mean that these words, uttered in a hurried moment, are to weigh against a whole life’s devotion? I think that George’s memory has not been injured by the way in which I have dealt with it, and if we are come to bandying reproaches, I at least merit none from his widow and the mother of his son. Reflect, afterwards when—when you are at leisure, and your conscience will withdraw this accusation. It does even now,”</said> Amelia held down her head.</p>
<p n="758">The young ladies in Amelia’s society did this for her very satisfactorily. For instance, there was scarcely any point upon which the Misses Osborne, George’s sisters, and the Mesdemoiselles Dobbin agreed so well as in their estimate of her very trifling merits: and their wonder that their brothers could find any charms in her. <said>“We are kind to her,”</said> the Misses Osborne said, a pair of fine black-browed young ladies who had had the best of governesses, masters, and milliners; and they treated her with such extreme kindness and condescension, and patronised her so insufferably, that the poor little thing was in fact perfectly dumb in their presence, and to all outward appearance as stupid as they thought her. She made efforts to like them, as in duty bound, and as sisters of her future husband. She passed “long mornings” with them—the most dreary and serious of forenoons. She drove out solemnly in their great family coach with them, and Miss Wirt their governess, that raw-boned Vestal. They took her to the ancient concerts by way of a treat, and to the oratorio, and to St. Paul’s to see the charity children, where in such terror was she of her friends, she almost did not dare be affected by the hymn the children sang. Their house was comfortable; their papa’s table rich and handsome! their society solemn and genteel; their self-respect prodigious; they had the best pew at the Foundlin all their habits were pompous and orderly, and all their amusements intolerably dull and decorous. After every one of her visits (and oh how glad she was when they were over!) Miss Osborne and Miss Maria Osborne, and Miss Wirt, the vestal governess, asked each other with increased wonder, <said>“What could George find in that creature?”</said></p>
</sample>
<sample n="5"><p n="759"><said>“Yes, I was a little girl then, and knew no better, and once I did tell a lie when mamma asked me, and now she is dead, and I can never tell her the truth.”</said></p>
<p n="760"><said>“Where you are wanted is here. Ermine wants you. I want you. The Temples want you.”</said></p>
<p n="761"><said>“Oh, Mrs. Keith, it is so dreadful. I cannot tell my poor son. I don’t know what might be the consequence.”</said></p>
<p n="762"><said>“Only—only, my dear, people will say such things, and nobody could think it that knew you.”</said></p>
<p n="763"><said>“But is it not very troublesome to you?”</said></p>
<p n="764"><said>“My dear child,”</said> said Colonel Keith, with some exertion of patience, <said>“you must try to be reasonable. How can you possibly recognise a man that you tell me you never saw?”</said></p>
<p n="765"><said>Martinet!</said> thought Rachel, nearly ready to advocate the boys making no toilette at any time; and the present was made to consume so much time that, urged by her, Fanny once more was obliged to summon her boys and their books.</p>
<p n="766"><said>“Alick’s old nook! Keeping up honeymoon privileges! I have kept your secret faithfully. No one knows you are not on the top of Snowdon, or you would have had all the world to call on you.”</said></p>
<p n="767"><said>“You do not know Conrade. He is so trustworthy and affectionate, dear boy, and they are both always good with me. The Major said it often hurts boys to send them too young.”</said></p>
<p n="768"><said>“And was not this more than duty? Ah! I see yours is a spirit of depreciation, and I can only say I pity you.”</said></p>
<p n="769"><said>“And who is Maria?”</said></p>
<p n="770"><said>“Yes,”</said> said Ermine, <said>“he has most loyally kept his word of reserving all for you. He has not even said whether Mauleverer is taken.”</said></p>
<p n="771"><said>“Absurd! She cannot mend with anything on her mind! If I could have seen Mrs. Curtis or Grace alone, they might have heard reason, but that old woman of a doctor was prosing about quiet and strain on the nerves. I know that sort of quiet, the best receipt for distraction!”</said></p>
<p n="772"><said>“My name is Rose, not Ailie,”</said> replied the little girl.</p>
<p n="773"><said>“I see,”</said> said Rachel; “it is the same figure, but not the same shaped picture.”</p>
<p n="774"><said>“Oh, one egg; there’s no harm in taking that; but this nest has young birds.”</said></p>
<p n="775"><said>“Pshaw, Rachel! that is just the way. A few words and pretty ways pass with her and all the world for attention, when she is wherever her fancy calls her, all for his good. It is just the attention she showed my uncle. And now it is her will and pleasure to queen it here among her old friends, and she will not open her eyes to see the poor old man’s precarious state.”</said></p>
<p n="776">Just then his quick ear detected that some one was at the parsonage door, and Rachel, turning round, exclaimed with horror, <said>“It is that unhappy Mr. Carleton.”</said></p>
<p n="777"><said>“Hush, Bessie,”</said> said her brother, roused for the first time into sternness, <said>“this is more than nonsense. One word more of this, and you will cut me off from my greatest rest and pleasure.”</said></p>
<p n="778"><said>“And, Rachel, now that money has been once so intended; suppose it kept its destination. About £500 would put up a tidy little industrial school, and you might not object to have a scholarship or two for some of our little —th Highlander lassies whose fathers won’t make orphans of them for the regular military charities. What, crying, Rachel! Don’t you like it?”</said></p>
<p n="779"><said>“His lordship’ll please himsel’ wi’ a leddy to be mistress o’ Gowanbrae, but auld Tibbie’ll never cross the doorstane mair.”</said></p>
<p n="780"><said>“Don’t,”</said> she said, raising herself. <said>“No, don’t! I have thought more over what you said,”</said> she continued, as if repeating the sentence she had conned over to herself. <said>“You have been most generous, most noble; but—but,”</said> with an effort of memory, <said>“it would be wrong in me to accept such—oh! such a sacrifice; and when I tell you all, you will think it a duty to turn from me,”</said> she added, pressing her hands to her temples. <said>“And mind, you are not committed—you are free.”</said></p>
<p n="781">This alarm, being less reasonable, was even more difficult to talk down than Mrs. Kelland’s, and Rachel felt as if there wore a general conspiracy to drive her distracted, when on going home she found the drawing-room occupied by a pair of plump, paddy-looking old friends, who had evidently talked her mother into a state of nervous alarm. On her entrance, Mrs. Curtis begged the gentleman to tell dear Rachel what he had been saying, but this he contrived to avoid, and only on his departure was Rachel made aware that he and his wife had come, fraught with tidings that she was fostering a Jesuit in disguise, that Mrs. Rawlins was a lady abbess of a new order, Rachel herself in danger of being entrapped, and the whole family likely to be entangled in the mysterious meshes, which, as good Mrs. Curtis more than once repeated, would be <said>“such a dreadful thing for poor Fanny and the boys.”</said></p>
<p n="782"><said>“Why,”</said> said Rachel, recovering her usual manner, <said>“you have not been ten years in the army!”</said></p>
<p n="783"><said>“And you engage to retract all your distrust and contempt, if you are convinced that this engraving is genuine?”</said></p>
<p n="784"><said>“No, indeed! You thought it deformity! Oh, no, no! she was so beautiful.”</said></p>
<p n="785"><said>“Baby! Ah, poor Fanny, I feared that was the reason the did not come sooner.”</said></p>
<p n="786"><said>“It is her dispensary,”</said> said Grace.</p>
<p n="787"><said>“Well, my dear, it may be a good thing for you to have a young lady with you, and if he is to come over, her presence will explain it. Understand me, my dear, I am not at all afraid of your—your doing anything foolish, only to get talked of is so dreadful in your situation, that you can’t be too careful.”</said></p>
<p n="788"><said>“Nor I that kind of man,”</said> he answered in his natural tone; then affectionately, <said>“No, indeed I want you to aid mine.”</said></p>
<p n="789"><said>“I do not see why I should not manage it very well,”</said> said Ermine, cheerfully, <said>“if Miss Curtis will let me know in time whether she is equal to seeing me. You know I can walk into the house now.”</said></p>
<p n="790"><said>“No, I was not her equal in energy and beneficence, and I was younger when you came. But I feel for her longing to be up and doing, and her puzzled chafing against constraint and conventionality, though it breaks out in very odd effervescences.”</said></p>
<p n="791">Self-restrained Alison was fairly overcome. She stretched out both hands, pressed Colin’s convulsively, then turned away her face, and, bursting into tears, ran out of the room.</p>
<p n="792"><said>“Not unless I were very clear that he liked my choice,”</said> said Alick, gravely.</p>
<p n="793"><said>“Oh, then she will be lazy, and not get up when she is called, till I pull all the clothes off, and that will be fun.”</said></p>
<p n="794"><said>“No; I told you it was villafied and cockneyfied. There,”</said> as the horses tried to stop at a lodge leading to a prettily built house, <said>“that’s Timber End, the crack place here, where Bessie has always said it was her ambition to live.”</said></p>
<p n="795"><said>“Edward! How is Ermine?”</said></p>
<p n="796"><said>“Will? Oh, he is always pleased to feel he can do like other people,”</said> returned Bessie, <said>“and I’ll undertake to see that he puts the ring on the right—I mean the left finger. Because you’ll have to give me away, you know, Alick, so you can look after him.”</said></p>
<p n="797"><said>“You have not seen him here before?”</said></p>
<p n="798"><said>“Experimental philosophy,”</said> said Rachel, in rather a considering tone, as if the notion, when presented to her in plain English, required translation into the language of her thoughts.</p>
<p n="799">Rachel’s heart beat high, and her eyes were full of tears of exultation. And the Colonel was well pleased to compensate for all the pain he had inflicted by giving her all the details he could recollect of her husband’s short campaign. They had become excellent friends over their mournful work, and were sorry to have their tete-a-tete interrupted when a message was brought that his Lordship was ready, if Mrs. Keith would be so good as to come into his sitting-room.</p>
<p n="800"><said>“I don’t know what you mean to do. Not to molest that poor Mrs. Rawlins. I will not have that done.”</said></p>
<p n="801"><said>“Yes, that is the thing. I am afraid I can’t be what I ought to be, or people would never think of such nonsense,”</said> said Fanny, with large tears welling into her eyes. <said>“I can’t be guarding that dear memory as I ought, to have two such things happening so soon.”</said></p>
<p n="802"><said>“Yes, if it infected you,”</said> said Rachel, intending some playfullness. <said>“A mother of contracted mind forfeits the allegiance of her sons.”</said></p>
<p n="803"><said>“She knows then?”</said> said Rachel, breathlessly, but on her guard.</p>
<p n="804"><said>“Mr. Maddox.”</said></p>
<p n="806"><said>“It might not be necessary, my lord. Good morning;”</said> and her courteous bow was an absolute dismissal.</p>
<p n="807"><said>“Oh yes, thank you.”</said></p>
<p n="808">Breakfast over, Rachel gathered up her various gifts, and betook herself to a room on the ground floor with all the appliances of an ancient schoolroom. Rather dreamily she took out a number of copy-books, and began to write copies in them in large text hand.</p>
<p n="809"><said>“Your aunt sowed the seed. It is strange that I was very near choosing this place nine years ago, but it could not be seen from my window, which was an object with me then.”</said></p>
<p n="810">The long-looked-for letters came after a weary interval of expectation, the more trying to Ermine because the weather had been so bitter that Colin could not shake off his cold, nor venture beyond his own fireside, where Rose daily visited him, and brought home accounts that did not cheer her aunt.</p>
<p n="811"><said>“Mr. Mauleverer? Yes; I came down as soon as he had left me, only calling first upon Fanny. I am very anxious for contributions. If you would only give me a paper signed by the ‘Invalid,’ it would be a fortune to the institution.”</said></p>
<p n="812"><said>“No, she was obstinate, though her sister and I did our utmost to persuade her, and the boys were crazy to make her go.”</said></p>
<p n="813"><said>“I hope I did not vex you,”</said> said Fanny, afraid of having been severe.</p>
<p n="814">There was some demur, for though the child had made so sudden a rush into the world, there seemed to be no ground for immediate alarm; and Mr. Clare being always at hand, did not think it expedient to give the name without knowing the father’s wishes with regard to that hereditary Alexander which had been borne by the dead son of the first marriage. A message, however, came down to hasten him, and when—as he had often before done in cottages—he demanded of Nurse Jones whether private baptism were immediately necessary, she allowed that she saw no pressing danger, but added, <said>“that the lady was in a way about it,”</said> and this both Rachel and her maid strongly corroborated. Rachel’s maid was an experienced person, whom Mrs. Curtis had selected with a view to Rachel’s weak state at the time of her marriage, and she showed herself anxious for anything that might abate Lady Keith’s excitement, to which they at length yielded, feeling that resistance might be dangerous to her. She further insisted that the rite should be performed in her presence; nor was she satisfied when Rachel had brought in her uncle, but insisted on likewise calling in her brother, who vaguely anxious, and fully conscious of the small size of the room, had remained down-stairs.</p>
<p n="815"><said>“It is such a hope,”</said> he repeated. <said>“There is no reason for laying it aside, because Edward is his old self.”</said></p>
<p n="816"><said>“I could not be satisfied in relinquishing it voluntarily,”</said> said Rachel, <said>“but I am necessarily one of the idle. Were I one of the occupied, laborare est orare would satisfy me, and that poor governess ought to feel the same. Think of the physical reaction of body on mind, and tell me if you could have the barbarity of depriving that poor jaded thing of an hour’s sleep, giving her an additional walk, fasting, in all weathers, and preparing her to be savage with the children.”</said></p>
<p n="817"><said>“Never mind me,”</said> said Colonel Keith, kindly. <said>“Indeed, Lady Temple, it is a wonderful compliment to you that he should have been ready to undertake such a family.”</said></p>
<p n="818">Rachel’s cold, repellent manner was in full force, and she went towards the poor little man, whose girlish face was blanched with fright.</p>
<p n="819">After a few words with Mr. Carleton, Alick strode off to the stables, and Rachel asked anxiously after the twist.</p>
<p n="820"><said>“I dare not ask. I must be passive or I shall be selfish. You are all my world, and Edward has no one. Make them settle it without me. Talk of something else! Tell me how your brother is to be taken care of.”</said></p>
<p n="821"><said>“So soon?”</said> said Ermine; <said>“I have not seen you for a long time.”</said></p>
<p n="822"><said>“Take him? You must know what it is to be in the hands of a clever woman before you make such a proposal.”</said></p>
<p n="823"><said>“No.”</said></p>
<p n="824"><said>“No, I could not think. I only knew they came to get the woman punished for being so cruel to the poor little girls.”</said></p>
<p n="825"><said>“I wish I was grown up!”</said> sighed Conrade; <said>“how I would give it to Aunt Rachel! But why must we live here to have her plaguing us?”</said></p>
<p n="826"><said>“Don’t you think the broad ideas would be rather of the hearsay order, at least to most people, unless their application were worked out in the trifle that came first to hand?”</said></p>
<p n="827"><said>“There is no use in talking of such things,”</said> said Ermine, resolutely, <said>“let us think of what must be thought of, not of what is in the only Wise Hands. What has been done about the other children?”</said></p>
<p n="828"><said>“Oh, I am glad you say that,”</said> she said, looking up, flushed with pleasure now, and her sweet eyes brimming over. <said>“I have tried to think what he would like in all I have done, and you know I can’t help being proud and glad of belonging to him still; and he always told me not to be shy and creeping into the nursery out of every one’s way.”</said></p>
<p n="829"><said>“Not wrong, only a little overdone. You ladies want sometimes to be put in mind that, because a clergyman has to manage his own time, he is not a whit more really at liberty than a soldier or a lawyer, whose hours are fixed for him. You do not do him or his parish any kindness by engrossing him constantly in pastimes that are all very well once in a way, but which he cannot make habitual without detriment to his higher duties.”</said></p>
<p n="830"><said>“Then do not go.”</said></p>
<p n="831"><said>“That is being an honourable woman,”</said> he said, and Rose’s return ended the exchange of speculations; but it must be confessed that at their next meeting Ermine’s look of suppressed inquiry quite compensated for her previous banter, more especially as neither had he any confidence to reveal or conceal, only the tidings that the riders, whose coalition had justified Lady Temple’s prudence, had met Mr. Touchett wandering in the lanes in the twilight, apparently without a clear idea of what he was doing there. And on the next evening there was quite an excitement, the curate looked so ill, and had broken quite down when he was practising with the choir boys before church; he had, indeed, gone safely through the services, but at school he had been entirely at a loss as to what Sunday it was, and had still more unfortunately forgotten that to be extra civil to Miss Villars was the only hope of retaining her services, for he had walked by her with less attention than if she had been the meanest scholar. Nay, when his most faithful curatolatress had offered to submit to him a design for an illumination for Christmas, he had escaped from her with a desperate and mysterious answer that he had nothing to do with illumination, he hoped it would be as sombre as possible.</p>
<p n="832"><said>“That is not a fair question,”</said> said Ermine, smiling. <said>“You know very well that you ought to go.”</said></p>
<p n="833"><said>“What?”</said> demanded Rachel.</p>
<p n="834"><said>“I hope it is more to the purpose than it was then, and it has had to learn to write in all sorts of attitudes.”</said></p>
<p n="835"><said>“Ah! but that is the very thing. If you do not show yourself it will make such a talk.”</said></p>
<p n="837"><said>“Yes, I see,”</said> owned Rachel, and overpowered, though far from satisfied, she allowed herself to be brought back, and did what was required of her, to the intense relief of her mother. During her three minute conference no one in the study had ventured on speaking or stirring, and Mrs. Curtis would not thank her biographer for recording the wild alarms that careered through her brain, as to the object of her daughter’s tete-a-tete with the magistrate.</p>
<p n="838">But they were far from the path, and it was not possible to guide the blind steps rapidly between the graves and head stones, so that before the pathway was reached young Carleton must have received the sad reply to his inquiries, for hurrying from the door he threw himself on his horse, and rode off at full speed.</p>
<p n="839"><said>“May not I judge for myself?”</said> he said, drawing nearer, and his voice falling into tremulous tenderness.</p>
<p n="840"><said>“It will be warm enough by the time I get there.”</said></p>
<p n="841"><said>“Not believing, but knowing,”</said> he answered—<said>“knowing both you and Edward. Besides, is it not almost invariable that the inventor is ruined by his invention—a Prospero by nature?”</said></p>
<p n="842">Ah, Violetta, purchased with a silver groat, what was not your value in Mackarel Lane? Were you not one of its most considered inhabitants, scarcely less a child of Aunt Ermine and Aunt Alison than their Rosebud herself?</p>
<p n="843"><said>“Nothing! The bankruptcy was declared, the whole affair broken up; and certainly if every one had not known Edward to be the most heedless of men, the confusion would have justified them in thinking him a dishonest one. Things had been done in his name by Maddox that might have made a stranger think him guilty of the rest, but to those who had ever known his abstraction, and far more his real honour and uprightness, nothing could have been plainer.”</said></p>
<p n="844"><said>“Poor dear Ailie,”</said> said Ermine; <said>“she has suffered terribly. Her heart is full of Edward. Oh, I hope he will come.”</said></p>
<p n="845"><said>“Ah! I can understand.”</said></p>
<p n="846"><said>“No, you are to set no more people upon me, though Lady Temple’s eyes are very wistful.”</said></p>
<p n="847">He turned about long before Rose thought they had gone far enough, and when he re-entered the parlour there was such an expectant look on his face that Ermine’s bright eyes glittered with merry mischief, when she sent Rose to take off her walking dress. <said>“Well!”</said> he said.</p>
<p n="848"><said>“Not for a month or six weeks, when the wedding will be over. It is high time she saw something of her respected guardian.”</said></p>
<p n="849"><said>“No, don’t say so,”</said> began Fanny, with gentle argument, but Alick Keith put in with a smile, <said>“It is a satisfaction to Miss Curtis.”</said></p>
<p n="850"><said>“Thank you, oh! thank you. The house with the rails, under the east cliff.”</said></p>
<p n="851">Then would come the sobs, terrible in themselves, and ending in fainting, and the whole scene was especially grievous to Alick, even more than to either of the others, for as her perception failed her, association carried her back to old arguments with him, and sometimes it was, <said>“Alick, indeed you do like to attribute motives,”</said> sometimes, <said>“Indeed it is not all self-deception,”</said> or the recurring wail, <said>“Alick is right, only don’t let him be so angry!”</said> If he told her how far he was from anger, she would make him kiss her, or return to some playful rejoinder, more piteous to hear than all, or in the midst would come on the deadly swoon.</p>
<p n="852"><said>“Yes, where you can do it,”</said> said Rachel, <said>“but not where you can’t.”</said></p>
<p n="853">Meantime Rachel studied her own feelings. A few weeks ago her heart would have leapt at the announcement; but now her mission had found her out, and she did not want to be drawn aside from it. Colonel Keith might have many perfections, but alike as Scotsman, soldier, and High-Churchman, he was likely to be critical of the head of the F. U. E. E., and matters had gone too far now for her to afford to doubt, or to receive a doubting master. Moreover, it would be despicable to be diverted from a great purpose by a courtship like any ordinary woman; nor must marriage settlements come to interfere with her building and endowment of the asylum, and ultimate devotion of her property thereunto. No, she would school herself into a system of quiet discouragement, and reserve herself and her means as the nucleus of the great future establishment for maintaining female rights of labour.</p>
<p n="854"><said>“There is not the smallest use in denying it. I know you took it when you and Hubert went away together. Your Aunt Grace found it gone this morning, and one of the poor little birds dead below. What have you done with the others?”</said></p>
<p n="855">Fanny opened her brown eyes, and awaited the words of wisdom.</p>
<p n="856"><said>“There are such things as extraordinary occasions, Rose. Now, good night, my sweet one.”</said></p>
<p n="857"><said>“Then, Grace, there is only one thing to be done. The sooner I take Rachel away the better for both her and the mother.”</said></p>
<p n="858"><said>“I cannot tell, Bessie, I believe it is pure goodnature on Mrs. Huntsford’s part, but if we go, it must be from Rachel’s spontaneous movement. I will not press her on any account. I had rather the world said she was crazy at once than expose her to the risk of one of the dreadful nights that haunted us till we came here to perfect quiet.”</said></p>
<p n="859"><said>“Well, Mrs. Rossitur, I will make every inquiry, and I do not think you will find anything wrong. There must be some one about very like Mrs. Rawlins. I have heard of those pink feathers before, but I know who the matron is, and all about her! Good-bye. I’ll see you again before you go, I suppose it won’t be till the seven o’clock train.”</said></p>
<p n="860"><said>“She wishes it!”</said> said Ermine.</p>
<p n="861"><said>“I should not have thought so, if I had not watched my uncle cast off troubles about his eye-sight and the keeping his living.”</said></p>
<p n="862"><said>“Did you not tell me that she and the Curtises spent the evening with you?”</said></p>
<p n="863"><said>“Poor child! And you never dared to speak of it again?”</said></p>
<p n="864"><said>“Do you remember our axiom? Build your church, and the rest will take care of itself. You remember our scraping and begging, and how that good Mr. Davison helped us out and brought the endowment up to the needful point for consecration, on condition the incumbency was given to him. He held it just a year, and was rich, and could help out his bad health with a curate. But first he went to Madeira, and then he died, and there we are, a perpetual curacy of £70 a year, no resident gentry but ourselves, a fluctuating population mostly sick, our poor demoralized by them, and either crazed by dissent, or heathenized by their former distance from church. Who would take us? No more Mr. Davisons! There was no more novelty, and too much smartness to invite self-devotion. So we were driven from pillar to post till we settled down into this Mr. Touchett, as good a being as ever lived, working as hard as any two, and sparing neither himself nor any one else.”</said></p>
<p n="865"><said>“Have you Indian curiosities! I thought they were only for ladies?”</said></p>
<p n="866"><said>“Yes, poor dear Ermine. She knew he meant to come there to meet her, and she thought it would not be right; because his father had objected so strongly, and made him exchange into a regiment on foreign service.”</said></p>
<p n="867"><said>“Don’t tell me what she says; I have enough of that at first hand.”</said></p>
<p n="868"><said>“I am not overwhelming you,”</said> suddenly exclaimed Rachel, checking herself in mid-career about the mothers’ meetings for the soldiers’ wives.</p>
<p n="869"><said>“Well, since I came into Avonmouth air,”</said> said he, <said>“I fear nothing but cold. I am glad to have brought him with me, since he could not stay there, for it is very lonely for him.”</said></p>
<p n="870"><said>“My inquiries have betrayed me then? It is indeed a trying spectacle.”</said></p>
<p n="871"><said>“Obnoxious sageness in youth is the token that there is stuff behind,”</said> said Alick, with eagerness that set his sister laughing at him for fitting on the cap; but Rachel had a sort of odd dreamy perception that Bessie Keith had unconsciously described her (Rachel’s) own aspect, and that Alick was defending her, and she was silent and confused, and rather surprised at the assumption of the character by one who she thought could never even exert himself to be obnoxious. He evidently did not wish to dwell on the subject, but began to inquire after Avonmouth matters, and Rachel in return asked for Mr. Clare.</p>
<p n="872"><said>“You suspect this Maddox?”</said></p>
<p n="873"><said>“You are too good, sir,”</said> returned Mrs. Curtis; <said>“I am sure I did not mean to object to anything for good. If it is for a charity, I am sure some of our friends would be very glad to take some sketches of our scenery; they have been begging me this long time to have it photographed. I should like to have that drawing myself, it would please your aunt so much, my dear, if we sent it to her.”</said></p>
<p n="874"><said>“That is because they have no perspective in their brains. Rachel understands me a great deal too well to make me explain what is better unspoken.”</said></p>
<p n="875"><said>“A little of both I fancy,”</said> said the Colonel, <said>“but I suspect he is giving me up as a bad job. Ermine, there are ominous revivifications going on at home, and he has got himself rigged out in London, and had his hair cut, so that he looks ten years younger.”</said></p>
<p n="876">In good time, Rachel made her appearance in Miss Williams’s little sitting-room. <said>“I am ready to submit to any test that Captain Keith may require to confute himself,”</said> she said to Ermine; <said>“and I do so the more readily that with all his mocking language, there is a genuine candour and honesty beneath that would be quite worth convincing. I believe that if once persuaded of the injustice of his suspicions he would in the reaction become a fervent supporter of Mr. Mauleverer and of the institution; and though I should prefer carrying on our work entirely through women, yet this interest would be so good a thing for him, that I should by no means reject his assistance.”</said></p>
<p n="877"><said>“Good-bye. Thank you, oh, thank you. You will come soon. Oh, do come on now.”</said></p>
<p n="878">Rachel found her accompaniment the least satisfactory part of the affair, and resolved on an hour’s practice every day in Mr. Clare’s absence, a wholesome purpose even as regarded her health and spirits. She had just sat down to write letters, feeling for the first time as if they would not be a toil, when Mr. Clare looked in to ask Alick to refer to a verse in the Psalms, quoting it in Greek as well as English, and after the research had been carried to the Hebrew, he told Rachel that he was going to write his sermon, and repaired to the peacock path, where he paced along with Ranger and the cat, in faithful, unobtrusive attendance.</p>
<p n="879"><said>“My dear, the Major will see about your ponies when he comes.”</said></p>
<p n="880"><said>“If there is anything like a promise, I suppose it must be done, but I do not believe there is. I trust to you, Grace, you know I have nothing to waste.”</said></p>
<p n="881"><said>“I hope to induce him to take her into favour.”</said></p>
<p n="882"><said>“Ah! I never said I could do it. I could not tell him I did not care for him, and short of that nothing would stop it,”</said> sobbed Rachel, <said>“only I wished to feel it was not very mean—very wrong.”</said> She laid her weary head on Ermine’s lap, and Ermine bent down and kissed her.</p>
<p n="883"><said>“Poor Mr. Spicer, he reckoned on you to take it; indeed, he thought you had promised him.”</said></p>
<p n="884">Rachel was much disappointed. To be in and out constantly, daily teaching and watching the girls, and encouraging them by learning the employment herself, had been an essential portion of her vision. She had even in one of her most generous moods proposed to share the delight with the Williamses, and asked Ermine if she would not, if all things suited, become the resident matron. However, Mr. Mauleverer said that there was an individual of humbler rank, the widow of a National Schoolmaster, so anxious to devote herself to the work, that he had promised she should share it whenever he was in a condition to set the asylum on foot; and he assured Rachel that she would find this person perfectly amenable to all her views, and ready to work under her. He brought letters in high praise of the late school master, and recommendations of his widow from the clergyman of the parish where they had lived; and place and name being both in the “Clergy List,” even Ermine and Alison began to feel ashamed of their incredulity, whilst as to Grace, she had surrendered herself completely to the eager delight of finding a happy home for the little children in whom she was interested. Grace might laugh a little at Rachel, but in the main her trust in her sister’s superiority always led her judgment, and in the absence of Colonel Keith, Fanny was equally willing to let Rachel think for her when her own children were not concerned.</p>
<p n="885"><said>“I thought he was at Rio,”</said> said Alick.</p>
<p n="886"><said>“Yes, delightful. I told you it was just what would suit you,”</said> added Fanny, to the colonel.</p>
<p n="887"><said>“Yes, one is apt—,”</said> faltered Rachel, decidedly out of countenance.</p>
<p n="888"><said>“You have a shocking habit of driving one up into corners, Alick, but it shall be purely, purely for my own selfish delight,”</said> and she clasped her hands in so droll an affectation of remorse, that the muscles round his eyes quivered with diversion, though the hair on his lip veiled what the corners of his mouth were about; <said>“if only,”</said> she proceeded, <said>“you won’t let it banish you. You must come over to take care of this wicked little sister, or who knows what may be the consequences.”</said></p>
<p n="889"><said>“And I am afraid she is gone to talk Alick to death! I wonder when Alick will come home,”</said> she proceeded, as they entered on the path. <said>“She says Colonel Keith had a telegram about the result of the trial, but she does not know what it was, nor indeed who was tried.”</said></p>
<p n="890"><said>“You can’t tell! You are contented with that sort of home peaceful sunshine that I know suffices many. Even intellectual as you are, you can’t tell what it is to feel power within, to strain at the leash, and see others in the race.”</said></p>
<p n="891"><said>“I can well believe it,”</said> said Rachel; <said>“even some of the most superior persons refuse to lay their hands to any task unless they are certified of the religious opinions of their coadjutors, which seems to me like a mason’s refusing to work at a wall with a man who liked Greek architecture when he preferred Gothic!”</said></p>
<p n="892"><said>“That is contrary to the usual destiny of strong-minded women,”</said> said Bessie.</p>
<p n="893"><said>“Yes, but I should not know him. I had only seen him once, remember, twelve years ago, and when I durst not look at him.”</said></p>
<p n="894"><said>“I like to hear him tell me about the soldiers’ children, and what he wants to have done for them.”</said></p>
<p n="895">She was the same Bessie as ever—full of exulting animation, joined to a caressing manner that her uncle evidently delighted in; and to Rachel she was most kind and sisterly, welcoming her so as amply to please and gratify Alick. An arrangement was made that Rachel should be sent for early to spend the day at Timber End, and that Mr. Clare and Alick should walk over later. Then the two pretty ponies came with her little low carriage to the yew-tree gate, were felt and admired by Mr. Clare, and approved by Alick, and she drove off gaily, leaving all pleased and amused, but still there was a sense that the perfect serenity had been ruffled.</p>
<p n="896"><said>“Perhaps the bearings of the question would hardly suit mixed company.”</said></p>
<p n="897"><said>“How will that be?”</said> asked Fanny, anxiously.</p>
<p n="898"><said>“Oh, I forgot all about the water-colour; but never mind what we give, mamma, it is all to go to an asylum for educating poor girls, and giving them some resource beyond that weary lace-making—the very thing I have always longed for. He is coming to settle it all with me to-morrow, and then we will arrange what to give.”</said></p>
<p n="899"><said>“Perhaps,”</said> said Ermine, with a shade of mimicry in her voice, <said>“when Lady Temple is married to the Colonel. There now, I have gone and told you! I did try to resolve I would not.”</said></p>
<p n="900">He smiled. <said>“I thought yours a more confidence-winning face, Ermine.”</said></p>
<p n="901"><said>“I believe I am wanted to keep Master Alick in order, but if you have the least feeling that you would be more at ease with me at home—”</said></p>
<p n="902">Lord Keith growled something about minding his own concerns.</p>
<p n="903">Presently a horse’s feet were heard on the road before them; there was a meeting and a halt, and Alick Keith’s voice called out—<said>“How has it gone?”</said></p>
<p n="904"><said>“Does he know that?”</said></p>
<p n="905"><said>“I thought myself on my way there,”</said> he said, smiling; <said>“only I had first to settle Lady Temple, little guessing who was her treasure of a governess! Last night I had nearly opened, on another False scent; I fell in with a description that I could have sworn was yours, of the heather behind the parsonage. I made a note of the publisher in case all else had failed.”</said></p>
<p n="906"><said>“Do you know her, Grace?”</said> asked Fanny.</p>
<p n="907"><said>“Then you do not intend to go on teaching?”</said></p>
<p n="908"><said>“The higher style of clergyman does not govern by curatocult. I hope this one may be of that description, as he comes through Mr. Clare. I wonder if this poor man will return?”</said></p>
<p n="909">The continued clang of the bell warned her. She looked round at the still uncleared room, poor Bessie’s rings and bracelets lying mingled with her own on the toilet table, and her little clock, Bessie’s own gift, standing ticking on as it had done at her peaceful rising only yesterday morning.</p>
<p n="910"><said>“No, I want nothing, now I have found you. Where is your uncle?”</said></p>
<p n="911">Her smile awoke a responsive look, and she began to gaze round and admire, feeling it safest to skim on the surface; and he could not but be gratified by her appreciation of the pains spent upon this, her especial home. He had recovered himself again by the time these few sentences had passed; they discussed the few needful arrangements required by his departure, and Tibbie presently found them so cheerful that she was quite scandalized, and when Ermine held out her hands, saying, <said>“What Tibbie, won’t you come and kiss me, and wish me joy?”</said><said> she exclaimed—</said></p>
<p n="912"><said>“Miss Williams!”</said> said Mrs. Curtis. <said>“Yes, she might suit you very well. I believe they are very respectable young women, poor things! I have always wished that we could do more for them.”</said></p>
<p n="913"><said>“Yes, but dear Alick is so full of consideration,”</said> said the sister, eagerly. <said>“He does not get half the credit for it that he deserves, because, you know, he is so quiet and reserved, and has that unlucky ironical way with him that people don’t like; especially rattlepates like those,”</said> pointing with her whip in the direction of the two young officers.</p>
<p n="914">He had no answer, for Fanny was in her aunt’s arms; and, like mother and daughter, they clung to each other—more able to sympathize, more truly one together, than the young widow could be with either of the girls.</p>
<p n="915"><said>“I don’t think they will come. It was only just to call, and they have known me so long. It is all out of respect to my father and Sir Stephen,”</said> said Fanny, meekly as ever. <said>“Indeed, I would not for the world do anything you did not like, dear aunt; but there can’t be any objection to my having Mrs. Hammond and the children to spend the day to-morrow.”</said></p>
<p n="916">“They have been returned about an hour, and I must try to give you Edward’s account of his interview. Maddox has quite dropped his mask, and seems to have been really touched by being brought into contact with Edward again, and, now it is all up with him, seemed to take a kind of pleasure in explaining the whole web, almost, Edward said, with vanity at his own ingenuity. His earlier history was as he used to represent it to Edward. He was a respectable ironmonger’s son, with a taste for art; he was not allowed to indulge it, and then came rebellion, and breaking away from home. He studied at the Academy for a few years, but wanted application, and fancied he had begun too late, tried many things and spent a shifty life, but never was consciously dishonest till after he had fallen in with Edward; and the large sums left uninquired for in his hands became a temptation to one already inclined to gambling. His own difficulties drove him on, and before he ventured on the grand stroke, he had been in a course of using the sums in his hands for his own purposes. The finding poor Maria open to the admiration he gave her beauty, put it into his head to make a tool of her; and this was not the first time he had used Edward’s seal, or imitated his writing. No wonder there was such a confusion in the accounts as told so much against Edward. He told the particulars, Edward says, with the strangest mixture of remorse and exultation. At last came the journey to Bohemia, and his frauds became the more easy, until he saw there must be a bankruptcy, and made the last bold stroke, investing the money abroad in his own name, so that he would have been ready to escape if Edward had come home again. He never expected but that Edward would have returned, and finding the affairs hopeless, did this deed in order to have a resource. As to regret, he seemed to feel some when he said the effects had gone farther than he anticipated; but ‘I could not let him get into that subject,’ Edward said, and he soon came back to his amused complacency in his complete hoodwinking of all concerned at home, almost thanking Edward for the facilities his absence had given him. After this, he went abroad, taking Maria lest she should betray him on being cast off; and they lived in such style at German gambling places that destitution brought them back again to England, where he could better play the lecturer, and the artist in search of subscriptions. Edward could not help smiling over some of his good stories, rather as ‘the lord’ may have ‘commended the wisdom of his unjust steward.’ Well, here he came, and, as he said, he really could hardly have helped himself; he had only to stand still and let poor Rachel deceive herself, and the whole concern was in a manner thrust upon him. He was always expecting to be able to get the main sum into his hands, as he obtained more confidence from Rachel, and the woodcuts were an over-bold stroke for the purpose; he had not intended her to keep or show them, but her ready credulity tempted him too far; and I cannot help laughing now at poor Edward’s reproofs to us for having been all so easily cheated, now that he has been admitted behind the scenes. Maddox never suspected our neighbourhood, he had imagined us to be still in London, and though he heard Alison’s name, he did not connect it with us. After all, what you thought would have been fatal to your hopes of tracing him, was really what gave him into our hands—Lady Temple’s sudden descent upon their F. U. E. E. If he had not been so hurried and distressed as to be forced to leave Maria and the poor child to her fate, Maria would have held by him to the last and without her testimony where should we have been? But with a summons out against him, and hearing that Maria had been recognised, he could only fly to the place at Bristol that he thought unknown to Maria. Even when seized by the police, he did not know it was she who directed them, and had not expected her evidence till he actually saw and heard her on the night of the sessions. It was all Colonel Keith’s doing, he said, every other adversary he would have despised, but your array of forces met him at every corner where he hoped to escape, and the dear little Rosie gave him check-mate, like a gallant little knight’s pawn as she is. ‘Who could have guessed that child would have such a confounded memory?’ he said, for Edward had listened with a sort of interest that had made him quite forget that he was Rose’s father, and that this wicked cunning Colonel was working in his cause. So off he goes to penal servitude, and Edward is so much impressed and touched with his sharpness as to predict that he will be the model prisoner before long, if he do not make his escape. As to poor Maria, that was a much more sad meeting, though perhaps less really melancholy, for there can be no doubt that she repents entirely, she speaks of every one as being very good to her, and indeed the old influences only needed revival, they had never quite died out. Even that poor child’s name was given for love of Ailie, and the perception of having been used to bring about her master’s ruin had always preyed upon her, and further embittered her temper. The barbarity seemed like a dream in connexion with her, but, as she told Ailie, when she once began something came over her, and she could not help striking harder. It reminded me of horrible stories of the Hathertons’ usage of animals. Enough of this. I believe the Sisterhood will find a safe shelter for her when her imprisonment is over, and that temptation will not again be put in her way. We should never have trusted her in poor dear Lucy’s household. Rose calls for the letters. Good bye, dearest Colin and conqueror. I know all this will cheer you, for it is your own doing. I can’t stop saying so, it is such a pleasant sound—Your own,</p>
<p n="917"><said>“And you did not know this?”</said></p>
<p n="918"><said>“Excuse me, dear Rachel,”</said> said Fanny, <said>“I will first see about this.”</said></p>
<p n="919"><said>“Alick?”</said> said his sister mournfully, <said>“you have never forgotten or forgiven my girlish bits of neglect after your wound.”</said></p>
<p n="920">And hearing his carriage at the door, he shook hands, and hurried off, Mrs. Curtis observing—</p>
<p n="921"><said>“Do you suppose that is any satisfaction to me?”</said> He walked decidedly away, and entered by the library window, and she stood grieved and wondering whether she had been wrong in pitying, or whether he were too harsh in his indignation. It was a sign that her tone and spirit had recovered, that she did not succumb in judgment, though she felt utterly puzzled and miserable till she recollected how unwell, weary, and unhappy he was, and that every fresh perception of his sister’s errors was like a poisoned arrow to him; and then she felt shocked at having obtruded the subject on him at all, and when she found him leaning back in his chair, spent and worn out, she waited on him in the quietest, gentlest way she could accomplish, and tried to show that she had put the subject entirely aside. However, when they were next alone together, he turned his face away and muttered, <said>“What did that woman say to you?”</said></p>
<p n="922"><said>“Mrs. Grey told me that her children had never done so well with any one,”</said> said Mrs. Curtis. <said>“She wanted to engage Miss Williams permanently, but could not induce her to leave her sister, or even to remove her to London, on account of her health.”</said></p>
<p n="923">Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p n="924"><said>“It does not enter into her composition.”</said></p>
<p n="925"><said>“She is too far gone, poor lassie,”</said> was the answer; <said>“it would be mere cruelty to torment her. You had better go and lie down, Miss Curtis; her mother and I can do all she is like to need.”</said></p>
<p n="926">He rose at once, and followed her to the hall, where he looked prepared to be kind but firm.</p>
<p n="927"><said>“I must say,”</said> returned Alick, in the same grave tone, <said>“that if you wished for the care of an old man, I should have thought my uncle the more agreeable of the two.”</said></p>
<p n="928"><said>“Told what?”</said></p>
<p n="929"><said>“Are you very much tired?”</said></p>
<p n="930"><said>“Wisdom never pledges itself how it will act in hypothetical circumstances,”</said> was the reply.</p>
<p n="931"><said>“It was her last disappointment that you were not sent home on sick leave. Did you get well too fast?”</said></p>
<p n="932"><said>“You don’t appreciate the pleasure of variety! Besides, she really interests me, she is so full of vigorous crudities. I believe all that is unpleasing in her arises from her being considered as the clever woman of the family; having no man nearly connected enough to keep her in check, and living in society that does not fairly meet her. I want you to talk to her, and take her in hand.”</said></p>
<p n="933"><said>“Don’t talk of her,”</said> cried Conrade, flinging himself round; <said>“women have no truth in them.”</said></p>
<p n="934"><said>“Yes, ma’am, we makes lace more than ever we did to home, day and night; and if we don’t she takes the stick.”</said></p>
<p n="935"><said>“No, he was too utterly broken by the loss of his wife to feel anything else. For a long time we heard nothing, and that was the most dreadful time of all! Then he wrote from a little German town, where he was getting his bread as a photographer’s assistant. And since that he has cast about the world, till just now he has some rather interesting employment at the mines in the Oural Mountains, the first thing he has really seemed to like or care for.”</said></p>
<p n="936">She gave up talking in despair, and by the time the young gentlemen had tired themselves into quiescence, and began to eat the provisions, both ladies were glad to be allowed a little silence.</p>
<p n="937"><said>“And then?”</said></p>
<p n="938"><said>“Yes, he was an excellent man of business.”</said></p>
<p n="939"><said>“I—I was afraid of being in the way,”</said> said Rachel, the first time probably that such a fear had ever suggested itself to her, and blushing as Ermine did not blush.</p>
<p n="940">The Beleaguered City, LONGFELLOW.</p>
<p n="941"><said>“You are as right as usual,”</said> was the reply, with his odd little smile; <said>“at least till the 1st of August.”</said></p>
<p n="942">Little Rose looked up to her, saying, <said>“Please, Aunt Ailie, may I speak to her?”</said></p>
<p n="943">There was a ring of gladness in the usually patient voice that struck even Rachel, though she was usually too eager to be observant, but she was still unready with talk for the occasion, and Ermine continued: <said>“We had heard so much of the Major before-hand, that we had a sort of Jupiter-like expectation of the coming man. I am not sure that I shall not go on expecting a mythic major!”</said></p>
<p n="944"><said>“And where was all this growling?”</said></p>
<p n="945"><said>“Oh, what? Tell me, and I would do it at any cost.”</said></p>
<p n="946">Any one who was up to the game might have perceived that the sister was trying to attribute all the brother’s tone of disapprobation to his anxiety lest his wife should have been startled, while both knew as well as possible that there was a deeper ground of annoyance which was implied in Alick’s answer.</p>
<p n="947"><said>“Thank you, oh, thank you!”</said> said Ermine, <said>“but indeed it was better for him to be away.”</said></p>
<p n="948"><said>“So they are, but Martin says there would be very little difficulty in getting a private bill to enable the trustees to apply the sum otherwise for the benefit of the Avonmouth girls.”</said></p>
<p n="949">Cathedral music had been too natural to him for the endurance of an unchoral service, and the prime labour of his life was to work up his choir; but he was musical by education rather than nature, and having begun his career with such mortal offence to the native fiddlers and singers as to impel them into the arms of dissent, he could only supply the loss from the school by his own voice, of which he was not chary, though using it with better will than taste. The staple of his choir were Rachel’s scholars. Her turn had always been for boys, and her class on Sunday mornings and two evenings in the week had long been in operation before the reign of Mr. Touchett. Then two lads, whose paternal fiddles had seceded to the Plymouth Brethren, were suspended from all advantages by the curate, and Rachel was with difficulty withheld from an explosion; but even this was less annoying than the summons at the class-room door every Sunday morning, that, in the midst of her lesson, carried off the chief of her scholars to practise their chants. Moreover, the blame of all imperfect lessons was laid on the “singing for the parson,” and all faults in the singing by the tasks for Miss Rachel; and one night, the excellent Zack excused his failure in geography by saying that Mr. Touchett had thrown away his book, and said that it was no better than sacrilege, omitting, however, to mention that he had been caught studying it under his surplice during the lessons.</p>
<p n="950"><said>“I shall ask the Major not to let Aunt Rachel come here,”</said> observed Hubert, as she departed; it was well it was not before.</p>
<p n="951">Rachel said no more, but when she was gone upstairs Mr. Clare detained his nephew to say, <said>“I beg your pardon, Alick, but you should be quite sure that your wife likes this proposal.”</said></p>
<p n="952"><said>“Oh, Rachel, I know I am weak and silly,”</said> said the gentle young widow, terrified, <said>“but the Major said if I only tried to do my duty by them I should be helped.”</said></p>
<p n="953"><said>“No, not the flowered flimsiness, please,”</said> she said, in the course of her toilette, <said>“let me have the respectable grey silk.”</said> And next she asked for a drawer, whence she chose a little Nuremberg horn brooch for her neck. <said>“I know it is very silly,”</said> she said, <said>“but I can’t quite help it. Only one question, Ailie, that I thought of too late. Did he hear your name?”</said></p>
<p n="954"><said>“Because I could not quite leave off believing the dreadful things Mr. Maddox and Maria said they would do to me if I told.”</said></p>
<p n="955"><said>“He will be committed for trial at the sessions; and, in the meantime, I must see Beauchamp and Dr. Long, and arrange that he should be prosecuted for the forgery, even though he should slip through our fingers at the sessions.”</said></p>
<p n="956"><said>“And,”</said> pursued the young man, coming to something like life as he talked of his uncle, <said>“though he is not quite all that a companion might be, my uncle says there would be no keeping the living without him, and I do not believe there would, unless my uncle would have me instead.”</said></p>
<p n="957"><said>“Only in character,”</said> calmly returned Alick.</p>
<p n="958"><said>“Well, I suppose you can’t help that; you know, my dear, it would never do for him to stay in this house.”</said></p>
<p n="959"><said>“Ah, mother dear, good morning,”</said> as a pleasant placid-looking lady entered, dressed in black, with an air of feeble health, but of comely middle age.</p>
<p n="960"><said>“Or to set off to delude as many equal foo—mistaken people as he can find elsewhere! Eh, Rachel? Don’t you see, it this friend of yours be innocent, a summons will not hurt him, it will only give him the opportunity of clearing himself.”</said></p>
<p n="961"><said>“I want time to think about it. The woman has acted like a fiend, and I have not a word to say for her; but I cannot feel that it is fair, after such long and entire trust of this man, to turn on him suddenly without notice.”</said></p>
<p n="962"><said>“Gentlemen of the Jury,—The case for the prosecution does not sustain the indictment or require me to call on the prisoner for his defence, and it is your duty to find him not guilty. You will observe that we are not trying a civil action, in respect of the large sum which he has received from the young lady, and for which he is still accountable to her; nor by acquitting him are you pronouncing that he has not shown himself a man of very questionable honesty, but only that the evidence will not bring him within the grasp of the criminal law, as guilty of embezzlement under the statute, and this because of the looseness of the arrange ments, that had been implied instead of expressed. It is exceedingly to be regretted that with the best intentions and kindest purposes, want of caution and experience on her part should have enabled the prisoner thus to secure himself from the possibility of a conviction; but there can be no doubt that the evidence before us is such as to leave no alternative but a verdict of not guilty.”</said></p>
<p n="963"><said>“So do I. And when you get the confidence at first hand, you will receive it with a better grace than if you had had a contraband foretaste.”</said></p>
<p n="964"><said>“Yes,”</said> said Alison. <said>“Lady Temple cannot be left to bear this grievous trouble alone, and when the Homestead cannot help her. Yet, Ermine, what can be done? Is it safe for you and Rose?”</said></p>
<p n="965">There they remained so long, that in spite of such encouragement as could be derived from peeping over the blinds at Coombe standing sentinel over his two young masters at the carriage window, Lady Temple began to feel some dismay, though no repentance, and with anxious iteration conjured Miss Williams to guess what could be the cause of delay.</p>
<p n="966"><said>“Not grieve!”</said> he exclaimed, <said>“when I think of the beautiful vigorous being that used to be the life of the place—”</said> and he would have said more but for a deprecating sign of the hand.</p>
<p n="967"><said>“Not in the least,”</said> returned both her companions at once, and she was quite ready to agree with them when the slender form and fair young face met her in the hall amid a cloud of eager boys. The meeting was a full renewal of the parting, warm and fond, and Bessie so comported herself on her introduction to the children, that they all became enamoured of her on the spot, and even Stephana relaxed her shyness on her behalf. That sunny gay good-nature could not be withstood, and Rachel, again sharing Fanny’s first dinner after an arrival, no longer sat apart despising the military atmosphere, but listening, not without amusement, to the account of the humours of the wedding, mingled with Alick Keith’s touches of satire.</p>
<p n="968"><said>“Fanny, how can you be so foolish?—as if I would hurt your boys!”</said></p>
<p n="969"><said>“Then believe me, Alick. May I not love the fine old man that has been so kind to me?”</said></p>
<p n="970">Rachel repaired to her room to cool her glowing cheeks, and repeat to herself, <said>“A mistake, an error. It must be a blunder! That boy that went to the theatre may have cheated them! Mrs. Rawlins may have deceived Mr. Mauleverer. Anything must be True rather than—No, no! such a tissue of deception is impossible in a man of such sentiments! Persecuted as he has been, shall appearances make me—me, his only friend—turn against him? Oh, me! here come the whole posse purring upstairs to take off their things! I shall be invaded in a moment.”</said></p>
<p n="971"><said>“I should be most happy. But who would be the persons concerned?”</said></p>
<p n="972"><said>“Thank you,”</said> said Ermine, with a sweet smile, colouring cheek, yet grave eyes, and much taken by surprise at being seized by both hands, and kissed on each cheek.</p>
<p n="973"><said>“No, Ermine,”</said> with a smile, <said>“that I will never do.”</said></p>
<p n="974"><said>“Exactly,”</said> said Ermine; <said>“every one has given way to her, and, of course, she walks over their bodies, but there is something so noble about her that I cannot but believe that she will one day shake herself clear of her little absurdities.”</said></p>
<p n="975"><said>“Of your sister’s illness? It must have lasted long?”</said></p>
<p n="976">An old friend lived in the neighbourhood who remembered Fanny’s father, and was very anxious to see her again, though not able to leave the house. So the first day that it was fine enough for Mrs. Curtis to venture out, she undertook to convey Fanny to call upon her, and was off with a wonderfully moderate allowance of children, only the two youngest boys outside with their maid. This drive brought more to light about Fanny’s past way of life and feelings than had ever yet appeared. Rachel had never elicited nearly so much as seemed to have come forth spontaneously to the aunt, who had never in old times been Fanny’s confidante.</p>
<p n="977">Mrs. Curtis was tired, and stayed at home; and Grace spent the afternoon in investigations about the harrying of the thrushes, but, alas! without coming a bit nearer the truth. Nothing was seen or heard of Lady Temple till, at half-past nine, one of the midges, or diminutive flies used at Avonmonth, came to the door, and Fanny came into the drawing-room—wan, tearful, agitated.</p>
<p n="978"><said>“I see what you mean,”</said> said Rachel. <said>“Gentleness is not feebleness, nor lowness lowliness. There must be something held back.”</said></p>
<p n="979"><said>“Did you ever see diphtheria?”</said></p>
<p n="980"><said>“My dear,”</said> then said Mr. Grey, taking her by the hand again, and looking into the brown intelligent eyes, <said>“I am sure you have been well taught. Can you tell me what is meant by taking an oath before a magistrate?”</said></p>
<p n="981"><said>“I should punch him,”</said> returned Francis.</p>
<p n="982"><said>“She is not a strong-minded woman, she only has been made to believe herself one,”</said> said Ermine, warmly.</p>
<p n="983"><said>“What! such an infliction?”</said> in his own dry way.</p>
<p n="984"><said>“At any rate you will be so very kind as not to let any one know of it. I am glad you do. I should not feel it right that you should not, but it is different with others.”</said></p>
<p n="985">They were beyond the grounds of the Homestead, but had to go a little further to get into the path, when they paused above a sort of dip or amphitheatre of rock around a little bay, whilst Rachel began telling of the smugglers’ traditions that haunted the place—how much brandy and silk had there been landed in the time of the great French war, and how once, when hard pressed, a party of smugglers, taking a short cut in the moonlight midnight across the Homestead gardens, had encountered an escaped Guinea-pig, and no doubt taking it for the very rat without a tail, in whose person Macbeth’s witch was to do, and to do, and to do, had been nearly scared out of their wits.</p>
<p n="986"><said>“No, I am not so silly now.”</said></p>
<p n="987">And Fanny made no apology, but seemed pleased, ready with answers and with eyes, apparently ignorant that Rachel’s toes were less insensible than her own, and her heavy three-years-old Wilfred asleep on her lap all the time.</p>
<p n="988"><said>“But if you would only tell me how you gained it.”</said></p>
<p n="989"><said>“Just what I do not want you to see. They have found out that the Rectory is unhealthy, and stuck up a new bald house on the top of the hill; and the Hall is new furnished in colours that set one’s teeth on edge. Nothing is like itself but Harry, and he only when you get him off duty—without his wife! I was glad to get away to Belfast.”</said></p>
