<sample><p n="ENG185311160"><said direct="true">'Yes, this one more, mamma,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, and they went off together, while Philip remained, in a reverie, till requested by his aunt to see if the carriage was ready.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311161"><said direct="false">The dance was over, the carriage was waiting, but Guy and Laura did not appear till, after two or three minutes spent in wonder and inquiries, they came quietly walking back from the library, where they had been looking at King Charles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311162"><said direct="false">All the way home the four ladies in their carriage never ceased laughing and talking. The three gentlemen in theirs acted diversely. Mr. Edmonstone went to sleep, Philip sat in silent thought, Guy whistled and hummed the tunes, and moved his foot very much as if he was still dancing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311163"><said direct="false">They met for a moment, and parted again in the hall at Hollywell, where the daylight was striving to get in through the closed shutters. Philip went on to Broadstone, Guy said he could not go to bed by daylight, called Bustle, and went to the river to bathe, and the rest crept up-stairs to their rooms. And so ended Lord Kilcoran's ball.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311164"><said direct="false">Montrose.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311165"><said direct="false">One very hot afternoon, shortly after the ball, Captain Morville walked to Hollywell, accelerating his pace under the influence of anxious reflections.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311166"><said direct="false">He could not determine whether Charles had spoken in jest; but, in spite of Guy's extreme youth, he feared there was ground for the suspicion excited by the hint, and was persuaded that such an attachment could produce nothing but unhappiness to his cousin, considering how little confidence could be placed in Guy. He perceived that there was much to inspire affection —attractive qualities, amiable disposition, the talent for music, and now this recently discovered power of versifying, all were in Guy's favour, besides the ancient name and long ancestry which conferred a romantic interest, and caused even Philip to look up to him with a feudal feeling as head of the family. There was also the familiar intercourse to increase the danger; and Philip, as he reflected on these things, trembled for Laura, and felt himself her only protector; for his uncle was nobody, Mrs. Edmonstone was infatuated, and Charles would not listen to reason. To make everything worse, he had that morning heard that there was to be a grand inspection of the regiment and a presentation of colours; Colonel Deane was very anxious, and it was plain that in the interval the officers would be allowed little leisure. The whole affair was to end with a ball, which would lead to a repetition of what had already disturbed him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311167"><said direct="false">Thus meditating, Philip, heated and dusty, walked into the smooth green enclosure of Hollywell. Everything, save the dancing clouds of insect youth which whirled in his face, was drooping in the heat. The house—every door and window opened—seemed gasping for breath; the cows sought refuge in the shade; the pony drooped its head drowsily; the leaves hung wearily; the flowers were faint and thirsty; and Bustle was stretched on the stone steps, mouth open, tongue out, only his tail now and then moving, till he put back his ears and crested his head to greet the arrival. Philip heard the sounds that had caused the motion of the sympathizing tail,—the rich tones of Guy's voice. Stepping over the dog, he entered, and heard more clearly— 'Two loving hearts may sever, For sorrow fails them never.' And then another voice—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311168"><said direct="false">In the drawing-room, cool and comfortable in the green shade of the Venetian blinds of the bay window, stood Laura, leaning on the piano, close to Guy, who sat on the music-stool, looking thoroughly at home in his brown shooting-coat, and loosely-tied handkerchief.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311169"><said direct="false">Any one but Philip would have been out of temper, but he shook hands as cordially as usual, and would not even be the first to remark on the heat.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311170"><said direct="false">Laura told him he looked hot and tired, and invited him to come out to the others, and cool himself on the lawn. She went for her parasol, Guy ran for her camp stool, and Philip, going to the piano, read what they had been singing. The lines were in Laura's writing, corrected, here and there, in Guy's hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311171"><said direct="false">BE STEADFAST.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311172"><said direct="false">Philip was by no means pleased. However, it was in anything but a sentimental manner that Guy, looking over him, said, 'For sever, read, be separated, but 'a' wouldn't rhyme.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311173"><said direct="true">'I translated it into prose, and Guy made it verse,'</said><said direct="false"> ssid Laura; 'I hope you approve of our performance.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311174"><said direct="true">'It is that thing of Helm von Chezy, Beharre , is it not?'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, particularly civil, because he was so much annoyed. 'You have rendered the spirit very well; but you have sacrificed a good deal to your double rhymes.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311175"><said direct="true">'Yes, those last lines are not troubled with any equality of feet,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy; 'but the repetition is half the beauty. It put me in mind of those lines of Burns— 'Had we never loved so kindly, Had we never loved so blindly, Never met and never parted, We had ne'er been broken hearted;' but there is a trust in these that is more touching than that despair.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311176"><said direct="true">'Yes, the despair is ready to wish the love had never been,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura. 'It does not see the star of trust. Why did you use that word 'trust' only once, Guy?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311177"><said direct="false">'I did not want to lose the three—faith, hope, love, —faith keeping the other two alive.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311178"><said direct="false">'My doubt was whether it was right to have that analogy.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311179"><said direct="true">'Surely,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, eagerly, 'that analogy must be the best part of earthly love?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311180"><said direct="false">Here Charlotte came to see if Guy and Laura meant to sing all the afternoon, and they went out. They found the others in the arbour, and Charlotte's histories of its construction gave Philip little satisfaction. They next proceeded to talk over the ball.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311181"><said direct="true">'Ah!'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, 'balls are the fashion just now. What do you say, Amy, [he was more inclined to patronize her than any one else] to the gaieties we are going to provide for you?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311182"><said direct="false">'You! Are you going to have your new colours? Oh! you are not going to give us a ball?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311183"><said direct="true">'Well! that is fun!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Guy. 'What glory Maurice de Courcy must be in!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311184"><said direct="true">'He is gone to Allonby,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, 'to announce it; saying, he must persuade his father to put off their going to Brighton. Do you think he will succeed?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311185"><said direct="true">'Hardly,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura; 'poor Lady Kilcoran was so knocked up by their ball that she is the more in want of sea air. Oh, mamma! Eva must come and stay here.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311186"><said direct="true">'That she must,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone; 'that will make it easy. She is the only one who will care about the ball.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311187"><said direct="false">Philip was obliged to conceal his vexation, and to answer the many eager questions about the arrangements. He stayed to dinner, and as the others went indoors to dress, he lingered near Charlotte, assuming, with some difficulty, an air of indifference, and said,— 'Well, Charlotte, did you tease Guy into showing you those verses?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311188"><said direct="true">'O yes,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte, with what the French call un air capable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311189"><said direct="false">'Well, what were they?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311190"><said direct="true">'That I mustn'</said><said direct="false">t tell. They were very pretty; but I've promised.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311191"><said direct="false">'Promised what?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311192"><said direct="false">'Never to say anything about them. He made it a condition with me, and I assure you I am to be trusted.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311193"><said direct="true">'Right,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip; 'I'll ask no more.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311194"><said direct="true">'It would be of no use,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte, shaking her head, as if she wished he would prove her further.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311195"><said direct="false">Philip was in hopes of being able to speak to Laura after dinner, but his uncle wanted him to come and look over the plans of an estate adjoining Redclyffe, which there was some idea of purchasing. Such an employment would in general have been congenial, but on this occasion it was only by a strong force that he could chain his attention, for Guy was pacing the terrace with Laura and Amabel, and as they passed and repassed the window, he now and then caught sounds of repeating poetry.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311196"><said direct="false">In this Guy excelled. He did not read aloud well; he was too rapid, and eyes and thoughts were apt to travel still faster than the lips, thus producing confusion; but no one could recite better when a passage had taken strong hold of his imagination, and he gave it the full effect of the modulations of his fine voice, conveying in its inflections the impressions which stirred him profoundly. He was just now enchanted with his first reading of 'Thalaba,' where he found all manner of deep meanings, to which the sisters listened with wonder and delight. He repeated, in a low, awful, thrilling tone, that made Amy shudder, the lines in the seventh book ending with—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311197"><said direct="true">'You have not been so taken up with any book since Sintram,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311198"><said direct="true">'It is like Sintram,'</said><said direct="false"> he replied.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311199"><said direct="false">'Like it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311200"><said direct="false">'So it seems to me. A strife with the powers of darkness; the victory, forgiveness, resignation, death.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311201"><said direct="true">'I wish you would not speak as if you were Thalaba yourself,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy; 'you bring the whole Domdaniel round us.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311202"><said direct="true">'I am afraid he is going to believe himself Thalaba as well as Sintram,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura. 'But you know Southey did not see all this himself, and did not understand it when it was pointed out.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311203"><said direct="true">'Don'</said><said direct="false">t tell us that,' said Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311204"><said direct="true">'Nay, I think there is something striking in it,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy; then, with a sudden transition, 'but is not this ball famous?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311205"><said direct="false">And their talk was of balls and reviews till nine o'clock, when they were summoned to tea.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311206"><said direct="false">On the whole, Philip returned to Broadstone by no means comforted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311207"><said direct="false">Never had he known so much difficulty in attending with patience to his duties as in the course of the next fortnight. They became a greater durance, as he at length looked his feelings full in the face, and became aware of their true nature.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311208"><said direct="false">He perceived that the loss of Laura would darken his whole existence; yet he thought that, were he only secure of her happiness, he could have resigned her in silence. Guy was, however, one of the last men in the world whom he could bear to see in possession of her; and probably she was allowing herself to be entangled, if not in heart, at least in manner. If so, she should not be unwarned. He had been her guide from childhood, and he would not fail her now.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311209"><said direct="false">Three days before the review, he succeeded in finding time for a walk to Hollywell, not fully decided on the part he should act, though resolved on making some remonstrance. He was crossing a stile, about a mile and a half from Hollywell, when he saw a lady sitting on the stump of a tree, sketching, and found that fate had been so propitious as to send Laura thither alone. The rest had gone to gather mushrooms on a down, and had left her sketching the view of the spires of Broadstone, in the cleft between the high green hills. She was very glad to see him, and held up her purple and olive washes to be criticized; but he did not pay much attention to them. He was almost confused at the sudden manner in which the opportunity for speaking had presented itself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311210"><said direct="true">'It is a long time since I have seen you,'</said><said direct="false"> said he, at last.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311211"><said direct="false">'An unheard-of time.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311212"><said direct="false">'Still longer since we have had any conversation.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311213"><said direct="false">'I was just thinking so. Not since that hot haymaking, when Guy came home. Indeed, we have had so much amusement lately that I have hardly had time for thought. Guy says we are all growing dissipated.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311214"><said direct="false">'Ah! your German, and dancing, and music, do not agree with thought.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311215"><said direct="true">'Poor music!'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, smiling. 'But I am ready for a lecture; I have been feeling more like a butterfly than I like.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311216"><said direct="false">'I know you think me unjust about music, and I freely confess that I cannot estimate the pleasure it affords, but I doubt whether it is a safe pleasure. It forms common ground for persons who would otherwise have little in common, and leads to intimacies which occasion results never looked for.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311217"><said direct="true">'Yes,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, receiving it as a general maxim.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311218"><said direct="false">'Laura, you complain of feeling like a butterfly. Is not that a sign that you were made for better things?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311219"><said direct="true">'But what can I do? I try to read early and at night, but I can'</said><said direct="false">t prevent the fun and gaiety, and indeed I don't think I would. It is innocent, and we never had such a pleasant summer. Charlie is so—so much more equable, and mamma is more easy about him, and I can't help thinking it does them all good, though I do feel idle.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311220"><said direct="true">'It is innocent, it is right for a little while,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip; 'but your dissatisfaction proves that you are superior to such things. Laura, what I fear is, that this summer holiday may entangle you, and so fix your fate as to render your life no holiday. O Laura! take care; know what you are doing!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311221"><said direct="true">'What am I doing?'</said><said direct="false"> asked Laura, with an alarmed look of ingenuous surprise.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311222"><said direct="false">Never had it been so hard to maintain his composure as now, when her simplicity forced him to come to plainer terms. 'I must speak,' he continued, 'because no one else will. Have you reflected whither this may tend? This music, this versifying, this admitting a stranger so unreservedly into your pursuits?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311223"><said direct="false">She understood now, and hung her head. He would have given worlds to judge of the face hidden by her bonnet, but as she did not reply, he spoke on, his agitation becoming so strong, that the struggle was perceptible in the forced calmness of his tone. 'I would not say a word if he were worthy, but Laura—Laura, I have seen Locksley Hall acted once; do not let me see it again in a way which—which would give me infinitely more pain.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311224"><said direct="false">The faltering of his voice, so resolutely subdued, touched her extremely, and a thrill of exquisite pleasure glanced through her, on hearing confirmed what she had long felt, that she had taken Margaret's place— nay, as she now learnt, that she was even more precious to him. She only thought of reassuring him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311225"><said direct="true">'No; you need never fear that . He has no such thought, I am sure.'</said><said direct="false"> She blushed deeply, but looked in his face. 'He treats us both alike; besides, he is so young.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311226"><said direct="true">'The mischief is not done,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, trying to resume his usual tone; 'I only meant to speak in time. You might let your manner go too far, you might even allow your affections to be involved without knowing it, if you were not on your guard.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311227"><said direct="true">'Never!'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura. 'Oh, no; I could never dream of that with Guy. I like Guy very much; I think better of him than you do; but oh, no; he could never be my first and best; I could never care for him in that way. How could you think so, Philip?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311228"><said direct="true">'Laura, I cannot but look on you with what may seem over-solicitude. Since I lost Fanny, and worse than lost Margaret, you have been my home; my first, my most precious interest. O, Laura,'</said><said direct="false"> and he did not even attempt to conceal the trembling and tenderness of his voice, 'could I bear to lose you, to see you thrown away or changed—you, dearest, best of all?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311229"><said direct="false">Laura did not turn away her head this time, but raising her beautiful face, glowing with such a look as had never beamed there before, while tears rose to her eyes, she said, 'Don't speak of my changing towards you. I never could; for if there is anything to care for in me, it is you that have taught it to me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311230"><said direct="false">If ever face plainly told another that he was her first and best, Laura's did so now. Away went misgivings, and he looked at her in happiness too great for speech; at least, he could not speak till he had mastered his emotion, but his countenance was sufficient reply. Even then, in the midst of this flood of ecstasy, came the thought, 'What have I done?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311231"><said direct="false">He had gone further than he had ever intended. It was a positive avowal of love; and what would ensue? Cessation of intercourse with her, endless vexations, the displeasure of her family, loss of influence, contempt, and from Mr. Edmonstone, for the pretensions of a penniless soldier. His joy was too great to be damped, but it was rendered cautious. 'Laura, my own! (what delight the words gave her,) you have made me very happy. We know each other now, and trust each other for ever.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311232"><said direct="false">'O yes, yes; nothing can alter what has grown up with us.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311233"><said direct="true">'It is for ever!'</said><said direct="false"> repeated Philip. 'But, Laura, let us be content with our own knowledge of what we are to each other. Do not let us call in others to see our happiness.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311234"><said direct="false">Laura looked surprised, for she always considered any communication about his private feelings too sacred to be repeated, and wondered he should think the injunction necessary. 'I never can bear to talk about the best kinds of happiness,' said she; 'but oh!' and she sprang up, 'here they come.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311235"><said direct="false">Poor Mrs. Edmonstone, as she walked back from her mushroom-field, she little guessed that words had been spoken which would give the colouring to her daughter's whole life—she little guessed that her much-loved and esteemed nephew had betrayed her confidence!</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311236"><said direct="false">As she and the girls came up, Philip advanced to meet them, that Laura might have a few moments to recover, while with an effort he kept himself from appearing absent in the conversation that ensued. It was brief, for having answered some questions with regard to the doings on the important day, he said, that since he had met them he would not come on to Hollywell, and bade them farewell, giving Laura a pressure of the hand which renewed the glow on her face.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311237"><said direct="false">He walked back, trying to look through the dazzling haze of joy so as to see his situation clearly. It was impossible for him not to perceive that there had been an absolute declaration of affection, and that he had established a private understanding with his cousin. It was not, however, an engagement, nor did he at present desire to make it so. It was impossible for him as yet to marry, and he was content to wait without a promise, since that could not add to his entire reliance on Laura. He could not bear to be rejected by her parents; he knew his poverty would be the sole ground of objection, and he was not asking her to share it. He believed sincerely that a long lingering attachment to himself would be more for her good than a marriage with one who would have been a high prize for worldly aims, and was satisfied that by winning her heart he had taken the only sure means of securing her from becoming attached to Guy, while secrecy was the only way of preserving his intercourse with her on the same footing, and exerting his influence over the family.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311238"><said direct="false">It was calmly reflected, for Philip's love was tranquil, though deep and steady, and he rather sought to preserve Laura as she was than to make her anything more; and this very calmness contributed to his self-deception on this first occasion that he had ever actually swerved from the path of right.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311239"><said direct="false">With an uncomfortable sensation, he met Guy riding home from his tutor, entirely unsuspicious. He stopped and talked of the preparations at Broadstone, where he had been over the ground with Maurice de Courcy, and had heard the band.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311240"><said direct="true">'What did you think of it?'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, absently.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311241"><said direct="true">'They should keep better time! Really, Philip, there is one fellow with a bugle that ought to be flogged every day of his life!'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, making a droll, excruciated face.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311242"><said direct="false">How a few words can change the whole current of ideas! The band was connected with Philip, therefore he could not bear to hear it found fault with, and adduced some one's opinion that the man in question was one of the best of their musicians.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311243"><said direct="false">Guy could not help shrugging his shoulders, as he laughed, and said,—'Then I shall be obliged to take to my heels if I meet the rest. Good bye.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311244"><said direct="true">'How conceited they have made that boy about his fine ear,'</said><said direct="false"> thought Philip. 'I wonder he is not ashamed to parade his music, considering whence it is derived.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311245"><said direct="false">Scott.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311246"><said direct="false">How was it meantime with Laura? The others were laughing and talking round her, but all seemed lost in the transcendent beam that had shone out on her. To be told by Philip that she was all to him that he had always been to her! This one idea pervaded her—too glorious, too happy for utterance, almost for distinct thought. The softening of his voice and the look with which he had regarded her, recurred again and again, startling her with a sudden surprise of joy almost as at the first moment. Of the future Laura thought not. Never had a promise of love been made with less knowledge of what it amounted to; it seemed merely an expression of sentiments that she had never been without; for had she not always looked up to Philip more than any other living creature, and gloried in being his favourite cousin? Ever since the time when he explained to her the plates in the Encyclopaedia, and made her read 'Joyce's Scientific Dialogues,' when Amy took fright at the first page. That this might lead further did not occur to her; she was eighteen; she had no experience, not even in novels; she did not know what she had done; and, above all, she had so learnt to surrender her opinions to Philip, and to believe him always right, that she would never have dreamt of questioning wherever he might choose to lead her. Even the caution of secrecy did not alarm her, though she wondered that he thought it required, safe as his confidence always was with her. Mrs. Edmonstone had been so much occupied by Charles's illness, as to have been unable to attend to her daughters in their girlish days; and in the governess's time the habit had been disused of flying at once to her with every joy or grief. Laura's thoughts were not easy of access, and Philip had long been all in all to her. She was too ignorant of life to perceive that it was her duty to make this conversation known; or, more truly, she did not awaken her mind to consider that anything could be wrong that Philip desired.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311247"><said direct="false">On coming home, she ran up to her own room, and, sitting by the open window, gave herself up to that delicious dream of new-found joy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311248"><said direct="false">There she still sat when Amy came in, opening the door softly, and treading lightly and airily as she entered, bringing two or three roses of different tints.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311249"><said direct="false">'Laura! not begun to dress?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311250"><said direct="false">'Is it time?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311251"><said direct="false">'Shall I answer you according to what Philip calls my note of time, and tell you the pimpernels are closed, and the tigridias dropping their leaves? It would be a proper answer for you; you look as if you were in Fairy Land.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311252"><said direct="false">'Is papa come home?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311253"><said direct="false">'Long ago! and Guy too. Why, where could you have been, not to have heard Guy and Eveleen singing the Irish melodies?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311254"><said direct="true">'In a trance,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, starting up, and laughing with a slight degree of constraint, which caused Amy, who was helping her to dress, to exclaim, 'Has anything happened, Laura?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311255"><said direct="false">'What should have happened?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311256"><said direct="true">'I can'</said><said direct="false">t guess, unless the fairies in the great ring on Ashen-down came to visit you when we were gone. But seriously, dear Laura, are you sure you are not tired? Is nothing the matter?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311257"><said direct="false">'Nothing at all, thank you. I was only thinking over the talk I had with Philip.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311258"><said direct="false">'Oh!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311259"><said direct="false">Amy never thought of entering into Philip's talks with Laura, and was perfectly satisfied.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311260"><said direct="false">By this time Laura was herself again, come back to common life, and resolved to watch over her intercourse with Guy; since, though she was convinced that all was safe at present, she had Philip's word for it that there might be danger in continuing the pleasant freedom of their behaviour.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311261"><said direct="false">Nothing could be more reassuring than Guy's demeanour. His head seemed entirely full of the Thursday, and of a plan of his own for enabling Charles to go to the review. It had darted into his head while he was going over the ground with Maurice. It was so long since Charles had thought it possible to attempt any amusement away from home, and former experiments had been so unsuccessful, that it had never even occurred to him to think of it; but he caught at the idea with great delight and eagerness. Mrs. Edmonstone seemed not to know what to say; she had much rather that it had not been proposed; yet it was very kind of Guy, and Charles was so anxious about it that she knew not how to oppose him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311262"><said direct="false">She could not bear to have Charles in a crowd, helpless as he was; and she had an unpleasing remembrance of the last occasion when they had taken him to a flower-show, where they had lost, first Mr. Edmonstone, next the carriage, and lastly, Amy and Charlotte—all had been frightened, and Charles laid up for three days from the fatigue.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311263"><said direct="false">Answers, however, met each objection. Charles was much stronger; Guy's arm would be ready for him; Guy would find the carriage. Philip would be there to help, besides Maurice; and whenever Charles was tired, Guy would take him home at once, without spoiling any one's pleasure.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311264"><said direct="true">'Except your own,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311265"><said direct="false">'Thank you; but this would be so delightful.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311266"><said direct="true">'Ah!'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, 'it would be as great a triumph as the dog's that caught the hare with the clog round his neck—the dog's, I mean.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311267"><said direct="true">'If you will but trust me with him,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, turning on her all the pleading eloquence of his eyes; 'you know he can get in and out of the pony-carriage quite easily.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311268"><said direct="true">'As well as walk across the room,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311269"><said direct="false">'I would drive him in it, and tell William to ride in, and be at hand to hold the pony or take it out; and the tent is so near, that you could get to the breakfast, unless the review had been enough for you. I paced the distance to make sure, and it is no further than from the garden-door to the cherry-tree.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311270"><said direct="true">'That is nothing,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311271"><said direct="false">'And William shall be in waiting to bring the pony the instant you are ready, and we can go home independently of every one else.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311272"><said direct="true">'I thought,'</said><said direct="false"> interposed Mrs. Edmonstone, 'that you were to go to the mess-dinner—what is to become of that?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311273"><said direct="true">'O,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, 'that will be simply a bore, and he may rejoice to be excused from going the whole hog.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311274"><said direct="false">'To be sure, I had rather dine in peace at home.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311275"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone was not happy, but she had great confidence in Guy; and her only real scruple was, that she did not think it fair to occupy him entirely with attendance on her son. She referred it to papa, which, as every one knew, was the same as yielding the point, and consoled herself by the certainty that to prevent it would be a great disappointment to both the youths. Laura was convinced that to achieve the adventure of Charles at the review, was at present at least a matter of far more prominence with Guy than anything relating to herself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311276"><said direct="false">All but Laura and her mother were wild about the weather, especially on Wednesday, when there was an attempt at a thunder storm. Nothing was studied but the sky; and the conversation consisted of prognostications, reports of rises and falls of the glass, of the way weather-cocks were turning, or about to turn, of swallows flying high or low, red sunsets, and halos round the moon, until at last Guy, bursting into a merry laugh, begged Mrs. Edmonstone's pardon for being such a nuisance, and made a vow, and kept it, that be the weather what it might, he would say not another word about it that evening; it deserved to be neglected, for he had not been able to settle to anything all day.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311277"><said direct="false">He might have said for many days before; for since the last ball, and still more since Lady Eveleen had been at Hollywell, it had been one round of merriment and amusement. Scrambling walks, tea-drinkings out of doors, dances among themselves, or with the addition of the Harpers, were the order of the day. Amy, Eveleen, and Guy, could hardly come into the room without dancing, and the piano was said to acknowledge nothing but waltzes, polkas, and now and then an Irish jig, for the special benefit of Mr. Edmonstone's ears. The morning was almost as much spent in mirth as the afternoon, for the dawdlings after breakfast, and before luncheon, had a great tendency to spread out and meet; there was new music and singing to be practised, or preparations made for evening's diversion, or councils to be held, which Laura's absence could not break up, though it often made Amy feel how much less idle and frivolous Laura was than herself. Eveleen said the same, but she was visiting, and it was a time to be idle; and Mr. Lascelles seemed to be of the same opinion with regard to his pupil; for, when Guy was vexed at not having done as much work as usual, he only laughed at him for expecting to be able to go to balls, and spend a summer of gaiety, while he studied as much as at Oxford.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311278"><said direct="false">Thursday morning was all that heart could wish, the air cooled by the thunder, and the clouds looking as if raining was foreign to their nature. Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, their daughters, and Lady Eveleen, were packed inside and outside the great carriage, while Guy, carefully settling Charles in the low phaeton, putting in all that any one recommended, from an air-cushion to an umbrella, flourished his whip, and drove off with an air of exultation and delight.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311279"><said direct="false">Everything went off to admiration. No one was more amused than Charles. The scene was so perfectly new and delightful to one accustomed to such a monotonous life, that the very sight of people was a novelty. Nowhere was there so much laughing and talking as in that little carriage, and whenever Mrs. Edmonstone's anxious eyes fell upon it, she always saw Charles sitting upright with a face so full of eager interest as to banish all thought of fatigue. Happy, indeed, he was. He enjoyed the surprise of his acquaintance at meeting him; he enjoyed Dr. Mayerne's laugh and congratulation; he enjoyed seeing how foolish Philip thought him, nodding to his mother and sisters, laughing at the dreadful faces Guy could not help making at any particularly discordant note of the offensive bugle; and his capabilities rising with his spirits, he did all that the others did, walked further than he had done for years, was lifted up steps without knowing how, sat out the whole breakfast, talked to all the world, and well earned the being thoroughly tired, as he certainly was, when Guy put him into the carriage and drove him home, and still more so when Guy all but carried him up stairs, and laid him on the sofa in the dressing-room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311280"><said direct="false">However, his mother announced that it would have been so unnatural if he had not been fatigued, that she should have been more anxious, and, leaving him to repose, they all, except Mr. Edmonstone, who had stayed to dine at the mess, sat down to dinner.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311281"><said direct="false">Amy came down dressed just as the carriage had been announced, and found Laura and Eveleen standing by the table, arranging their bouquets, while Guy, in the dark, behind the piano, was playing—not, as usual in such cases, the Harmonious Blacksmith, but a chant.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311282"><said direct="true">'Is mamma ready?'</said><said direct="false"> asked Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311283"><said direct="true">'Nearly,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy; 'but I wish she was not obliged to go! I am sure she cannot bear to leave Charlie.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311284"><said direct="true">'I hope she is not going on my account,'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311285"><said direct="true">'No,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, 'we must go; it would so frighten papa if we did not come. Besides, there is nothing to be uneasy about with Charles.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311286"><said direct="true">'O, no,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy; 'she says so, only she is always anxious, and she is afraid he is too restless to go to sleep.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311287"><said direct="true">'We must get home as fast as we can; if you don'</said><said direct="false">t mind, Eva,' said Laura, remembering how her last dance with Guy had delayed them.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311288"><said direct="true">'Can I do any good to Charlie?'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, ceasing his music. 'I don't mean to go.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311289"><said direct="true">'Not go!'</said><said direct="false"> cried the girls in consternation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311290"><said direct="true">'He is joking!'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen. 'But, I declare!' added she, advancing towards him, 'he is not dressed! Come, nonsense, this is carrying it too far; you'll make us all too late, and then I'll set Maurice at you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311291"><said direct="true">'I am afraid it is no joke,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, smiling.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311292"><said direct="true">'You must go. It will never do for you to stay away,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, decidedly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311293"><said direct="true">'Are you tired? Aren'</said><said direct="false">t you well?' asked Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311294"><said direct="false">'Quite well, thank you, but I am sure I had better not.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311295"><said direct="false">Laura thought she had better not seem anxious to take him, so she left the task of persuasion to the others, and Amy went on.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311296"><said direct="false">'Neither mamma nor Charlie could bear to think you stayed because of him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311297"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t, I assure you, Amy; I meant it before. I have been gradually finding out that it must come to this.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311298"><said direct="true">'Oh, you think it a matter of right and wrong! But you don'</said><said direct="false">t think balls wrong?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311299"><said direct="false">'Oh, no; only they wont do for such an absurd person as I am. The last turned my head for a week, and I am much too unsteady for this.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311300"><said direct="true">'Well, if you think it a matter of duty, it can'</said><said direct="false">t be helped,' said Amy, sorrowfully; 'but I am very sorry.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311301"><said direct="true">'Thank you,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, thinking it compassion, not regret; 'but I shall do very well. I shall be all the happier to-morrow for a quiet hour at my Greek, and you'll tell me all the fun.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311302"><said direct="true">'You liked it so much!'</said><said direct="false"> sighed Amy; 'but you have made up your mind, and I ought not to tease you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311303"><said direct="true">'That'</said><said direct="false">s right, Amy; he does it on purpose to be teased,' said Eveleen, 'and I never knew anybody so provoking. Mind, Sir Guy, if you make us all too late, you sha'n't have the ghost of a quadrille with me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311304"><said direct="true">'I shall console myself by quadrilling with Andromache,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311305"><said direct="false">'Come, no nonsense—off to dress directly! How can you have the conscience to stand there when the carriage is at the door?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311306"><said direct="false">'I shall have great pleasure in handing you in when you are ready.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311307"><said direct="false">'Laura—Amy! Does he really mean it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311308"><said direct="true">'I am afraid he does,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311309"><said direct="false">Eveleen let herself fall on the sofa as if fainting. 'Oh!' she said; 'take him away! Let me never see the face of him again! I'm perfectly overcome! All my teaching thrown away!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311310"><said direct="true">'I am sorry for you,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, laughing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311311"><said direct="false">'And how do you mean to face Maurice?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311312"><said direct="true">'Tell him his first bugle has so distracted me that I can'</said><said direct="false">t answer for the consequences if I come to-night.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311313"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone came in, saying,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311314"><said direct="false">'Come, I have kept you waiting shamefully, but I have been consoling myself by thinking you must be well entertained, as I heard no Harmonious Blacksmith. Papa will be wondering where we are.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311315"><said direct="true">'Oh, mamma! Guy won'</said><said direct="false">t go.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311316"><said direct="false">'Guy! is anything the matter?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311317"><said direct="false">'Nothing, thank you, only idleness.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311318"><said direct="false">'This will never do. You really must go, Guy.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311319"><said direct="true">'Indeed I think not. Pray don'</said><said direct="false">t order me, Mrs. Edmonstone.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311320"><said direct="true">'What o'</said><said direct="false">clock is it, Amy? Past ten! Papa will be in despair! What is to be done? How long do you take to dress, Guy?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311321"><said direct="true">'Not under an hour,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, smiling.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311322"><said direct="true">'Nonsense! But if there was time I should certainly send you. Self-discipline may be carried too far, Guy. But now it can'</said><said direct="false">t be helped—I don't know how to keep papa waiting any longer. Laura, what shall I do?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311323"><said direct="true">'Let me go to Charles,'</said><said direct="false"> answered Guy. 'Perhaps I can read him to sleep.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311324"><said direct="true">'Thank you; but don'</said><said direct="false">t talk, or he will be too excited. Reading would be the very thing! It will be a pretty story to tell every one who asks for you that I have left you to nurse my son!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311325"><said direct="true">'No, for no such good reason,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy; 'only because I am a great fool.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311326"><said direct="true">'Well, Sir Guy, I am glad you can say one sensible word,'</said><said direct="false"> said Lady Eveleen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311327"><said direct="true">'Too true, I assure you,'</said><said direct="false"> he answered, as he handed her in. 'Good night! You will keep the quadrille for me till I am rational.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311328"><said direct="false">He handed the others in, and shut the door. Mrs. Edmonstone, ruffled out of her composure, exclaimed,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311329"><said direct="false">'Well, this is provoking!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311330"><said direct="true">'Every one will be vexed,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311331"><said direct="true">'It will be so stupid!'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311332"><said direct="true">'I give him up,'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen. 'I once had hopes of him!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311333"><said direct="true">'If it was not for papa, I really would turn back this moment and fetch him,'</said><said direct="false"> cried Mrs. Edmonstone, starting forward. 'I'm sure it will give offence. I wish I had not consented.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311334"><said direct="true">'He can'</said><said direct="false">t be made to see that his presence is of importance to any living creature,' said Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311335"><said direct="true">'What is the reason of this whim?'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311336"><said direct="true">'No, Eveleen, it is not whim,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura; 'it is because he thinks dissipation makes him idle.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311337"><said direct="true">'Then if he is idle, I wonder what the rest of the world is!'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen. 'I am sure we all ought to stay at home too.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311338"><said direct="true">'I think so,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy. 'I know I shall feel all night as if I was wrong to be there.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311339"><said direct="true">'I am angry,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone; 'and yet I believe it is a great sacrifice.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311340"><said direct="true">'Yes, mamma; after all our looking forward to it,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy. 'Oh! yes,' and her voice lost its piteous tone, 'it is a real sacrifice.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311341"><said direct="true">'If he was not a mere boy, I should say a lover'</said><said direct="false">s quarrel was at the bottom of it,' said Eveleen. 'Depend upon it, Laura, it is all your fault. You only danced once with him at our ball, and all this week you have played for us, as if it was on purpose to cut him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311342"><said direct="false">Laura was glad of the darkness, and her mother, who had a particular dislike to jokes of this sort, went on,—'If it were only ourselves I should not care, but there are so many who will fancy it caprice, or worse.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311343"><said direct="true">'The only comfort is,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, 'that it is Charlie's gain.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311344"><said direct="true">'I hope they will not talk,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone. 'But Charlie will never hold his tongue. He will grow excited, and not sleep all night.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311345"><said direct="false">Poor Mrs. Edmonstone! her trials did not end here, for when she replied to her husband's inquiry for Guy, Mr. Edmonstone said offence had already been taken at his absence from the dinner; he would not have had this happen for fifty pounds; she ought not to have suffered it; but it was all her nonsense about Charles, and as to not being late, she should have waited till midnight rather than not have brought him. In short, he said as much more than he meant, as a man in a pet is apt to say, and nevertheless Mrs. Edmonstone had to look as amiable and smiling as if nothing was the matter.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311346"><said direct="false">The least untruthful answer she could frame to the inquiries for Sir Guy Morville was, that young men were apt to be lazy about balls, and this sufficed for good-natured Mrs. Deane, but Maurice poured out many exclamations about his ill-behavour, and Philip contented himself with the mere fact of his not being there, and made no remark.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311347"><said direct="false">Laura turned her eyes anxiously on Philip. They had not met since the important conversation on Ashen-down, and she found herself looking with more pride than ever at his tall, noble figure, as if he was more her own; but the calmness of feeling was gone. She could not meet his eye, nor see him turn towards her without a start and tremor for which she could not render herself a reason, and her heart beat so much that it was at once a relief and a disappointment that she was obliged to accept her other cousin as her first partner. Philip had already asked Lady Eveleen, for he neither wished to appear too eager in claiming Laura, nor to let his friends think he had any dislike to the Irish girl.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311348"><said direct="false">Eveleen was much pleased to have him for her partner, and told herself she would be on her good behaviour. It was a polka, and there was not much talk, which, perhaps, was all the better for her. She admired the review, and the luncheon, and spoke to Charles without any sauciness, and Philip was condescending and agreeable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311349"><said direct="true">'I must indulge myself in abusing that stupid cousin of yours!'</said><said direct="false"> said she. 'Did you ever know a man of such wonderful crotchets?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311350"><said direct="true">'This is a very unexpected one,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311351"><said direct="false">'It came like a thunderclap. I thought till the last moment he was joking, for he likes dancing so much; he was the life of our ball, and how could any one suppose he would fly off at the last moment?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311352"><said direct="false">'He seems rather to enjoy doing things suddenly.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311353"><said direct="true">'I tell Laura she has affronted him,'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen, laughing. 'She has been always busy of late when we have wanted her; and I assure her his pride has been piqued. Don't you think that is an explanation, Captain Morville?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311354"><said direct="false">It was Captain Morville's belief, but he would not say so.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311355"><said direct="true">'Isn'</said><said direct="false">t Laura looking lovely?' Eveleen went on. 'I am sure she is the beauty of the night!' She was pleased to see Captain Morville's attention gained. 'She is even better dressed than at our ball—those Venetian pins suit the form of her head so well. Her beauty is better than almost any one's, because she has so much countenance.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311356"><said direct="true">'True,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311357"><said direct="false">'How proud Maurice looks of having her on his arm. Does not he? Poor Maurice! he is desperately in love with her!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311358"><said direct="false">'As is shown by his pining melancholy.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311359"><said direct="false">Eveleen laughed with her clear hearty laugh. 'I see you know what we mean by being desperately in love! No,' she added, more gravely, 'I am very glad it is only that kind of desperation. One could not think of Maurice and Laura together. He does not know the best part of Laura.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311360"><said direct="false">Eveleen was highly flattered by Captain Morville conducting her a second time round the room, instead of at once restoring her to her aunt.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311361"><said direct="false">He secured Laura next, and leading her away from her own party, said, 'Laura, have you been overdoing it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311362"><said direct="true">'It is not that,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, wishing she could keep from blushing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311363"><said direct="false">'It is the only motive that could excuse his extraordinary behaviour.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311364"><said direct="false">'Surely you know he says that he is growing unsettled. It is part of his rule of self-discipline.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311365"><said direct="true">'Absurd!—exaggerated!—incredible! This is the same story as there was about the horse. It is either caprice or temper, and I am convinced that some change in your manner—nay, I say unconscious, and am far from blaming you—is the cause. Why else did he devote himself to Charles, and leave you all on my uncle'</said><said direct="false">s hands in the crowd?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311366"><said direct="false">'We could shift for ourselves much better than Charlie.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311367"><said direct="false">'This confirms my belief that my warning was not mistimed. I wish it could have been done without decidedly mortifying him and rousing his temper, because I am sorry others should be slighted; but if he takes your drawing back so much to heart, it shows that it was time you should do so.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311368"><said direct="false">'If I thought I had!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311369"><said direct="false">'It was visible to others—to another, I should say.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311370"><said direct="true">'O, that is only Eveleen'</said><said direct="false">s nonsense! The only difference, I am conscious of having made, was keeping more up stairs, and not trying to persuade him to come here to-night.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311371"><said direct="false">'I have no doubt it was this that turned the scale. He only waited for persuasion, and you acted very wisely in not flattering his self-love.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311372"><said direct="false">'Did I?—I did not know it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311373"><said direct="true">'A woman'</said><said direct="false">s instinct is often better than reasoning, Laura; to do the right thing without knowing why. But come, I suppose we must play our part in the pageant of the night.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311374"><said direct="false">For that evening, Laura, contrary to the evidence of her senses, was persuaded by her own lover that Guy was falling in love with her; and after musing all through the dance she said, 'What do you think of the scheme that has been started for my going to Ireland with papa?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311375"><said direct="false">'Your going to Ireland?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311376"><said direct="false">'Yes; you know none of us, except papa, have seen grandmamma since Charles began to be ill, and there is some talk of his taking me with him when he goes this summer.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311377"><said direct="false">'I knew he was going, but I thought it was not to be till later in the year—not till after the long vacation.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311378"><said direct="false">'So he intended, but he finds he must be at home before the end of October, and it would suit him best to go in August.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311379"><said direct="false">'Then what becomes of Guy?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311380"><said direct="false">'He stays at Hollywell. It will be much better for Charles to have him there while papa is away. I thought when the plan was first mentioned I should be sorry, except that it is quite right to go to grandmamma; but if it is so, about Guy, this absence would be a good thing—it would make a break, and I could begin again on different terms.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311381"><said direct="false">'Wisely judged, Laura. Yes, on that account it would be very desirable, though it will be a great loss to me, and I can hardly hope to be so near you on your return.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311382"><said direct="true">'Ah! yes, so I feard!'</said><said direct="false"> sighed Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311383"><said direct="true">'But we must give up something; and for Guy'</said><said direct="false">s own sake, poor fellow, it will be better to make a break, as you say. It will save him pain by-and by.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311384"><said direct="false">'I dare say papa will consult you about when his journey is to be. His only doubt was whether it would do to leave Guy so long alone; and if you say it would be safe, it would decide him at once.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311385"><said direct="false">'I see little chance of mischief. Guy has few temptations here, and a strong sense of honour; besides, I shall be at hand. Taking all things into consideration, Laura, I think that, whatever the sacrifice to ourselves, it is expedient to recommend his going at once, and your accompanying him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311386"><said direct="false">All the remainder of the evening Philip was occupied with attentions to the rest of the world, but Laura's eyes followed him everywhere, and though she neither expected nor desired him to bestow more time on her, she underwent a strange restlessness and impatience of feeling. Her numerous partners teased her by hindering her from watching him moving about the room, catching his tones, and guessing what he was talking of;— not that she wanted to meet his eye, for she did not like to blush, nor did she think it pleased him to see her do so, for he either looked away immediately or conveyed a glance which she understood as monitory. She kept better note of his countenance than of her own partner's.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311387"><said direct="false">Mr. Thorndale, meanwhile, kept aloof from Lady Eveleen de Courcy, but Captain Morville perceived that his eyes were often turned towards her, and well knew it was principle, and not inclination, that held him at a distance. He did indeed once ask her to dance, but she was engaged, and he did not ask her to reserve a future dance for him, but contented himself with little Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311388"><said direct="false">Amy was doing her best to enjoy herself, because she thought it ungrateful not to receive pleasure from those who wished to give it, but to her it wanted the zest and animation of Lady Kilcoran's ball. Besides, she knew she had been as idle as Guy, or still more so, and she thought it wrong she should have pleasure while he was doing penance. It was on her mind, and damped her spirits, and though she smiled, and talked, and admired, and danced lightly and gaily, there was a sensation of weariness throughout, and no one but Eveleen was sorry when Mrs. Edmonstone sent Maurice to see for the carriage.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311389"><said direct="false">Philip was one of the gentlemen who came to shawl them. As he put Laura's cloak round her shoulders he was able to whisper, 'Take care; you must be cautious —self-command.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311390"><said direct="false">Laura, though blushing and shrinking the moment before, was braced by his words and tone to attempt all he wished. She looked up in what she meant to be an indifferent manner, and made some observation in a careless tone—anything rather than let Philip think her silly. After what he had said, was she not bound more than ever to exert herself to the utmost, that he might not be disappointed in her? She loved him only the better for what others might have deemed a stern coldness of manner, for it made the contrast of his real warmth of affection more precious. She mused over it, as much as her companions' conversation would allow, on the road home. They arrived, Mrs. Edmonstone peeped into Charles's room, announced that he was quietly asleep, and they all bade each other good night, or good morning, and parted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311391"><said direct="false">Goethe's Tasso.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311392"><said direct="false">When the Hollywell party met at breakfast, Charles showed himself by no means the worse for his yesterday's experiment. He said he had gone to sleep in reasonable time, lulled by some poetry, he knew not what, of which Guy's voice had made very pretty music, and he was now full of talk about the amusement he had enjoyed yesterday, which seemed likely to afford food for conversation for many a week to come.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311393"><said direct="false">After all the care Guy had taken of him, Mrs. Edmonstone could not find it in her heart to scold, and her husband having spent his vexation upon her, had none left to bestow on the real culprit. So when Guy, with his bright morning face, and his hair hanging shining and wet round it, opened the dining-room door, on his return from bathing in the river, Mr. Edmonstone's salutation only conveyed that humorous anger that no one cares for.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311394"><said direct="false">'Good morning to you, Sir Guy Morville! I wonder what you have to say for yourself.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311395"><said direct="true">'Nothing,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, smiling; then, as he took his place by Mrs. Edmonstone, ' I hope you are not tired after your hard day's work?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311396"><said direct="false">'Not at all, thank you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311397"><said direct="false">'Amy, can you tell me the name of this flower?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311398"><said direct="true">'Oh! have you really found the arrow-head! How beautiful! Where did you get it? I didn'</said><said direct="false">t know it grew in our river.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311399"><said direct="false">'There is plenty of it in that reedy place beyond the turn. I thought it looked like something out of the common way.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311400"><said direct="false">'Yes! What a purple eye it has! I must draw it. O, thank you!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311401"><said direct="true">'And, Charlotte, Bustle has found you a moorhen'</said><said direct="false">s nest.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311402"><said direct="false">'How delightful! Is it where I can go and see the dear little things?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311403"><said direct="true">'It is rather a swamp; but I have been putting down stepping-stones for you, and I dare say I can jump you across. It was that which made me so late, for which I ought to have asked pardon,'</said><said direct="false"> said he to Mrs. Edmonstone, with his look of courtesy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311404"><said direct="false">Never did man look less like an offended lover, or like a morose self-tormentor.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311405"><said direct="true">'There are others later,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at Lady Eveleen's empty chair.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311406"><said direct="true">'So you think that is all you have to ask pardon for,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mr. Edmonstone. 'I advise you to study your apologies, for you are in pretty tolerable disgrace.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311407"><said direct="true">'Indeed, I am very sorry,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, with such a change of countenance that Mr. Edmonstone's good nature could not bear to see it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311408"><said direct="true">'Oh, '</said><said direct="false">tis no concern of mine! It would be going rather the wrong way, indeed, for you to be begging my pardon for all the care you've been taking of Charlie; but you had better consider what you have to say for yourself before you show your face at Broadstone.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311409"><said direct="true">'No?'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, puzzled for a moment, but quickly looking relieved, and laughing, 'What! Broadstone in despair for want of me?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311410"><said direct="false">'And we perfectly exhausted with answering questions as to what was become of Sir Guy.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311411"><said direct="true">'Dreadful,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, now laughing heartily, in the persuasion that it was all a joke. 'O, Lady Eveleen, good morning; you are come in good time to give me the story of the ball, for no one else tells me one word about it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311412"><said direct="true">'Because you don'</said><said direct="false">t deserve it,' said she. 'I hope you have repented by this time.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311413"><said direct="false">'If you want to make me repent, you should give me a very alluring description.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311414"><said direct="true">'I sha'</said><said direct="false">n't say one word about it; I shall send you to Coventry, as Maurice and all the regiment mean to do,' said Eveleen, turning away from him with a very droll arch manner of offended dignity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311415"><said direct="true">'Hear, hear! Eveleen send any one to Coventry!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Charles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311416"><said direct="false">'See what the regiment say to you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311417"><said direct="false">'Ay, when I am sent to Coventry?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311418"><said direct="true">'O! Paddy, Paddy!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Charles, and there was a general laugh.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311419"><said direct="true">'Laura seems to be doing it in good earnest without announcing it,'</said><said direct="false"> added Charles, when the laugh was over, 'which is the worst sign of all.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311420"><said direct="true">'Nonsense, Charles,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, hastily, then afraid she had owned to annoyance, she blushed, and was angry with herself for blushing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311421"><said direct="false">'Well, Laura, do tell me who your partners were.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311422"><said direct="false">Very provoking, thought Laura, that I cannot say what is so perfectly natural and ordinary without my foolish cheeks tingling. He may think it is because he is speaking to me. So she hurried on; 'Maurice first, then Philip,' and then showed, what Amy and Eveleen thought, strange oblivion of the rest of the partners.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311423"><said direct="false">They proceeded into the history of the ball; and Guy thought no more of his offences till the following day, when he went to Broadstone. Coming back, he found the drawing-room full of visitors, and was obliged to sit down and join in the conversation; but Mrs. Edmonstone saw he was inwardly chafing, as he betrayed by his inability to remain still, the twitchings of his forehead and lip, and a tripping and stumbling of the words on his tongue. She was sure he wanted to talk to her, and longed to get rid of Mrs. Brownlow; but the door was no sooner shut on the visitors than Mr. Edmonstone came in, with a long letter for her to read and comment upon. Guy took himself out of the way of the consultation, and began to hurry up and down the terrace, until, seeing Amabel crossing the field towards the little gate into the garden, he went to open it for her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311424"><said direct="false">She looked up at him, and exclaimed—'Is anything the matter?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311425"><said direct="true">'Nothing to signify,'</said><said direct="false"> he said; 'I was only waiting for your mother. I have got into a mess, that is all.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311426"><said direct="true">'I am sorry,'</said><said direct="false"> began Amy, there resting in the doubt whether she might inquire further, and intending not to burthen him with her company any longer than till she reached the house door; but Guy went on,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311427"><said direct="false">'No, you have no occasion to be sorry; it is all my own fault; at least, if I was clear how it is my fault, I should not mind it so much. It is that ball. I am sure I had not the least notion any one would care whether I was there or not.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311428"><said direct="false">'I am sure we missed you very much.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311429"><said direct="false">'You are all so kind; beside, I belong in a manner to you; but what could it signify to any one else? And here I find that I have vexed every one.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311430"><said direct="true">'Ah!'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, 'mamma said she was afraid it would give offence.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311431"><said direct="true">'I ought to have attended to her. It was a fit of self-will in managing myself,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, murmuring low, as if trying to find the real indictment; 'yet I thought it a positive duty;—wrong every way.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311432"><said direct="true">'What has happened?'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, turning back with him, though she had reached the door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311433"><said direct="true">'Why, the first person I met was Mr. Gordon; and he spoke, like your father, half in joke, and I thought entirely so; he said something about all the world being in such a rage, that I was a bold man to venture into Broadstone. Then, while I was at Mr. Lascelles'</said><said direct="false">, in came Dr. Mayerne. ' We missed you at the dinner,' he said; 'and I hear you shirked the ball too.' I told him how it was, and he said he was glad that was all, and advised me to go and call on Colonel Deane and explain. I thought that the best way—indeed, I meant it before, and was walking to his lodgings when Maurice de Courcy met me. 'Ha!' he cries out, 'Morville! I thought at least you would have been laid up for a month with the typhus fever! As a friend, I advise you to go home and catch something, for it is the only excuse that will serve you. I am not quite sure that it will not be high treason for me to be seen speaking to you.' I tried to get at the rights of it, but he is such a harum-scarum fellow there was no succeeding. Next I met Thorndale, who only bowed and passed on the other side of the street—sign enough how it was with Philip; so I thought it best to go at once to the Captain, and get a rational account of what was the matter.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311434"><said direct="true">'Did you?'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, who, though concerned and rather alarmed, had been smiling at the humorous and expressive tones with which he could not help giving effect to his narration.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311435"><said direct="false">'Yes. Philip was at home, and very—very—'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311436"><said direct="true">'Gracious?'</said><said direct="false"> suggested Amy, as he hesitated for a word.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311437"><said direct="false">'Just so. Only the vexatious thing was, that we never could succeed in coming to an understanding. He was ready to forgive; but I could not disabuse him of an idea—where he picked it up I cannot guess—that I had stayed away out of pique. He would not even tell me what he thought had affronted me, though I asked him over and over again to be only straightforward; he declared I knew.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311438"><said direct="true">'How excessively provoking!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Amy. 'You cannot guess what he meant?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311439"><said direct="false">'Not the least in the world. I have not the most distant suspicion. It was of no use to declare I was not offended with any one; he only looked in that way of his, as if he knew much better than I did myself, and told me he could make allowances.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311440"><said direct="false">'Worse than all! How horrid of him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311441"><said direct="true">'No, don'</said><said direct="false">t spoil me. No doubt he thinks he has grounds, and my irritation was unjustifiable. Yes, I got into my old way. He cautioned me, and nearly made me mad! I never was nearer coming to a regular outbreak. Always the same! Fool that I am.'</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG185312554"><said direct="false">Mr. Edmonstone brought the carriage to fetch him from the station, and quickly began,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312555"><said direct="false">'I suppose, as you have not written, you have found nothing out?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312556"><said direct="false">'Nothing.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312557"><said direct="false">'And you could do nothing with him. Eh?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312558"><said direct="false">'No; I could not get a word of explanation nor break through the fence of pride and reserve. I must do him the justice to say that he bears the best of characters at Oxford; and if there were any debts I could not get at them from the tradesmen.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312559"><said direct="true">'Well, well, say no more about it; he is an ungrateful young dog, and I am sick of it. I only wish I could wash my hands of him altogether. It was mere folly to expect any of that set could ever come to good. There'</said><said direct="false">s everything going wrong all at once now; poor little Amy breaking her heart after him, and, worse than all, there's poor Charlie laid up again,' said Mr. Edmonstone, one of the most affectionate people in the world; but his maundering mood making him speak of Charles's illness as if he only regarded it as an additional provocation for himself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312560"><said direct="true">'Charles ill!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312561"><said direct="false">'Yes; another of those formations in the joint. I hoped and trusted that was all over now; but he is as bad as ever,—has not been able to move for a week, and goodness knows when he will again.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312562"><said direct="false">'Indeed! I am very sorry. Is there as much pain as before?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312563"><said direct="false">'Oh, yes. He has not slept a wink these four nights. Mayerne talks of opium; but he says he wont have it till he has seen you, he is so anxious about this unlucky business. If anything could persuade me to have Guy back again, it would be that this eternal fretting after him is so bad for poor Charlie.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312564"><said direct="true">'It is on Amy'</said><said direct="false">s account that it is impossible to have him here,' said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312565"><said direct="false">'Ay! He shall never set eyes on Amy again unless all this is cleared up, which it never will be, as I desire mamma to tell her. By-the-bye, Philip, Amy said something of your having a slip with Charles on the stairs.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312566"><said direct="false">There was very nearly an accident; but I believed he was not hurt. I hope it has nothing to do with this illness?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312567"><said direct="true">'He says it was all his own fault,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mr. Edmonstone, 'and that he should have been actually down but for you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312568"><said direct="false">'But is it really thought it can have caused this attack?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312569"><said direct="true">'I can hardly suppose so; but Thompson fancies there may have been some jar. However, don'</said><said direct="false">t distress yourself, I dare say it would have come on all the same.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312570"><said direct="false">Philip did not like to be forgiven by Mr. Edmonstone, and there was something very annoying in having this mischance connected with his name, though without his fault; nor did he wish Charles to have the kind of advantage over him that might be derived from seeming to pass over his share in the misfortune.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312571"><said direct="false">When they arrived at Hollywell, it was twilight, but no one was in the drawing-room, generally so cheerful at that time of day; the fire had lately been smothered with coals, and looked gloomy and desolate. Mr. Edmonstone left Philip there, and ran up to see how Charles was, and soon after Laura came in, sprang to his side, and held his hand in both hers.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312572"><said direct="true">'You bring no good news?'</said><said direct="false"> said she, sadly, as she read the answer in his face. 'Oh! how I wish you had. It would be such a comfort now. You have heard about poor Charlie?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312573"><said direct="false">'Yes; and very sorry I am. But, Laura, is it really thought that accident could have occasioned it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312574"><said direct="true">'Dr. Mayerne does not think so, only Mr. Thompson talked of remote causes, when Amy mentioned it. I don'</said><said direct="false">t believe it did any harm, and Charlie himself says you saved him from falling down stairs.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312575"><said direct="false">Philip had begun to give Laura his version of the accident, as he had already done to her father, when Mrs. Edmonstone came down, looking harassed and anxious. She told her nephew that Charles was very desirous to see him, and sent him up at once.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312576"><said direct="false">There was a fire in the dressing-room, and the door was open into the little room, which was only lighted by a lamp on a small table, where Amy was sitting at work. After shaking hands, she went away, leaving him alone with Charles, who lay in his narrow bed against the wall, fixed in one position, his forehead contracted with pain, his eyelids red and heavy from sleeplessness, his eyes very quick and eager, and his hands and arms thrown restlessly outside the coverings.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312577"><said direct="true">'I am very sorry to find you here,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, coming up to him, and taking, rather than receiving, his hot, limp hand. 'Is the pain very bad?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312578"><said direct="true">'That is a matter of course,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, in a sharp, quick manner, his voice full of suffering. 'I want to hear what you have been doing at Oxford and St. Mildred's.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312579"><said direct="false">'I am sorry I do not bring the tidings you wish.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312580"><said direct="true">'I did not expect you would. I know you too well; but I want to hear what you have been doing—what he said,'</said><said direct="false"> answered Charles, in short, impatient sentences.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312581"><said direct="false">'It can be of no use, Charlie. You are not in a state to enter on agitating subjects.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312582"><said direct="true">'I tell you I will hear all,'</said><said direct="false"> returned Charles, with increased asperity. 'I know you will say nothing to his advantage that you can help, but still I know you will speak what you think the truth, and I want to judge for myself.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312583"><said direct="false">'You speak as if I was not acting for his good.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312584"><said direct="true">'Palaver!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Charles, fully sensible of the advantage his illness gave him. 'I want the facts. Begin at the beginning. Sit down—there's a chair by you. Now tell me, where did you find him?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312585"><said direct="false">Philip could not set Charles down in his present state, and was obliged to submit to a cross-examination, in which he showed no abatement of his natural acuteness, and, unsparing as he always was, laid himself under no restraint at all. Philip was compelled to give a full history of his researches; and if he had afforded no triumph to Guy, Charles revenged him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312586"><said direct="false">'Pray, what did Guy say when he heard the result of this fine voyage of discovery?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312587"><said direct="false">'I did not see him again.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312588"><said direct="false">'Not see him! not tell him he was so far justified!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312589"><said direct="false">'I had no time—at least I thought not. It would have been useless, for while these mysteries continue, my opinion is unchanged, and there was no benefit in renewing vain disputes.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312590"><said direct="true">'Say no more!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Charles. 'You have said all I expected, and more too. I gave you credit for domineering and prejudice, now I see it is malignity.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312591"><said direct="false">As he spoke, Laura entered from the dressing-room, and stood aghast at the words, then looked imploringly at her cousin. Dr. Mayerne was following her, and Charles called out,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312592"><said direct="false">'Now, doctor, give me as much opium as you please. I only want to be stupified till the world has turned round, and then you may wake me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312593"><said direct="false">Philip shook hands with Dr. Mayerne, and, without betraying a shade of annoyance, wished Charles good night, but Charles had drawn the coverings over his head, and would not hear him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312594"><said direct="true">'Poor fellow!'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip to Laura, when they were out of the room. 'He is a very generous partizan, and excitement and suffering make him carry his zeal to excess.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312595"><said direct="false">'I knew you could not be angry with him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312596"><said direct="false">'I could not be angry at this time at far more provocation given by any one belonging to you, Laura.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312597"><said direct="false">Laura's heart had that sensation which the French call se serrer , as she heard him allude to the long separation to which there seemed no limit; but they could say no more.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312598"><said direct="true">'Amy,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, when she returned to him after dinner, 'I am more than ever convinced that things will right themselves. I never saw prejudice more at fault.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312599"><said direct="false">'Did he tell you all about it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312600"><said direct="false">'I worked out of him all I could, and it is my belief Guy had the best of it. I only wonder he did not horsewhip Philip round the quadrangle. I wish he had.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312601"><said direct="false">'Oh, no, no! But he controlled himself?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312602"><said direct="true">'If he had not we should have heard of it fast enough;'</said><said direct="false"> and Charles told what he had been able to gather, while she sat by, divided between joy and pain.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312603"><said direct="false">Philip saw very little more of Charles. He used to come to ask him how he was once a-day, but never received any encouragement to lengthen his visit. These gatherings in the diseased joint were always excessively painful, and were very long in coming to the worst, as well as afterwards in healing, and through the week of Philip's stay at Hollywell Charles was either in a state of great suffering, or else heavy and confused with opiates. His mother's whole time and thoughts were absorbed in him; she attended to him day and night, and could hardly spare a moment for anything else. Indeed, with all her affection and anxiety for the young lovers, Charles was so entirely her engrossing object, that her first feeling of disappointment at the failure of Philip's journey of investigation was because it would grieve Charlie. She could not think about Guy just then, and for Amy, there was nothing for it but patience; and, good little creature, it was very nice to see her put her own troubles aside, and be so cheerful a nurse to her brother. She was almost always in his room, for he liked to have her there, and she could not conquer a certain shrinking from Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312604"><said direct="false">Laura had once pleaded hard and earnestly for Guy with Philip, but all in vain, she only was taught to think the case more hopeless than before. Laura was a very kind nurse and sister, but she could better be spared than her mother and Amy, so that it generally fell to her lot to be downstairs, making the drawing-room habitable. Dr. Mayerne, whenever Charles was ill, used to be more at Hollywell than at his own house, and there were few days that he did not dine there. When Amy was out of the way, Philip used to entertain them with long accounts of Redclyffe, how fine a place it was, how far the estate reached on the Moorworth road, of its capacities for improvement, wastes of moorland to be enclosed or planted, magnificent timber needing nothing but thinning. He spoke of the number of tenantry, and the manorial rights, and the influence in both town and county, which, in years gone by, had been proved to the utmost in many a fierce struggle with the house of Thorndale. Sir Guy Morville might be one of the first men in England if he were not wanting to himself. Mr. Edmonstone enjoyed such talk, for it made him revel in the sense of his own magnanimity in refusing his daughter to the owner of all this, and Laura sometimes thought how Philip would have graced such a position, yet how much greater it was to rest entirely on his own merits.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312605"><said direct="true">'Ah, my fine fellow!'</said><said direct="false"> muttered Dr. Mayerne to himself one day, when Philip and his uncle had left the room, just after a discourse of this kind, 'I see you have not forgotten you are the next heir.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312606"><said direct="false">Laura coloured with indignation, exclaimed 'Oh!' then checked herself, as if such an aspersion was not worthy of her taking the trouble to refute it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312607"><said direct="false">'Ah! Miss Edmonstone, I did not know you were there!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312608"><said direct="true">'Yes, you were talking to yourself, just as if you were at home,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte, who was specially pert to the old doctor, because she knew herself to be a great pet. 'You were telling some home truths to make Laura angry.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312609"><said direct="true">'Well, he would make a very good use of it if he had it,'</said><said direct="false"> said the doctor.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312610"><said direct="true">'Now you'</said><said direct="false">ll make me angry,' said Charlotte; 'and you have not mended matters with Laura. She thinks nothing short of four-syllabled words good enough for Philip.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312611"><said direct="true">'Hush! nonsense, Charlotte!'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, much annoyed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312612"><said direct="true">'There, Charlotte, she is avenging herself on you because she can'</said><said direct="false">t scold me,' said the doctor, pretending to whisper.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312613"><said direct="true">'Charlotte is only growing more wild than ever for want of mamma,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, trying to laugh it off; but there was so much annoyance evident about her, that Dr. Mayerne said,—'Seriously, I must apologize for my unlucky soliloquy; not that I thought I was saying much harm, for I did not by any means say or think the Captain wished Sir Guy any ill, and few men who stood next in succession to such a property would be likely to forget it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312614"><said direct="true">'Yes, but Philip is not like other men,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte, who, at fourteen, had caught much of her brother's power of repartee, and could be quite as provoking, when unrestrained by any one whom she cared to obey.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312615"><said direct="false">Laura felt it was more for her dignity not to notice this, and replied, with an effort for a laugh,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312616"><said direct="false">'It must be your guilty conscience that sets you apologizing, for you said no harm, as you observe.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312617"><said direct="true">'Yes,'</said><said direct="false"> said Dr. Mayerne, good-humouredly. 'He does very well without it, and no doubt he would be one of the first men in the country if he had it; but it is in very good hands now, on the whole. I don't think, even if the lad has been tempted into a little folly just now, that he can ever go very far wrong.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312618"><said direct="true">'No, indeed,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte; 'but Charlie and I don't believe he has done anything wrong.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312619"><said direct="false">She spoke in a little surly decided tone, as if her opinion put an end to the matter, and Philip's return closed the discussion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312620"><said direct="false">Divided as the party were between upstairs and downstairs, and in the absence of Charles's shrewd observation, Philip and Laura had more opportunity of intercourse than usual, and now that his departure would put an end to suspicion, they ventured on more openly seeking each other. It never could be the perfect freedom that they had enjoyed before the avowal of their sentiments, but they had many brief conversations, giving Laura feverish, but exquisite, delight at each renewal of his rare expressions of tenderness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312621"><said direct="true">'What are you going to do to-day?'</said><said direct="false"> he asked, on the last morning before he was to leave Hollywell. 'I must see you alone before I go.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312622"><said direct="false">She looked down, and he kept his eyes fixed on her rather sternly, for he had never before made a clandestine appointment, and he did not like feeling ashamed of it. At last she said,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312623"><said direct="false">'I go to East Hill School this afternoon. I shall come away at half-past three.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312624"><said direct="false">Mary Ross was still absent; her six nephews and nieces having taken advantage of her visit to have the measles, not like reasonable children, all at once, so as to be one trouble, but one after the other, so as to keep Aunt Mary with them as long as possible; and Mr. Ross did not know what would have become of the female department of his parish but for Laura, who worked at school-keeping indefatigably.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312625"><said direct="false">Laura had some difficulty in shaking off Charlotte's company this afternoon, and was obliged to make the most of the probability of rain, and the dreadful dirt of the roads. Indeed, she represented it as so formidable, that Mrs. Edmonstone, who had hardly time to look out of window, much less to go out of doors, strongly advised her to stay at home herself; and Charlotte grew all the more eager for the fun. Luckily, however, for Laura, Dr. Mayerne came in, laughing at the reports of the weather, and as he was wanted to prescribe for a poor old man in an opposite direction, he took Charlotte with him to show the way, and she was much better pleased to have him for a companion than the grave Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312626"><said direct="false">Philip in the meantime had walked all the way to Broadstone, timing his return exactly, that he might meet Laura as she came out of the school, and feel as if it had been by chance. It was a grey, misty November day, and the leaves of the elm-trees came floating round them, yellow and damp.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312627"><said direct="true">'You have had a wet walk,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, as they met.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312628"><said direct="true">'It is not quite raining,'</said><said direct="false"> he answered, and they proceeded for some minutes in silence, until he said,—'It is time we should come to an understanding.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312629"><said direct="false">She looked at him in alarm, and his voice was immediately gentler; indeed, at times it was almost inaudible from his strong emotion. 'I believe that no affection has ever been stronger or truer than ours.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312630"><said direct="true">'Has been!'</said><said direct="false"> repeated Laura, in a wondering, bewildered voice.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312631"><said direct="false">'And is, if you are satisfied to leave things as they are.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312632"><said direct="false">'I must be, if you are.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312633"><said direct="false">'I will not say I am satisfied with what must be, as I am situated; but I felt it due to you to set the true state of the case before you. Few would venture their love as I do mine with you, bound in reality, though not formally, with no promise sought or given; yet I am not more assured that I stand here than I am that our love is for ever.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312634"><said direct="true">'I am sure it is!'</said><said direct="false"> she repeated, fervently. 'O Philip, there never was a time I did not love you; and since that day on Ashen Down, I have loved you with my whole heart. I am sometimes afraid it has left no proper room for the rest, when I find how much more I think of your going away than of poor Charles.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312635"><said direct="true">'Yes,'</said><said direct="false"> he said, 'you have understood me as none but you would have done, through coldness and reserve, apparently, even towards yourself, and when to others I have seemed grave and severe beyond my years. You have never doubted, you have recognised the warmth within; you have trusted your happiness to me, and it shall be safe in my keeping, for, Laura, it is all mine.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312636"><said direct="true">'There is only one thing,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, timidly; 'would it not be better if mamma knew?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312637"><said direct="false">'Laura, I have considered that; but remember, you are not bound; I have never asked you to bind yourself. You might marry to-morrow, and I should have no right to complain. There is nothing to prevent you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312638"><said direct="false">She exclaimed, as if with pain.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312639"><said direct="true">'True,'</said><said direct="false"> he answered, 'you could not, and that certainty suffices me. I ask no more without your parents' consent; but it would be giving them and you useless distress and perplexity to ask it now. They would object to my poverty, and we should gain nothing; for I would never be so selfish as to wish to expose you to such a life as that of the wife of a poor officer; and an open engagement could not add to our confidence in each other. We must be content to wait for my promotion. By that time'—he smiled gravely— 'our attachment will have lasted so many years as to give it a claim to respect.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312640"><said direct="false">'It is no new thing.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312641"><said direct="false">'No newer than our lives; but remember, my Laura, that you are but twenty.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312642"><said direct="true">'You have made me feel much older,'</said><said direct="false"> sighed Laura; 'not that I would be a thoughtless child again. That cannot last long, not even for poor little Amy.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312643"><said direct="false">'No one would wish to part with the deeper feelings of elder years to regain the carelessness of childhood, even to be exempted from the suffering that has brought them.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312644"><said direct="false">'No, indeed.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312645"><said direct="false">'For instance, these two years have scarcely been a time of great happiness to you?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312646"><said direct="true">'Sometimes,'</said><said direct="false"> whispered Laura, 'sometimes beyond all words, but often dreary and oppressive.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312647"><said direct="false">'Heaven knows how unwillingly I have rendered it so. Rather than dim the brightness of your life, I would have repressed my own sentiments for ever.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312648"><said direct="false">'But, then, where would have been my brightness?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312649"><said direct="false">'I would, I say, but for a peril to you. I see my fears were unfounded. You were safe; but in my desire to guard you from what has come on poor Amy, my feelings, though not wont to overpower me, carried me further than I intended.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312650"><said direct="false">'Did they?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312651"><said direct="false">'Do not suppose I regret it. No, no, Laura, those were the most precious moments of my life, when I drew from you those words and looks which have been blessed in remembrance ever since; and doubly, knowing, as I do, that you also prize that day.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312652"><said direct="false">'Yes—yes—'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312653"><said direct="false">'In the midst of much that was adverse, and with a necessity for a trust and self-control of which scarce a woman but yourself would have been capable, you have endured nobly—'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312654"><said direct="false">'I could bear anything, if you were not going so far away.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312655"><said direct="false">'You will bear that, too, Laura, and bravely. It will not be for ever.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312656"><said direct="false">'How long do you think?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312657"><said direct="false">'I cannot tell. Several years may pass before I have my promotion. It may be that I shall not see that cheek in its fresh bloom again, but I shall find the same Laura that I left, the same in love, and strength, and trust.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312658"><said direct="true">'Ah! I shall grow faded and grey, and you will be a sun-burnt old soldier,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, smiling, and looking half sadly, half proudly, up to his noble features; 'but hearts don't change like faces!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312659"><said direct="false">After they came near the house, they walked up and down the lane for a long time, for Philip avoided a less public path, in order to keep up his delusion that he was doing nothing in an underhand way. It grew dark, and the fog thickened, straightening Laura's auburn ringlets, and hanging in dew-drops on Philip's rough coat, but little recked they; it was such an hour as they had never enjoyed before. Philip had never so laid himself open, or assured her so earnestly of the force of his affection; and her thrills of ecstacy overcame the desolate expectation of his departure, and made her sensible of strength to bear seven, ten, twenty years of loneliness and apparent neglect. She knew him, and he would never fail her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312660"><said direct="false">Yet, when at last they went in-doors, and Amy followed her to her room, wondering to find her so wet, and so late, who could have seen the two sisters without reading greater peace and serenity in the face of the younger.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312661"><said direct="false">Philip felt an elder brother's interest for 'poor little Amy.' He did not see much of her; but he compassionated her as a victim to her mother's imprudence, hoping she would soon be weaned from her attachment. He thought her a good patient little thing, so soft and gentle as probably not to have the strength and depth that would make the love incurable; and the better he liked her, the more unfit he thought her for Guy. It would have been uniting a dove and a tiger; and his only fear was, that when he was no longer at hand, Mr. Edmonstone's weak good nature might be prevailed on to sacrifice her. He did his best for her protection, by making his uncle express a resolution never to admit Guy into his family again, unless the accusation of gambling was completely disproved.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312662"><said direct="false">The last morning came, and Philip went to take leave of Charles. Poor Charles was feebler by this time, and too much subdued by pain and languor to receive him as at first, but the spirit was the same; and when Philip wished him good bye, saying he hoped soon to hear he was better, he returned for answer,</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312663"><said direct="false">'Good bye, Philip, I hope soon to hear you are better. I had rather have my hip than your mind.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312664"><said direct="false">He was in no condition to be answered, and Philip repeated his good bye, little thinking how they were to meet again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312665"><said direct="false">The others were assembled in the hall. His aunt's eyes were full of tears, for she loved him dearly, her brother's only son, early left motherless, whom she had regarded like her own child, and who had so nobly fulfilled all the fondest hopes. All his overbearing ways and uncalled-for interference were forgotten, and her voice gave way as she embraced him, saying,</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312666"><said direct="false">'God bless you, Philip, wherever you may be. We shall miss you very much!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312667"><said direct="false">Little Amy's hand was put into his, and he squeezed it kindly; but she could hardly speak her 'good bye' for the tears that came, because she was grieved not to feel more sorry that her highly esteemed cousin, so kind and condescending to her, was going away for so very long a time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312668"><said direct="true">'Good bye, Philip,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte I shall be quite grown up by the time you come home.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312669"><said direct="true">'Don'</said><said direct="false">t make such uncivil auguries, Puss,' said her father; but Philip heard her not, for he was holding Laura's hand in a grasp that seemed as if it never would unclose.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312670"><said direct="false">Williams.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312671"><said direct="false">After his last interview with Philip, Guy returned to his rooms to force himself into occupation till his cousin should come to acknowledge that here, at least, there was nothing amiss. He trusted that when it was proved all was right in this quarter, the prejudice with regard to the other might be diminished, though his hopes were lower since he had found out the real grounds of the accusation, reflecting that he should never be able to explain without betraying his uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312672"><said direct="false">He waited in vain. The hour passed at which Philip's coming was possible; Guy was disappointed, but looked for a letter; but post after post failed to bring him one. Perhaps Philip would write from Hollywell, or else Mr. Edmonstone would write, or at least he was sure that Charles would write—Charles, whose confidence and sympathy, expressed in almost daily letters, had been such a comfort. But not a line came. He reviewed in memory his last letter to Charles, wondering whether it could have offended him; but it did not seem possible; he thought over all that Philip could have learnt in his visit, to see if it could by any means have been turned to his disadvantage. But he knew he had done nothing to which blame could be attached; he had never infringed the rules of college discipline; and though still backward, and unlikely to distinguish himself, he believed that was the worst likely to have been said of him. He only wished his true character was as good as what would be reported of him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312673"><said direct="false">As he thought and wondered, he grew more and more restless and unhappy. He could imagine no reason for the silence, unless Mr. Edmonstone had absolutely forbidden any intercourse, and it did not seem probable that he would issue any commands in a manner to bind a grown-up son, more especially as there had been no attempt at communication with Amy. It was terrible thus, without warning, to be cut off from her, and all besides that he loved. As long as Charles wrote, he fancied her sitting by, perhaps sealing the letter, and he could even tell by the kind of paper and envelope, whether they were sitting in the dressing-room or down-stairs; but now there was nothing, no assurance of sympathy, no word of kindness; they might all have given him up; those unhappy words were like a barrier, cutting off for ever from the happiness of which he had once had a glimpse. Was the Redclyffe doom of sin and sorrow really closing in upon him?</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312674"><said direct="false">If it had not been for chapel and study, he hardly knew how he should have got through that term; but as the end of it approached, a feverish impatience seized on him whenever the post came in, for a letter, if only to tell him not to come to Holywell. None came, and he saw nothing for it, but to go to Redclyffe; and if he dreaded seeing it in its altered state when his spirits were high and unbroken, how did he shrink from it now? He did, however, make up his mind, for he felt that his reluctance almost wronged his own beloved home. Harry Graham wanted to persuade him to come and spend Christmas at his home, with his lively family, but Guy felt as if gaiety was not for him, even if he could enjoy it. He did not wish to drown his present feelings, and steadily, though gratefully, refused this, as well as one or two other friendly invitations.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312675"><said direct="false">After lingering in vain till the last day of term, he wrote to desire that his own room and the library might be made ready for him, and that 'something' might be sent to meet him at Moorworth.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312676"><said direct="false">Railroads had came a step nearer, even to his remote corner of the world, in the course of the last three years, but there were still thirty miles of coach beyond, and these lay through a part of the country he had never seen before. It was for the most part bleak, dreary moor, such as, under the cold grey wintry sky, presented nothing to rouse him from his musings on the welcome he might have been at that very moment receiving at Hollywell.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312677"><said direct="false">A sudden dip in the high ground made it necessary for the coach to put on the drag, and thus it slowly entered a village, which attracted attention from its wretched appearance. The cottages, of the rough stone of the country, were little better than hovels; slates were torn off, windows broken. Wild-looking, uncombed women, in garments of universal dirt colour, stood at the doors; ragged children ran and shrieked after the coach; the church had a hole in the roof, and stood tottering in spite of rude repairs; the churchyard was trodden down by cattle, and the whole place only resembled the pictures of Irish dilapidation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312678"><said direct="true">'What miserable place is this?'</said><said direct="false"> asked a passenger.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312679"><said direct="true">'Yes, that'</said><said direct="false">s what all gentlemen ask,' replied the coachman, 'and well you may. There's not a more noted place for thieves and vagabonds. They call it Coombe Prior.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312680"><said direct="false">Guy well knew the name, though he had never been there. It was a distant offset of his own property, and a horrible sense of responsibility for all the crime and misery there came over him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312681"><said direct="true">'Is there no one to look after it?'</said><said direct="false"> continued the traveller. 'No squire, no clergyman?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312682"><said direct="true">'A fox-hunting parson,'</said><said direct="false"> answered the coachman, 'who lives half-a-dozen miles off, and gallops over for the service.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312683"><said direct="false">Guy knew that the last presentation had been sold in the days of his grandfather's extravagance, and beheld another effect of ancestral sin.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312684"><said direct="false">'Do you know who is the owner of the place?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312685"><said direct="true">'Yes, sir, '</said><said direct="false">tis Sir Guy Morville. You have heard tell of the old Sir Guy Morville, for he made a deal of noise in the world.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312686"><said direct="false">'What? The noted—'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312687"><said direct="true">'I ought not to allow you to finish your sentence,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, very courteously, 'without telling you that I am his grandson.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312688"><said direct="true">'I beg your pardon!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed the traveller.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312689"><said direct="true">'Nay,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, with a smile, 'I only thought it was fair to tell you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312690"><said direct="true">'Sir Guy himself!'</said><said direct="false"> said the coachman, turning round, and touching his hat, anxious to do the honours of his coach. 'I have not seen you on this road before, sir, for I never forget a face; I hope you'll often be this way.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312691"><said direct="false">After a few more civilities, Guy was at liberty to attend to the fresh influx of sad musings on thoughtless waste, affecting not only the destiny of the individual himself, but whole generations besides. How many souls might it not have ruined? 'These sheep, what had they done?' His grandfather had repented, but who was to preach repentance unto these? He did not wonder now that his own hopes of happiness had been blighted; he only marvelled that a bright present or future had ever been his— While souls were wandering far and wide, And curses swarmed on every side.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312692"><said direct="false">The traveller was, meanwhile, observing the heir of Redclyffe, possessor of wealth and wide lands. Little did he guess how that bright-eyed youth looked upon his riches.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312693"><said direct="false">Miles were passed in one long melancholy musing, till Guy was roused by the sight of familiar scenes, and found himself rattling over the stones of the little borough of Moorworth, with the grey, large-windowed, old-fashioned houses, on each side, looking at him with friendly eyes. There, behind those limes cut out in arches, was the commercial school, where he had spent many an hour in construing with patient Mr. Potts; and though he had now a juster appreciation of his old master's erudition, which he had once thought so vast, he recollected with veneration his long and patient submission to an irksome, uncongenial life. Rumbling on, the coach was in the square market-place, the odd-looking octagon market-house in the middle, and the inn—the respectable old 'George'—with its long rank of stables and out-buildings forming one side. It was at this inn that Guy had been born, and the mistress having been the first person who had him in her arms, considered herself privileged to have a great affection for him, and had delighted in the greetings he always exchanged with her when he put up his pony at her stable, and went to his tutor.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312694"><said direct="false">There was a certainty of welcome here that cheered him, as he swung himself from the roof of the coach, lifted Bustle down, and called out to the bar-maid that he hoped Mrs. Lavers was well.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312695"><said direct="false">The next moment Mrs. Lavers was at the door herself, with her broad, good-humoured face, close cap, bright shawl, and black gown, just as Guy always recollected, and might, if he could, have recollected, when he was born. If she had any more guests she neither saw nor cared for them; her welcome was all for him; and he could not but smile and look cheerful, if only that he might not disappoint her, feeling in very truth cheered and gratified by her cordiality. If he was in a hurry, he would not show it; and he allowed her to seat him in her own peculiar abode, behind the glass-cases of tongue and cold chicken, told her he came from Oxford, admired her good fire, and warmed his hands over it, before he even asked if the 'something' had arrived which was to take him home.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312696"><said direct="false">It was coming to the door at the moment, and proved to be Mr. Markham's tall high-wheeled gig, drawn by the old white-faced chestnut, and driven by Markham himself—a short, sturdy, brown-red, honest-faced old man, with frosted hair and whiskers, an air more of a yeoman than of a lawyer; and though not precisely gentlemanlike, yet not ungentlemanlike, as there was no pretension about him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312697"><said direct="false">Guy darted out to meet him, and was warmly shaken by the hand, though the greeting was gruff.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312698"><said direct="true">'So, Sir Guy! how d'</said><said direct="false">ye do? I wonder what brings you here on such short notice? Good morning, Mrs. Lavers. Bad roads this winter.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312699"><said direct="false">'Good morning, Mr. Markham. It is a treat, indeed, to have Sir Guy here once more; so grown, too.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312700"><said direct="true">'Grown—hum?'</said><said direct="false"> said Markham, surveying him; 'I don't see it. He'll never be as tall as his father. Have you got your things, Sir Guy? Ay, that's the way,—care for nothing but the dog. Gone on by the coach, most likely.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312701"><said direct="false">They might have been, for aught Guy knew to the contrary, but Boots had been more attentive, and they were right. Mrs. Lavers begged he would walk in, and warm himself; but Markham answered—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312702"><said direct="false">'What do you say, Sir Guy? The road is shocking, and it will be as dark as a pit by the time we get home.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312703"><said direct="true">'Very well; we wont keep old Whiteface standing,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy. 'Good-bye, Mrs. Lavers; thank you. I shall see you again before long.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312704"><said direct="false">Before Markham had finished a short private growl on the shocking state of the Moorworth pavement, and a protest that somebody should be called over the coals, Guy began,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312705"><said direct="false">'What a horrible place Coombe Prior is!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312706"><said direct="true">'I only know I wish you had more such tenants as Todd,'</said><said direct="false"> was Markham's answer. 'Pays his rent to a day, and improves his land.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312707"><said direct="false">'But what sort of man is he?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312708"><said direct="false">'A capital farmer. A regular screw, I believe; but that is no concern of mine.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312709"><said direct="false">'There are all the cottages tumbling down.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312710"><said direct="true">'Ay? Are they? I shouldn'</said><said direct="false">t wonder, for they are all in his lease; and he would not lay out an unproductive farthing. And a precious bad lot they are there, too! There were actually three of them poaching in Cliffstone hanger this autumn; but we have them in jail. A pretty pass of impudence to be coming that distance to poach!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312711"><said direct="false">Guy used to be kindled into great wrath by the most distant hint of poachers; but now he cared for men, not for game, and instead of asking, as Markham expected, the particulars of their apprehension, continued—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312712"><said direct="false">'The clergyman is that Halroyd, is he not?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312713"><said direct="false">'Yes; every one knows what he is. I declare it went against me to take his offer for the living; but it could not be helped. Money must be had; but there! least said, soonest mended.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312714"><said direct="true">'We must mend it,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, so decidedly, that Markham looked at him in surprise.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312715"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t see what's to be done till Halroyd dies; and then you may give the living to whom you please. He lives so hard he can't last long, that is one comfort.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312716"><said direct="false">Guy sighed and pondered; and presently Markham resumed the conversation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312717"><said direct="true">'And what has brought you home at a moment'</said><said direct="false">s notice? You might as well have written two or three days before, at least.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312718"><said direct="true">'I was waiting, in hopes of going to Hollywell,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, sorrowfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312719"><said direct="true">'Well, and what is the matter? You have not been quarrelling with your guardian, I hope and trust? Going the old way, after all!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Markham, not in his usual gruff, grumbling note, but with real anxiety, and almost mournfulness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312720"><said direct="false">'He took up some unjust suspicion of me. I could not bear it patiently, and said something that has offended him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312721"><said direct="false">'Oh, Sir Guy! hot and fiery as ever. I always told you that hasty temper would be the ruin of you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312722"><said direct="true">'Too true!'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, so dejectedly, that the old man instantly grew kinder, and was displeased with Mr. Edmonstone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312723"><said direct="false">'What could he have taken into his head to suspect you of?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312724"><said direct="true">'Of gaming at St. Mildred'</said><said direct="false">s.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312725"><said direct="false">'You have not!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312726"><said direct="false">'Never!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312727"><said direct="false">'Then why does not he believe you?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312728"><said direct="true">'He thinks he has proof against me. I can'</said><said direct="false">t guess how he discovered it; but I was obliged to pay some money to a gambling sort of man, and he thinks I lost it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312729"><said direct="true">'Then why don'</said><said direct="false">t you show him your accounts?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312730"><said direct="false">'For one reason—because I have kept none.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312731"><said direct="false">As if it was an immense relief to his mind, Markham launched out into a discourse on the extreme folly, imprudence, and all other evils of such carelessness. He was so glad to find this was the worst, that his lecture lasted for two miles and a half, during which Guy, though attentive at first, had ample space for all the thrills of recognition at each well-known spot.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312732"><said direct="false">There was the long, green-wooded valley between the hills, where he had shot his first woodcock; there was the great stone on which he had broken his best knife in a fit of geological research; there was the pool where he used to skate: there the sudden break in the hills that gave the first view of the sea. He could not help springing up at the sight, pale, leaden, and misty as it was; and though Markham forthwith rebuked him for not listening, his heart was still beating as at the first sight of a dear old friend, when that peep was far behind. More black heaths, with stacks of peat and withered ferns. Guy was straining his eyes far off in the darkness to look for the smoke of the old keeper's cottage chimney, and could with difficulty refrain from interrupting Markham to ask after the old man.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312733"><said direct="false">Another long hill, and then began a descent into a rich valley, beautiful fields of young wheat, reddish soil, full of fatness, large spreading trees, with noble limbs, cottages, and cottage gardens, very unlike poor Coombe Prior; Markham's house,—a perfect little snuggery,—covered all over with choice climbing plants, the smart plastered doctor's house, the Morville Arms, looking honest and venerable, the church, with its disproportionately high tower, the parsonage rather hidden behind it; and, on the opposite side of the road, the park wall and the gate, where old Sarah stood, in an ecstasy of curtsies.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312734"><said direct="false">Guy jumped out to meet her, and to spare Whiteface; for there was sharp steep bit of hill, rising from the lodge, trying to horses, in spite of the road being cut out in long spirals. On he ran, leaving the road to Markham, straight up the high, steep, slippery green slope. He came in sight of the great dark-red sand stone pile of building; but he passed it, and ran on to where the ground rose on one side of it still more abruptly, and at the highest point was suddenly broken away and cut off into a perpendicular crag, descending in some parts sheer down to the sea, in others a little broken, and giving space for the growth of stunted brushwood. He stood at the highest point, where the precipice was most abrupt. The sea was dashing far beneath; the ripple, dash, and roar were in his ears once more; the wind—such wind as only blows over the sea—was breathing on his face; the broad, free horizon far before him, the field of waves, in gray and brown shade, indeed, but still his own beloved waves; the bay, shut in with rocks, and with black Shag Island and its train of rocks projecting far out to the west, and almost immediately beneath him, to the left, the little steep street of the fishing part of the village, nestled into the cove, which was formed by the mouth of a little mountain stream, and the dozen boats it could muster rocking on the water.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312735"><said direct="false">Guy stood and looked as if he could never cease looking, or enjoying the sea-air and salt breeze. It was real pleasure at first, for there were his home, his friends; and though there was a throb and tightness of heart at thinking how all was changed but such as this, and how all must change; how he had talked with Amy of this very thing, and had longed to have her standing beside him there; yet there was more of soothing than suffering in the sensation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312736"><said direct="false">So many thoughts rushed through his mind, that he fancied he had stood there a long time, when he turned and hastened down again, but he had been so rapid as to meet Markham before the servants had had time to miss him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312737"><said direct="false">The servants were indeed few. There was, alas! William of Deloraine, waiting to hold Whiteface; there was Arnaud, an old Swiss, first courier and then butler to old Sir Guy; there was Mrs. Drew, the housekeeper, also a very old servant; and these were all; but their welcome was of the heartiest, in feeling, if not in demonstration, as the gig went with an echoing, thundering sound under the deep archway that led into the paved quadrangle round which the house was built, that court where, as Philip had truly averred, the sun hardly ever shone, so high were the walls on each side.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312738"><said direct="false">Up the stone steps into the spacious dark hall, and into the large, gloomy library, partially lighted by a great wood fire, replying to Mrs. Drew's questions about his dinner and his room, and asking Markham to stay and dine with him, Guy at length found himself at home, in the very room where he had spent every evening of his boyhood, with the same green leather arm-chair, in the very place where his grandfather used to sit.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312739"><said direct="false">Markham consented to dine with him, and the evening was spent in talking over the news of Redclyffe. Markham spoke with much bitterness of the way in which Captain Morville had taken upon him; his looking into the accounts, though any one was welcome to examine them, was, he thought, scarcely becoming in so young a man,—the heir-at-law, too.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312740"><said direct="true">'He can'</said><said direct="false">t help doing minutely whatever he undertakes,' said Guy. 'If you had him here, you would never have to scold him like me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312741"><said direct="true">'Heaven forbid!'</said><said direct="false"> said Markham, hastily. 'I know the same place would not hold him and me long.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312742"><said direct="false">'You have told me nothing of our new vicar. How do you get on with him?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312743"><said direct="true">'None the better for that same Captain Morville,'</said><said direct="false"> replied Markham, plunging forthwith into his list of grievances, respecting which he was waging a petty warfare, in the belief that he was standing up for his master's rights.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312744"><said direct="false">Mr. Bernard, the former clergyman, had been a quiet, old-fashioned man, very kind-hearted, but not at all active, and things had gone on in a sleepy, droning, matter-of-fact way, which, Markham being used to, thought exactly what ought to be. Now, Mr. Ashford was an energetic person, desirous to do his utmost for the parish, and whatever he did was an offence to Markham, from the daily service, to the objecting to the men going out fishing on Sunday. He opposed every innovation with all his might, and Captain Morville's interference, which had borne Markham down with Mr. Edmonstone's authority, had only made him more determined not to bate an inch. He growled every time Guy was inclined to believe Mr. Ashford in the right, and brought out some fresh complaint. The grand controversy was at present about the school. There was a dame's school in the Cove, or fishing part of the parish, maintained at the expense of the estate, in a small cottage far from the church, and Mr. And Mrs. Ashford had fixed their eyes on a house in the village, and so near the church as to be very convenient for a Sunday-school. It only wanted to be floored, and to have a partition taken down, but to this Markham would not consent, treating it as a monstrous proposal to take away the school from old Jenny Robinson.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312745"><said direct="false">'I suppose Mr. Ashford meant to pension her off? said Guy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312746"><said direct="false">'He did say something about it; but who is to do it, I should like to know?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312747"><said direct="false">'We are, I suppose.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312748"><said direct="false">'Pay two schoolmistresses at once! One for doing nothing! A pretty tolerable proposal for Mr. Ashford to be making!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312749"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t see why. Of course it is my business.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312750"><said direct="true">'Besides, I don'</said><said direct="false">t see that she is not as fit to keep school as ever she was.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312751"><said direct="true">'That may well be,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, smiling. 'We never used to be noted for our learning.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312752"><said direct="true">'Don'</said><said direct="false">t you be for bringing new lights into the parish, Sir Guy, or we shall never have any more peace.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312753"><said direct="true">'I shall see about old Jenny,'</said><said direct="false"> answered Guy. 'As to the house, that must be done directly. Her cottage is not fit to keep school in.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312754"><said direct="false">Grunt, grunt; but though a very unbending viceroy, a must from the reigning baronet had a potent effect on Markham, whether it was for good or evil. He might grumble, but he never disobeyed, and the boy he was used to scold and order had found that Morville intonation of the must , which took away all idea of resistance. He still, however, remonstrated.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312755"><said direct="false">'As you please, Sir Guy, but we shall have the deer frightened, and the plantations cut to pieces, if the boys from the Cove are to be crossing the park.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312756"><said direct="true">'I'</said><said direct="false">ll be answerable for all the damage. If they are once properly spoken to, they will be on honour to behave well. I have seen a little of what a village school ought to be at East Hill, and I should like to see Redclyffe like it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312757"><said direct="false">Grunt again; and Guy found that to make Markham amiable, he must inquire after all his nephews and nieces.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312758"><said direct="false">All the evening he had much to occupy him, and the dreaded sense of solitude and bereavement did not come on till he had parted with Markham, and stood alone before the fire in the large, gloomy room, where the light of the lamp seemed absorbed in the darkness of the distant corners, and where he had scarcely been since the moment when he found his grandfather senseless in that very chair. How different had that room once been in his eyes, when his happy spirits defied every association of gloom, and the book-shelves, the carved chairs, the heavy dark-green curtains, and deep windows, were connected with merry freaks, earnest researches, delightful achievements or discoveries. How long ago that time seemed! and how changed was he!</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312759"><said direct="false">There was a certain tendency to melancholy in Guy's mind. High spirits, prosperity, and self-discipline, had kept it from developing itself until the beginning of his troubles, but since that time it had been gradually gaining ground, and this was a time of great suffering, as he stood alone in his forefathers' house, and felt himself, in his early youth, a doomed man, destined to bear the penalty of their crimes in the ruin of his dearest hopes, as if his heirloom of misery had but waited to seize on him till the very moment when it would give him the most to endure.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312760"><said direct="true">'But bear it I must and will!'</said><said direct="false"> said he, lifting his head from the carved chimney-piece, where he had been resting it. 'I have been in will a murderer myself, and what right have I to repine like the Israelites, with their self-justifying proverb? No; let me be thankful that I was not given up even then, but have been able to repent, and do a little better next time. It will be a blessing as yet ungranted to any of us, if indeed I should bear to the full the doom of sorrow, so that it may be vouchsafed me only to avoid actual guilt. Yes, Amy, your words are still with me,—'Sintram conquered his doom,'—and it was by following death! Welcome, then, whatever may be in store for me, were it even a long, cheerless life without you, Amy. There is another world!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312761"><said direct="false">With the energy of freshened resolution, he lighted his candle, and walked, with echoing steps, up the black oak staircase, along the broad gallery, up another flight, down another passage, to his own room. He had expressly written 'his own room,' and confirmed it on his arrival, or Mrs. Drew would have lodged him as she thought more suitably for the master of the house. Nothing had been done to alter its old, familiar aspect, except lighting a fire, which he had never seen there before. There were all his boyish treasures, his bows and arrows, his collection of birds' wings, his wonderful weapons and contrivances, from his fire-balloon down to the wren's-egg, all just as he left them, their good condition attesting the care that Mrs. Drew had taken for his sake.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312762"><said direct="false">He renewed his acquaintance with them, with a sort of regretful affection and superiority; but there was a refreshment in these old memories which aided the new feeling of life imparted to him by his resolution to bear. Nor had he only to bear, he had also to do; and before the late hour at which he fell asleep, he had made up his mind what was the first step to be taken about Coombe Priory, and had remembered with rejoicing, that whereas he had regretted leaving the chapel at college which had so comforted and helped him, there was now daily service at Redclyffe Church. The last thing in his mind, before reflection was lost in sleep, was this stanza,— 'Gales from heaven, if so He will,    Sweeter melodies may wake On the lonely mountain rill    Than the meeting waters wake. Who hath the Father and the Son, May be left, but not alone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312763"><said direct="false">Longfellow.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312764"><said direct="false">Mr. Ashford was a connexion of Lady Thorndale's, and it was about a year since the living of Redclyffe had been presented to him. Mr. and Mrs. Ashford were of course anxious to learn all they could about their young squire, on whom the welfare of the parish depended, even more than in most cases, as the whole was his property. Their expectations were not raised by Mr. Markham's strenuous opposition to all their projects, and his constant appeals to the name of 'Sir Guy;' but, on the other hand, they were pleased by the strong feeling of affection that all the villagers manifested for their landlord.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312765"><said direct="false">The inhabitants of Redclyffe were a primitive race, almost all related to each other, rough and ignorant, and with a very strong feudal feeling for 'Sir Guy,' who was king, state, supreme authority, in their eyes; and Mrs. Ashford further found that 'Master Morville,' as the old women called him in his individual character, was regarded by them with great personal affection.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312766"><said direct="false">On the occasion when Captain Morville came to Redclyffe, and left James Thorndale to spend a couple of hours at the parsonage, they interrogated the latter anxiously on his acquaintance with Sir Guy. He had not the least idea of creating prejudice, indeed, he liked him as a companion, but he saw everything through the medium of his friend, and spoke something to this effect: He was very agreable; they would like his manners; he was tolerably clever, but not to be named in the same day with his cousin for abilities, far less in appearance. Very pleasant, generally liked, decidedly a taking man; but there was some cloud over him just now—debts, probably. Morville had been obliged to go to Oxford about it; but Mr. Thorndale did not profess to understand it, as of course Morville said as little of it as he could. Thereupon all began to admire the aforesaid Morville, already known by report, and whose fine countenance and sensible conversation confirmed all that had been said of him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312767"><said direct="false">And as, after his interference, Mr. Markham's opposition became surly, as well as sturdy, and Sir Guy's name was sure to stand arrayed against them whichever way they turned, the younger part of the family learnt to regard him somewhat in the light of an enemy, and their elders awaited his majority with more of fear than of hope.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312768"><said direct="true">'Mamma!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Edward Ashford, rushing in, so as to bring the first news to his mother, who had not been to the early service, 'I do believe Sir Guy is come!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312769"><said direct="true">'Sir Guy was at church!'</said><said direct="false"> shouted Robert, almost at the same moment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312770"><said direct="false">Mr. Ashford confirmed the intelligence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312771"><said direct="false">'I saw him speaking, after church, to some of the old men, so afterwards I went to ask old John Barton, and found him with tears in his eyes, positively trembling with delight, for he said he never thought to have heard his cheery voice again, and that he was coming down by-and-bye to see the last letter from Ben, at sea.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312772"><said direct="false">'That is very nice! Shall you call?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312773"><said direct="false">'Yes. Even if he is only here for a day or two, it will be better to have made the acquaintance.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312774"><said direct="false">Mr. Ashford went to the park at two in the afternoon, and did not return till near four.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312775"><said direct="true">'Well,'</said><said direct="false"> said he, 'it is as James Thorndale says, there is something very prepossessing about him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312776"><said direct="false">'Have you been there all this time?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312777"><said direct="false">'Yes. He was not at home, so I left my card, and was coming away, when I met him at the turn leading to the Cove. He need not have seen me unless he had liked, but he came up in a good-natured cordial way, and thanked me for coming to call.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312778"><said direct="false">'Is he like his cousin?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312779"><said direct="false">'Not in the least; not nearly so tall or so handsome, but with a very pleasant face, and seeming made up of activity, very slight, as if he was all bone and sinew. He said he was going to see the Christmas ox at the farm, and asked me to come with him. Presently we came to a high gate, locked up. He was over it in an instant, begged me to wait while he ran on to the farm for the key, and was back in a second with it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312780"><said direct="false">'Did he enter on any of the disputed subjects?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312781"><said direct="false">'He began himself about the school, saying the house should be altered directly; and talked over the whole matter very satisfactorily; undertook himself to speak to Jenny Robinson; and was very glad to hear you meant her still to keep the infants at the Cove; so I hope that matter is in a right train.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312782"><said direct="false">'If Mr. Markham will but let him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312783"><said direct="false">'O, he is king or more here! We met Markham at the farm; and the first thing, after looking at the cattle, Sir Guy found some planks lying about, and said they were the very thing for flooring the school. Markham mentioned some barn they were intended for, but Sir Guy said the school must be attended to at once, and went with us to look at it. That was what kept me so long, measuring and calculating, and I hope it may be begun in a week.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312784"><said direct="false">'This is delightful! What more could we wish?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312785"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t think he will give trouble in parish matters, and in personal intercourse he will be sure to be most agreeable. I wish I knew there was nothing amiss. It seems strange for him to come here for the vacation, instead of going to his guardian's as usual, and altogether he had an air of sadness and depression, not like a youth, especially such an active one. I am afraid something is wrong; those engaging people are often unstable. One thing I forgot to tell you. We were walking through that belt of trees on the east side of the hill, when he suddenly called out to ask how came the old ash-tree to be marked. Markham answered in his gruff way it was not his doing, but the Captain's. He turned crimson, and began some angry exclamation; but as Markham was going on to tell something else about it, he stopped him short, saying, 'Never mind! I dare say it's all right. I don't want to hear any more!' and I don't think he spoke much again till we got into the village. I am afraid there is some misunderstanding between the cousins.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312786"><said direct="false">'Or more likely Mr. Markham is teaching him some jealousy of his heir. We could not expect two Captain Morvilles in one family, and I am glad it is no worse.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312787"><said direct="false">All that the Ashfords further saw of their young baronet made an impression in his favour; every difficulty raised by the steward disappeared; their plans were forwarded, and they heard of little but his good nature to the poor people; but still they did not know how far to trust these appearances, and did not yet venture to form an opinion on him, or enter into intimacy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312788"><said direct="true">'So the singers will not come to us on Christmas Eve, because they say they must go to the Park,'</said><said direct="false"> said Edward, rather savagely.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312789"><said direct="true">'I was thinking,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Ashford, 'how forlorn it will be for that poor youth to spend his Christmas day alone, in that great house. Don't you think we might ask him to dinner?'</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG185312421"><said direct="false">'You would not have had him be silent?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312422"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t know,' said Amy, sadly. 'No; he should have done something, but he might have done it more kindly.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312423"><said direct="false">Laura endeavoured to persuade her that nothing could have been more kind and judicious, and Amy sat dejectedly owning the good intention, and soothed by the affection of her family; but with the bitter suffering of her heart unallayed, with all her fond, tender feelings torn at the thought of what Guy must be enduring, and with the pain of knowing it was her father's work. She had one comfort, in the certainty that Guy would bear it nobly. She was happy to find her confidence confirmed by her mother and Charles; and one thing she thought she need not give up, though she might no longer think of him as her lover, she might be his Verena still, whether he knew it or not. It could not be wrong to remember any one in her prayers, and to ask that he might not be led into temptation, but have strength to abide patiently. That helped her to feel that he was in the hands of One to whom the secrets of all hearts are known; and a line of poetry seemed to be whispered in her ears, in his own sweet tones,— 'Wait, and the cloud shall roll away.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312424"><said direct="false">So, after the first day, she went on pretty well. She was, indeed, silent and grave, and no longer the sunbeam of Hollywell; but she took her share in what was passing, and a common observer would hardly have remarked the submissive melancholy of her manner. Her father was very affectionate, and often called her his jewel of good girls; but he was too much afraid of women's tears to talk to her about Guy, he left that to her mother; and Mrs. Edmonstone, having seen her submit to her father's will, was unwilling to say more.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312425"><said direct="false">She doubted whether it was judicious to encourage her in dwelling on Guy; for, even supposing his character cleared, they had offended him deeply, and released him from any engagement to her, so that there was nothing to prevent him from forming an attachment elsewhere. Mrs. Edmonstone did not think he would; but it was better to say nothing about him, lest she should not speak prudently, and only keep up the subject in Amy's mind.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312426"><said direct="false">Charles stormed and wrangled, told Mr. Edmonstone 'he was breaking his daughter's heart, that was all;' and talked of unfairness and injustice, till Mr. Edmonstone vowed it was beyond all bearing, that his own son should call him a tyrant, and accused Guy of destroying all peace in his family.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312427"><said direct="false">The replies to the letters came; some thought them satisfactory, and the others wondered that they thought so. Mr. Wellwood gave the highest character of his pupil, and could not imagine how any irregularities could be laid to his charge; but when asked in plain terms how he disposed of his time, could only answer in general, that he had friends and engagements of his own at St. Mildred's and its neighbourhood, and had been several times at Mrs. Henley's and at Colonel Harewood's. The latter place, unfortunately, was the very object of Philip's suspicions; and thus the letter was anything but an exculpation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312428"><said direct="false">Guy wrote to Charles in the fulness of his heart, expressing gratitude for his confidence and sympathy. He again begged for the supposed evidence of his misconduct, declaring he could explain it, whatever it might be, and proceeded to utter deep regrets for his hasty expressions.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312429"><said direct="true">'I do not know what I may have said,'</said><said direct="false"> he wrote; 'I have no doubt it was unpardonable, for I am sure my feelings were so, and that I deserve whatever I have brought on myself. I can only submit to Mr. Edmonstone's sentence, and trust that time will bring to his knowledge that I am innocent of what I am accused of. He has every right to be displeased with me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312430"><said direct="false">Charles pronounced this to be only Guy's way of abusing himself; but his father saw in it a disguised admission of guilt. It was thought, also, to be a bad sign that Guy intended to remain at Southmoor till the end of the vacation, though Charles argued that he must be somewhere; and if they wished to keep him out of mischief, why exile him from Hollywell? He would hardly listen to his mother's representation, that on Amy's account, it would not be right to have him there till the mystery was cleared up.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312431"><said direct="false">He tried to stir his father up to go and see Guy at St. Mildred's, and investigate matters for himself; but, though Mr. Edmonstone would have liked the appearance of being important, this failed, because Philip declared it to be unadvisable, knowing that it would be no investigation at all, and that his uncle would be talked over directly. Next, Charles would have persuaded Philip himself to go, but the arrangements about his leave did not make this convenient; and it was put off till he should pay his farewell visit to his sister, in October. Lastly, Charles wrote to Mrs. Henley, entreating her to give him some information about this mysterious evidence which was wanting; but her reply was a complete 'set down' for interference in a matter with which he had no concern.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312432"><said direct="false">He was very angry. In fact, the post seldom came in without occasioning a fresh dispute, which only had the effect of keeping up the heat of Mr. Edmonstone's displeasure, and making the whole house uncomfortable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312433"><said direct="false">Fretfulness and ill-humour seemed to have taken possession of Charles and his father. Such a state of things had not prevailed since Guy's arrival; Hollywell was hardly like the same house; Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura could do nothing without being grumbled at or scolded by one or other of the gentlemen; even Amy now and then came in for a little petulance on her father's part, and Charles could not always forgive her for saying, in her mournful, submissive tone,—'It is of no use to talk about it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312434"><said direct="false">Æschylus , ( Anstice's Translation.)</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312435"><said direct="false">Guy , in the meantime, was enduring the storm in loneliness, for he was unwilling to explain the cause of his trouble to his companions. The only occasion of the suspicions, which he could think of, was his request for the sum of money; and this he could not mention to Mr. Wellwood, nor was he inclined to make confidants of his other companions, though pleasant, right-minded youths.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312436"><said direct="false">He had only announced that he had had a letter which had grieved him considerably, but of which he could not mention the contents; and, as Harry Graham, who knew something of the Broadstone neighbourhood, had picked up a report that Sir Guy Morville was to marry Lady Eveleen de Courcy, there was an idea among the party that there was some trouble in the way of his attachment. He had once before been made, by some joke, to colour and look conscious; and now this protected him from inconvenient questions, and accounted for his depression. He was like what he had been on first coming to Hollywell—grave and silent, falling into reveries when others were talking, and much given to long, lonely wanderings. Accustomed as he had been in boyhood to a solitary life in beautiful scenery, there was something in a fine landscape that was to him like a friend and companion; and he sometimes felt that it would have been worse if he had been in a dull, uniform country, instead of among mountain peaks and broad, wooded valleys. Working hard, too, helped him not a little, and conic sections served him almost as well as they served Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312437"><said direct="false">A more real help was the neighbourhood of Stylehurst. On the first Sunday after receiving Mr. Edmonstone's letter, he went to church there, instead of with the others, to St. Mildred's. They thought it was for the sake of the solitary walk; but he had other reasons for the preference. In the first place, it was a Communion Sunday, and in the next, he could feel more kindly towards Philip there, and he knew he needed all that could strengthen such a disposition.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312438"><said direct="false">Many a question did he ask himself, to certify whether he wilfully entertained malice, or hatred, or any uncharitableness. It was a long, difficult examination; but at its close, he felt convinced that, if such passions knocked at the door of his heart, it was not at his own summons, and that he drove them away without listening to them. And surely he might approach to gain the best aid in that battle, especially as he was certain of his strong and deep repentance for his fit of passion, and longing earnestly for the pledge of forgiveness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312439"><said direct="false">The pardon and peace he sought came to him, and in such sort that the comfort of that day, when fresh from the first shock, and waiting in suspense for some new blow, was such as never to be forgotten. They linked themselves with the grave shade of the clustered grey columns, and the angel heads on the roof of that old church; with the long grass and tall yellow mullens among its churchyard graves, and with the tints of the elm-trees that closed it in, their leaves in masses either of green or yellow, and opening here and there to show the purple hills beyond.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312440"><said direct="false">He wandered in the churchyard between the services. All enmity to Philip was absent now; and he felt as if it would hardly return when he stood by the graves of the Archdeacon and of the two Frances Morvilles, and thought what that spot was to his cousin. There were a few flowers planted round Mrs. Morville's grave, but they showed that they had long been neglected, and no such signs of care marked her daughter Fanny's. And when Guy further thought of Mrs. Henley, and recollected how Philip had sacrificed all his cherished prospects and hopes of distinction, and embraced an irksome profession, for the sake of these two sisters, he did not find it difficult to excuse the sternness, severity, and distrust which were an evidence how acutely a warm heart had suffered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312441"><said direct="false">Though he suffered cruelly from being cut off from Amy, yet his reverence for her helped him to submit. He had always felt as if she was too far above him; and though he had, beyond his hopes, been allowed to aspire to the thought of her, it was on trial, and his failure, his return to his old evil passions, had sunk him beneath her. He shuddered to think of her being united to anything so unlike herself, and which might cause her so much misery; it was wretchedness to think that even now she might be suffering for him; and yet not for worlds would he have lost the belief that she was so feeling, or the remembrance of the looks which had shone on him so sweetly and timidly as she sat at her mother's feet; though that remembrance was only another form of misery. But Amy would be tranquil, pure and good, whatever became of him, and he should always be able to think of her, looking like one of those peaceful spirits, with bending head, folded hands, and a star on its brow, in the Paradiso of Flaxman. Her serenity would be untouched; and though she might be lost to him, he could still be content while he could look up at it through his turbid life. Better she were lost to him than that her peace should be injured.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312442"><said direct="false">He still, of course, earnestly longed to prove his innocence, though his hopes lessened; for, as long as the evidence was withheld, he had no chance. After writing as strongly as he could, he could do no more except watch for something that might unravel the mystery; and Charles's warm sympathy and readiness to assist him were a great comfort.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312443"><said direct="false">He had not seen his uncle again; perhaps Sebastian was ashamed to meet him after their last encounter, and was still absent on his engagement; but the wife and child were still at St. Mildred's, and one afternoon, when Guy had rather unwillingly gone thither with Mr. Wellwood, he saw Mrs. Dixon sitting on one of the benches which were placed on the paths cut out on the side of the hill, looking very smart and smiling, among several persons of her own class.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312444"><said direct="false">To be ashamed to recognise her was a weakness beneath him; he spoke to her, and was leaving her, pluming herself on his notice, when he saw little Marianne's blue eyes fixed wistfully upon him, and held out his hand to her. She ran up to him joyfully, and he led her a few steps from her mother's party. 'Well, little one, how are you? I have your piece of spar quite safe. Have you said how d'ye do to Bustle?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312445"><said direct="true">'Bustle! Bustle!'</said><said direct="false"> called the soft voice; but it needed a whistle from his master to bring him to be caressed by the little girl.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312446"><said direct="false">'Have you been taking any more pleasant walks?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312447"><said direct="false">'Oh yes. We have been all round these pretty paths. And I should like to get to the top of this great high hill, and see all round; but mamma says she has got a bone in her leg, and cannot go.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312448"><said direct="false">'Do you think mamma would give you leave to go up with me? Should you like it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312449"><said direct="false">She coloured all over; too happy even to thank him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312450"><said direct="true">'Then,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, to his tutor, 'I will meet you here when you have done your business in the town, in an hour or so. Poor little thing, she has not many pleasures.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312451"><said direct="false">Mrs. Dixon made no difficulty, and was so profuse in thanks that Guy got out of her way as fast as he could, and was soon on the soft thymy grass of the hill side, the little girl frisking about him in great delight, playing with Bustle, and chattering merrily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312452"><said direct="false">Little Marianne was a delicate child, and her frolics did not last long. As the ascent became steeper, her breath grew shorter, and she toiled on in a resolute uncomplaining manner after his long, vigorous steps, till he looked round, and seeing her panting far behind, turned to help her, lead her, and carry her till the top was achieved, and the little girl stood on the topmost stone, gazing round at the broad sunny landscape, with the soft green meadows, the harvest fields, the woods in their gorgeous autumn raiment, and the moorland on the other side, with its other peaks and cairns, brown with withered bracken, and shadowed in moving patches by the floating clouds. The exhilarating wind brought a colour into her pale cheeks, and her flossy curls were blowing over her face.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312453"><said direct="false">He watched her in silence, pleased and curious to observe how so beautiful a scene struck the childish eye of the little Londoner. The first thing she said, after three or four minutes' contemplation—a long time for such a child—was, 'Oh! I never saw any thing so pretty!' then presently after, 'oh! I wish little brother Felix was here!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312454"><said direct="true">'This is a pleasant place to think about your little brother,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, kindly; and she looked up in his face, and exclaimed, 'Oh! do you know about Felix?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312455"><said direct="true">'You shall tell me,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy. 'Here, sit on my knee, and rest after your scramble.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312456"><said direct="true">'Mamma never lets me talk of Felix, because it makes her cry,'</said><said direct="false"> said Marianne; 'but I wish it sometimes.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312457"><said direct="false">Her little heart was soon open. It appeared that Felix was the last who had died, the nearest in age to Marianne, and her favourite playfellow. She told of some of their sports in their London home, speaking of them with eagerness and fondness that showed what joys they had been, though to Guy they seemed but the very proof of dreariness and dinginess. She talked of walks to school when Felix would tell what he would do when he was a man, and how he took care of her at the crossings, and how rude boys used to drive them, and how they would look in at the shop windows and settle what they would buy if they were rich. Then she talked of his being ill—ill so very long, how he sat in his little chair, and could not play, and then always lay in bed, and she liked to sit by him there; but at last he died, and they carried him away in a great black coffin, and he would never come back again. But it was so dull now, there was no one to play with her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312458"><said direct="false">Though the little girl did not cry, she looked very mournful, and Guy tried to comfort her, but she did not understand him. 'Going to heaven' only conveyed to her a notion of death and separation; and this phrase, together with a vague idea who had made her, and that she ought to be good, seemed to be the extent of the poor child's religious knowledge. She hardly ever had been at church; and though she had read one or two Bible stories, it seemed to have been from their having been used as lessons at school. She had a dim notion that good people read the Bible, and there was one on the little table at home, with the shell-turkey-cock standing upon it, and mamma read it when Felix died; but it was a big book, and the shell-turkey-cock always stood upon it; in short, it seemed only connected with mamma's tears and the loss of her brother.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312459"><said direct="false">Guy was very much shocked, and so deep in thought that he could hardly talk to the child in their progress down the hill; but she was just so tired as to be inclined to silence, and quite happy clinging to his hand, till he delivered her over to her mother at the foot of the hill, and went to join his tutor, at the place appointed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312460"><said direct="true">'Wellwood,'</said><said direct="false"> said he, breaking silence, when they had walked about half way back to the farm, 'do you think your cousin would do me a great kindness? You saw that child? Well, if the parents' consent, it would be the greatest charity on earth if Miss Wellwood would receive her into her school.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312461"><said direct="false">'On what terms? What sort of an education is she to have?</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312462"><said direct="true">'The chief thing she wants is to be taught Christianity, poor child; the rest Miss Wellwood may settle. She is my first cousin. I don'</said><said direct="false">t know whether you are acquainted with our family history?' and he went on to explain as much as was needful. It ended in a resolution that if Miss Wellwood would undertake the charge, the proposal should be made to Mrs. Dixon.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312463"><said direct="false">It was a way of assisting his relations likely to do real good, and on the other hand, he would be able, under colour of the payment for the child, to further Miss Wellwood's schemes, and give her the interest of the thousand pounds, until his five and twentieth year might put his property in his own power.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312464"><said direct="false">Miss Wellwood readily consented, much pleased with the simplicity and absence of false shame he showed in the whole transaction, and very anxious for the good of a child in a class so difficult to reach. He next went to Mrs. Dixon, expecting more difficulty with her, but he found none. She thought it better Marianne should live at St. Mildred's than die in London, and was ready to catch at the prospect of her being fitted for a governess. Indeed, she was so strongly persuaded that the rich cousin might make Marianne's fortune, that she would have been very unwilling to interfere with the fancy he had taken for her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312465"><said direct="false">Little Marianne was divided between fear of leaving mamma and liking for St. Mildred's but her first interview with Miss Wellwood, and Miss Jane's showing her a little white bed, quite turned the scale in their favour. Before the time came for Guy's return to Oxford, he had seen her settled, heard her own account of her happy life, and had listened to Miss Jane Wellwood's delight in her sweet temper and good disposition.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312466"><said direct="false">Those thousand pounds; Guy considered again and again whether he could explain their destination, and whether this would clear him. It seemed to him only a minor charge, and besides his repugnance to mention such a design, he saw too many obstacles in his way. Captain Morville and his sister were the very persons from whom Miss Wellwood's project was to be kept secret. Besides, what would be gained? It was evident that Guy's own assertions were doubted, and he could bring no confirmation of them; he had never spoken of his intention to his tutor, and Mr. Wellwood could, therefore, say nothing in his favour. If Mr. Edmonstone alone had been concerned, or if this had been the only accusation, Guy might have tried to explain it; but with Philip he knew it would be useless, and therefore would not enter on the subject. He could only wait patiently.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312467"><said direct="false">Tennyson.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312468"><said direct="false">Guy had been about a week at Oxford, when one evening, as he was sitting alone in his rooms, he received an unexpected visit from Captain Morviller. He was glad, for he thought a personal interview would remove all misconstructions, and held out his hand cordially, saying:</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312469"><said direct="false">'You here, Philip? When did you come?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312470"><said direct="true">'Half an hour ago. I am on my way to spend a week with the Thorndales. I go on to-morrow to my sister'</said><said direct="false">s.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312471"><said direct="false">While speaking, Philip was surveying the apartment, for he held that a man's room is generally an indication of his disposition, and assuredly there was a great deal of character in his own, with the scrupulous neatness and fastidious taste of its arrangements. Here, he thought, he could not fail to see traces of his cousin's habits, but he was obliged to confess to himself that there was very little to guide him. The furniture was strictly as its former occupant had left it, only rather the worse for wear, and far from being in order. The chairs were so heaped with books and papers,that Guy hat to make a clearance of one before his visitor could sit down; but there was nothing else to complain of, not even a trace of cigars; but knowing him to be a great reader and lover of accomplishments, Philip wondered that the only decorations were Lauras drawing of Sintram, and a little print of Redclyffe, and the books were chiefly such as were wanted for his studies; the few others having for the most part the air of old library books, as if he had sent for them form Redclyffe. Was this another proof that he had some way of frittering away his money with nothing to show for it? A Sophocles and a lexicon were open before him on the table, and a blotting book, which he closed, but not before Philip had caught sight of what looked like verses.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312472"><said direct="false">Neither did his countenance answer Philip's expectations. It had not his usual bright lively expression; there was a sadness which made his smile like a gleam on a showery day, instead of constant sunshine; but there was neither embarrassment nor defiance, and the gleamlike smile was there, as, with a frank, confiding tone, he said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312473"><said direct="false">'This is very kind of you, to come and see what you can do for me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312474"><said direct="false">Philip was by no means prepared to be thus met halfway, but he thought Guy wanted to secure him as an intercessor, and hardened himself into righteous severity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312475"><said direct="false">'No one can be more willing to help you than I, but you must, in the first place, help yourself.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312476"><said direct="false">Instantly, the sedate measured tone made Guy's heart and head throb with impatience, awakening all the former memories so hardly battled down; but with the impulse of anger came the thought, 'Here it is again! If I don't keep it down now, I am undone! The enemy will seize me again!' He forced himself not to interrupt, while Philip went calmly on.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312477"><said direct="false">'While you are open, nothing can be done.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312478"><said direct="true">'My only wish, my only desire, is to be open,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, speaking fast and low, and repressing the feeling, which, nevertheless, affected his voice; 'but the opportunity of explanation has never been given me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312479"><said direct="false">'You need complain of that no longer. I am here to convey to my uncle any explanation you may wish to address to him. I will do my best to induce him to attend to it favourably, but he is deeply offended and hurt by what has passed.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312480"><said direct="true">'I know, I know,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, colouring deeply, and all irritation disappearing from voice and manner; 'I know there is no excuse for me. I can only repeat that I am heartily sorry for whatever I may have said, either of him or of you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312481"><said direct="true">'Of course,'</said><said direct="false"> returned Philip, 'I should never think of resenting what you may have said in a moment of irritation, especially as you express regret for it. Consider it as entirely overlooked on my part.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312482"><said direct="false">Guy was nearly choked in uttering a 'Thank you,' which did not sound, after all, much like acceptance of forgiveness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312483"><said direct="true">'Now to the real matter at issue,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip; 'the application for the money, which so amazed Mr. Edmonstone.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312484"><said direct="true">'I do not see that it is the point,'</said><said direct="false"> siad Guy; 'I wanted it for a scheme of my own; he did not think fit to let me have it, so there is an end of the matter.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312485"><said direct="false">'Mr. Edmonstone does not think so. He wishes to be convinced that you have not spent it beforehand.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312486"><said direct="true">'What would you have beyond my word and honour that I have not?'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Guy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312487"><said direct="true">'Far be it from me to say that he doubts it,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip; and as at those words the flash of the Morville eye darted lightning, he expected that the next moment, 'Do you?' would be thundered forth, and he could not, with truth, answer 'No;' but it was one of his maxims that a man need never be forced into an open quarrel, and he tranquilly continued: 'but it is better not to depend entirely on assertion. Why do you not bring him full proofs of your good intention, and thus restore yourself to his confidence?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312488"><said direct="false">'I have said that I am bound not to mention the purpose.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312489"><said direct="true">'Unfortunate!'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip; then, while Guy bit his lip till it bled, the pain really a relief, by giving some vent to his anger at the implied doubt, he went on: 'If it is impossible to clear this up, the next advice I would give is, that you should show what your expenditure has been; lay your accounts before him, and let them justify you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312490"><said direct="false">Most people would have resented this as an impertinent proposal, were it only that doing so would have served to conceal the awkward fact that the accounts had not been kept at all. Guy had never been taught to regard exactness in this respect as a duty, had no natural taste for precision, and did not feel responsible to any person; nor, if he had kept any, could he have shown them, without exposing his uncle. To refuse would, however, be a subterfuge, and after a moment, he made an effort, and confessed he had none to show; though he knew Philip would despise him for it as a fool, and probably take it as positive evidence against him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312491"><said direct="false">It would have been more bearable if Philip would but have said 'How foolish,' instead of drily repeating, 'unfortunate!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312492"><said direct="false">After a pause, during which Guy was not sufficiently master of himself to speak, Philip added— 'Then this matter of the thousand pounds is to be passed over? You have no explanation to offer?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312493"><said direct="true">'No:'</said><said direct="false"> and again he paused. 'When my word is not accepted, I have no more to say. But this is not the point. What I would know is, what are the calumnies that accuse me of having gamed? If you really wish to do me a service, you will give me an opportunity of answering these precious proofs.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312494"><said direct="true">'I will,'</said><said direct="false"> answered Philip; who could venture on doing so himself, though for his sister's sake it was unsafe to trust Mr. Edmonstone, with whom what was not an absolute secret was not a secret at all. 'My uncle knows that a thirty pound cheque of his, in your name, was paid by you to a notorious gamester.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312495"><said direct="false">Guy did not shrink, as he simply answered—'It is true.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312496"><said direct="false">'Yet you have neither played, nor betted, nor done anything that could come under the definition of gambling?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312497"><said direct="false">'No.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312498"><said direct="false">'Then why this payment?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312499"><said direct="true">'I cannot explain that. I know appearances are against me,'</said><said direct="false"> replied Guy, steadily, and with less irritation than he had hitherto shown. 'I once thought my simple word would have sufficed; but since it seems that will not do, I will not again make what you call assertions.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312500"><said direct="false">'In fact, while you profess a desire to be open and sincere, a mystery appears at every turn. What would you have us do?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312501"><said direct="true">'As you think fit,'</said><said direct="false"> he answered, proudly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312502"><said direct="false">Philip had been used to feel men's wills and characters bend and give way beneath his superior force of mind. They might, like Charles, chafe and rage, but his calmness always gave him the ascendant almost without exertion, and few people had ever come into contact with him without a certain submission of will or opinion. With Guy alone it was not so; he had been sensible of it once or twice before; he had no mastery, and could no more bend that spirit than a bar of steel. This he could not bear, for it obliged him to be continually making efforts to preserve his own sense of superiority.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312503"><said direct="true">'Since this is your ultimatum,'</said><said direct="false"> he said—'since you deny your confidence, and refuse any reply to these charges, you have no right to complain of suspicion. I shall do my best, both as your true friend, and as acting with your guardian's authority, to discover all that may lead to the elucidation of the mystery. In the first place, I am desired to make every inquiry here as to your conduct and expenditure. I hope they will prove satisfactory.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312504"><said direct="true">'I am very much obliged to you,'</said><said direct="false"> answered Guy, his voice stern and dignified; and the smile that curled his lip was like Philip's own.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312505"><said direct="false">Philip was positively annoyed, and desirous to say something to put him down, but he had not committed himself by any vehemence, and Philip was too cool and wise to compromise his own dignity; so he rose to go, saying, 'Good night! I am sorry I cannot induce you to act in the only way that can right you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312506"><said direct="true">'Good night!'</said><said direct="false"> replied Guy, in the same dignified manner in which he had spoken ever since his passion had been surmounted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312507"><said direct="false">They parted, each feeling that matters were just where they were before. Philip went back to his inn, moralizing on the pride and perverseness which made it impossible to make any impression on a Redclyffe Morville, whom not even the fear of detection could lead to submission.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312508"><said direct="false">Next morning, while Philip was hastily breakfasting, the door opened, and Guy entered, pale and disturbed, as if he had been awake all night.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312509"><said direct="true">'Philip!'</said><said direct="false"> said he, in his frank natural voice, 'I don't think we parted last night as your good intentions deserved.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312510"><said direct="true">'O, ho!'</said><said direct="false"> thought Philip, 'the fear of an investigation has brought him to reason;' and he said, 'Well, I am very glad you see things in a truer light this morning;' then asked if he had breakfasted. He had; and his cousin added,</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312511"><said direct="false">'Have you anything to say on the matter we discussed last night?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312512"><said direct="false">'No. I can only repeat that I am not guilty, and wait for time to show my innocence. I only came to see you once more, that I might feel that we parted friends.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312513"><said direct="false">'I shall always hope to be a true friend.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312514"><said direct="true">'I did not come here for altercation,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy (an answer rather to the spirit than the words), 'so I will say no more. If you wish to see me again, you will find me in my rooms. Good bye.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312515"><said direct="false">Philip was puzzled. He wondered whether Guy had come wishing to propitiate him, but had found pride indomitable at the last moment; or whether he had been showing himself too severely just to admit entreaty. He would be able to judge better after he had made his inquiries, and he proceeded with them at once. He met with no such replies as he expected. Every one spoke of Sir Guy Morville in high terms, strict in his habits of application, and irreproachable in conduct. He was generally liked, and some regret was expressed that he lived in so secluded a manner, forming so few intimacies; but no one seemed to think it possible that anything wrong could be imputed to him. Philip could even perceive that there was some surprise that such inquiries should be made at all, especially by so young a man as himself. Mr. Wellwood, the person whom he most wished to see, was not at Oxford, but was at home preparing for his ordination.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312516"><said direct="false">Nor could Philip get nearer to the solution of the mystery when he went to the tradesmen, who were evidently as much surprised as the tutors, and said he always paid in ready money. Captain Morville felt like a lawyer whose case is breaking down, no discoveries made, nothing done; but he was not one whit convinced of his cousin's innocence, thinking the college authorities blind and careless, and the tradesmen combined to conceal their extortions, or else that the mischief had been done at St. Mildred's. He was particularly provoked when he remembered Guy's invitation to him to come to his rooms, knowing, as he must have done, what would be the result of the inquiry.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312517"><said direct="false">Philip was conscious that it would have been kind to have gone to say that, so far, he had found nothing amiss, but he did not like giving Guy this passing triumph. It made no difference in his real opinion; and why renew a useless discussion? He persuaded himself that he had left himself no time, and should miss the train, and hastened off to the station, where he had to wait a quarter of an hour, consoling himself with reflecting—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312518"><said direct="false">'After all, though I might have gone to him, it would have been useless. He is obstinate, and occasions of irritating his unfortunate temper are above all to be avoided.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312519"><said direct="false">One short year after, what would not Philip have given for that quarter of an hour.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312520"><said direct="false">By six o'clock he was at St. Mildred's, greeted with delight by his sister, and with cordiality by Dr. Henley. They were both proud of him, and every tender feeling his sister had, was for Philip, her pet and her pupil in his childhood, and her most valued companion and counsellor through her early womanhood.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312521"><said direct="false">She had a picked dinner-party to meet him, for she knew the doctor's conversation was not exactly the thing to entertain him through a whole evening, and the guests might well think they had never seen a handsomer or more clever brother and sister than Mrs. Henley and Captain Morville. The old county families, if they did wonder at her marriage, were always glad to meet her brother, and it was a great pleasure to him to see old friends.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312522"><said direct="false">Only once did his sister, in the course of the evening, make him feel the difference of their sentiments, and that was about Miss Wellwood. Philip defended her warmly; and when he heard that there was a plan getting up for excluding her from the hospital, he expressed strong disapprobation at the time; and after the guests were gone, spoke upon the subject with his sister and her husband. The doctor entered into no party questions, and had only been stirred up to the opposition by his wife; he owned that the Miss Wellwoods had done a great deal of good, and made the nurses do their duty better than he had ever known, and was quite ready to withdraw his opposition. Mrs. Henley argued about opinions, but Philip was a match for her in her own line; and the end of it was, that though she would not allow herself to be convinced, and shook her head at her brother's way of thinking, he knew he had prevailed, and that Miss Wellwood would be unmolested.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312523"><said direct="false">There was not another person in the world to whom Margaret would have yielded; and it served to restore him to the sense of universal dominion which had been a little shaken by his conversation with Guy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312524"><said direct="true">'Sir Guy was a great deal with the Wellwoods,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Henley.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312525"><said direct="false">'Was he, indeed?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312526"><said direct="false">'O, you need not think of that . It would be too absurd. The youngest must be twice his age.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312527"><said direct="true">'I was not thinking of any such thing,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, smiling as he thought of the very different course Guy's affections had taken.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312528"><said direct="false">'I did hear he was to marry Lady Eveleen de Courcy. Is there anything in that report?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312529"><said direct="false">'No, certainly not.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312530"><said direct="false">'I should pity the woman who married him, after the specimen I saw of his temper.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312531"><said direct="true">'Poor boy!'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312532"><said direct="false">'Lady Eveleen has been a great deal at Hollywell, has she not? I rather wondered my aunt should like to have her there, considering all things.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312533"><said direct="false">'What things, sister?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312534"><said direct="false">'Considering what a catch he would be for one of the Edmonstone girls.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312535"><said direct="false">'I thought you had just been pitying the woman who should marry him. Perhaps my aunt had Lady Eveleen there to act as a screen for her own daughters.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312536"><said direct="true">'That our good-natured aunt should have acted with such ultra-prudence!'</said><said direct="false"> said Margaret, laughing at his grave, ironical tone. 'Lady Eveleen is very pretty, is she not? A mere beauty, I believe?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312537"><said direct="false">'Just so; she is much admired; but Guy is certainly not inclined to fall in love with her.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312538"><said direct="true">'I should have thought him the very man to fall in love young, like his father. Do you think there is any chance for either of the Edmonstones? Laura'</said><said direct="false">s beauty he spoke of, but it was not in a very lover-like way. Do you admire Laura so much?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312539"><said direct="false">'She is very pretty.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312540"><said direct="false">'And little Amy?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312541"><said direct="false">'She is a mere child, and will hardly ever be anything more; but she is a very good little amiable thing.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312542"><said direct="true">'I wish poor Charles'</said><said direct="false">s temper was improved.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312543"><said direct="true">'So do I; but it is very far from improvement at present, in consequence of his zeal for Guy. Guy has been very attentive and good-natured to him, and has quite won his heart; so that I should positively honour him for his championship if it was not in great degree out of opposition to his father and myself. To-morrow, Margaret, you must give me some guide to the most probable quarters for learning anything respecting this poor boy'</said><said direct="false">s follies.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312544"><said direct="false">Mrs. Henley did her best in that way, and Philip followed up his inquiries with great ardour, but still unsuccessfully. Jack White, the hero of the draft, was not at St. Mildred's, nor likely to be heard of again till the next races; and whether Sir Guy had been on the race-ground at all was a doubtful point. Next, Philip walked to Stylehurst, to call on Colonel Harewood, and see if he could learn anything in conversation with him; but the Colonel did not seem to know anything, and his sons were not at home. Young Morville was, he thought, a spirited lad, very good-natured; he had been out shooting once or twice with Tom, and had a very fine spaniel. If he had been at the races, the Colonel did not know it; he had had some thoughts of asking him to join their party, but had been prevented.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312545"><said direct="false">This was no reason, thought Philip, why Guy might not have been with Tom Harewood without the Colonel's knowledge. Tom was just the man to lead him amongst those who were given to betting; he might have been drawn in, and, perhaps, he had given some pledge of payment when he was of age, or, possibly, obtained an immediate supply of money from the old steward at Redclyffe, who was devotedly attached to him. If so, Philip trusted to be able to detect it from the accounts; on the other supposition, there was no hope of discovery.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312546"><said direct="false">The conversation with Colonel Harewood kept him so late that he had no time for going, as usual, to his old haunts, at Stylehurst; nor did he feel inclined just then to revive the saddening reflections they excited. He spent the evening in talking over books with his sister, and the next day proceeded on his journey to Thorndale Park.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312547"><said direct="false">This was one of the places where he was always the most welcome, ever since he had been a school-boy, received in a way especially flattering, considering that the friendship was entirely owing to the uncompromising good sense and real kindness with which he had kept in order the follies of his former fag.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312548"><said direct="false">Charles might laugh, and call them the young man and young man's companion, and Guy more classically term them the pious Æneas and his fidus Achates, but it was a friendship that did honour to both; and the value that the Thorndales set upon Captain Morville was not misplaced, and scarcely over-rated. Not particularly clever themselves, they the more highly appreciated his endowments, and were proud that 'James' had been able to make such a friend; for they knew, as well as the rest of the world, that Captain Morville was far from seeking the acquaintance for the sake of their situation in life, but that it was from real liking and esteem. How far this esteem was gained by the deference the whole family paid to his opinion, was another question; at any rate, the courting was from them.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312549"><said direct="false">The Miss Thorndales deemed Captain Morville the supreme authority in drawing, literature, and ecclesiastical architecture; and whenever a person came in their way who was thought handsome, always pronounced that he was not by any means equal to James's friend. Lady Thorndale delighted to talk over James with him, and thank him for his kindness; and Lord Thorndale, rather a pompous man himself, liked his somewhat stately manners, and talked politics with him, sincerely wishing he was his neighbour at Redclyffe, and calculating how much good he would do there. Philip listened with interest to accounts of how the Thorndale and Morville influence had always divided the borough of Moorworth, and, if united, might dispose of it at will, and returned evasive answers to questions what the young heir of Redclyffe might be likely to do.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312550"><said direct="false">James Thorndale drove his friend to Redclyffe, as Philip had authority from Mr. Edmonstone to transact any business that might be required with Markham, the steward; and, as has been said before, he expected to discover in the accounts something that might explain why Guy had ceased to press for the thousand pounds. However, he could find nothing amiss in them, though—bearing in mind that it is less easy to detect the loss of a score of sheep than of one—he subjected them to a scrutiny which seemed by no means agreeable to the gruff old grumbling steward. He also walked about the park, saw to the marking of certain trees that were injuring each other; and finding that there was a misunderstanding between Markham and the new rector, Mr. Ashford, about certain parish matters, where the clergyman was certainly right, he bore down Markham's opposition with Mr. Edmonstone's weight, and felt he was doing good service.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312551"><said direct="false">He paused at the gate, and looked back at the wide domain and fine old house. He pitied them, and the simple-hearted, honest tenantry, for being the heritage of such a family, and the possession of one so likely to misuse them, instead of training them into the means of conferring benefits on them, on his country. What would not Philip himself do if those lands were his, —just what was needed to give his talents free scope? and what would it be to see his beautiful Laura their mistress?</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312552"><said direct="false">Longfellow.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312553"><said direct="false">After his week at Thorndale Park, Captain Morville returned to make his farewell visit at Hollywell, before joining his regiment at Cork, whence it was to sail for the Mediterranean. He reckoned much on this visit, for not even Laura herself could fathom the depth of his affection for her, strengthening in the recesses where he so sternly concealed it, and viewing her ever as more faultless since she had been his own. While she was his noble, strong-minded, generous, fond Laura, he could bear with his disappointment in his sister, with the loss of his home, and with the trials that had made him a grave, severe man. She had proved the strength of her mind by the self-command he had taught her, and for which he was especially grateful to her, as it made him safer and more unconstrained, able to venture on more demonstration than in those early days when every look had made her blush and tremble.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312554"><said direct="false">Mr. Edmonstone brought the carriage to fetch him from the station, and quickly began,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312555"><said direct="false">'I suppose, as you have not written, you have found nothing out?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312556"><said direct="false">'Nothing.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312557"><said direct="false">'And you could do nothing with him. Eh?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312558"><said direct="false">'No; I could not get a word of explanation nor break through the fence of pride and reserve. I must do him the justice to say that he bears the best of characters at Oxford; and if there were any debts I could not get at them from the tradesmen.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312559"><said direct="true">'Well, well, say no more about it; he is an ungrateful young dog, and I am sick of it. I only wish I could wash my hands of him altogether. It was mere folly to expect any of that set could ever come to good. There'</said><said direct="false">s everything going wrong all at once now; poor little Amy breaking her heart after him, and, worse than all, there's poor Charlie laid up again,' said Mr. Edmonstone, one of the most affectionate people in the world; but his maundering mood making him speak of Charles's illness as if he only regarded it as an additional provocation for himself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312560"><said direct="true">'Charles ill!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312561"><said direct="false">'Yes; another of those formations in the joint. I hoped and trusted that was all over now; but he is as bad as ever,—has not been able to move for a week, and goodness knows when he will again.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312562"><said direct="false">'Indeed! I am very sorry. Is there as much pain as before?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312563"><said direct="false">'Oh, yes. He has not slept a wink these four nights. Mayerne talks of opium; but he says he wont have it till he has seen you, he is so anxious about this unlucky business. If anything could persuade me to have Guy back again, it would be that this eternal fretting after him is so bad for poor Charlie.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312564"><said direct="true">'It is on Amy'</said><said direct="false">s account that it is impossible to have him here,' said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312565"><said direct="false">'Ay! He shall never set eyes on Amy again unless all this is cleared up, which it never will be, as I desire mamma to tell her. By-the-bye, Philip, Amy said something of your having a slip with Charles on the stairs.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312566"><said direct="false">There was very nearly an accident; but I believed he was not hurt. I hope it has nothing to do with this illness?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312567"><said direct="true">'He says it was all his own fault,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mr. Edmonstone, 'and that he should have been actually down but for you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312568"><said direct="false">'But is it really thought it can have caused this attack?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312569"><said direct="true">'I can hardly suppose so; but Thompson fancies there may have been some jar. However, don'</said><said direct="false">t distress yourself, I dare say it would have come on all the same.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312570"><said direct="false">Philip did not like to be forgiven by Mr. Edmonstone, and there was something very annoying in having this mischance connected with his name, though without his fault; nor did he wish Charles to have the kind of advantage over him that might be derived from seeming to pass over his share in the misfortune.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312571"><said direct="false">When they arrived at Hollywell, it was twilight, but no one was in the drawing-room, generally so cheerful at that time of day; the fire had lately been smothered with coals, and looked gloomy and desolate. Mr. Edmonstone left Philip there, and ran up to see how Charles was, and soon after Laura came in, sprang to his side, and held his hand in both hers.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312572"><said direct="true">'You bring no good news?'</said><said direct="false"> said she, sadly, as she read the answer in his face. 'Oh! how I wish you had. It would be such a comfort now. You have heard about poor Charlie?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312573"><said direct="false">'Yes; and very sorry I am. But, Laura, is it really thought that accident could have occasioned it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312574"><said direct="true">'Dr. Mayerne does not think so, only Mr. Thompson talked of remote causes, when Amy mentioned it. I don'</said><said direct="false">t believe it did any harm, and Charlie himself says you saved him from falling down stairs.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312575"><said direct="false">Philip had begun to give Laura his version of the accident, as he had already done to her father, when Mrs. Edmonstone came down, looking harassed and anxious. She told her nephew that Charles was very desirous to see him, and sent him up at once.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312576"><said direct="false">There was a fire in the dressing-room, and the door was open into the little room, which was only lighted by a lamp on a small table, where Amy was sitting at work. After shaking hands, she went away, leaving him alone with Charles, who lay in his narrow bed against the wall, fixed in one position, his forehead contracted with pain, his eyelids red and heavy from sleeplessness, his eyes very quick and eager, and his hands and arms thrown restlessly outside the coverings.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312577"><said direct="true">'I am very sorry to find you here,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, coming up to him, and taking, rather than receiving, his hot, limp hand. 'Is the pain very bad?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312578"><said direct="true">'That is a matter of course,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, in a sharp, quick manner, his voice full of suffering. 'I want to hear what you have been doing at Oxford and St. Mildred's.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312579"><said direct="false">'I am sorry I do not bring the tidings you wish.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312580"><said direct="true">'I did not expect you would. I know you too well; but I want to hear what you have been doing—what he said,'</said><said direct="false"> answered Charles, in short, impatient sentences.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312581"><said direct="false">'It can be of no use, Charlie. You are not in a state to enter on agitating subjects.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312582"><said direct="true">'I tell you I will hear all,'</said><said direct="false"> returned Charles, with increased asperity. 'I know you will say nothing to his advantage that you can help, but still I know you will speak what you think the truth, and I want to judge for myself.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312583"><said direct="false">'You speak as if I was not acting for his good.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312584"><said direct="true">'Palaver!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Charles, fully sensible of the advantage his illness gave him. 'I want the facts. Begin at the beginning. Sit down—there's a chair by you. Now tell me, where did you find him?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312585"><said direct="false">Philip could not set Charles down in his present state, and was obliged to submit to a cross-examination, in which he showed no abatement of his natural acuteness, and, unsparing as he always was, laid himself under no restraint at all. Philip was compelled to give a full history of his researches; and if he had afforded no triumph to Guy, Charles revenged him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312586"><said direct="false">'Pray, what did Guy say when he heard the result of this fine voyage of discovery?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312587"><said direct="false">'I did not see him again.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312588"><said direct="false">'Not see him! not tell him he was so far justified!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312589"><said direct="false">'I had no time—at least I thought not. It would have been useless, for while these mysteries continue, my opinion is unchanged, and there was no benefit in renewing vain disputes.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312590"><said direct="true">'Say no more!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Charles. 'You have said all I expected, and more too. I gave you credit for domineering and prejudice, now I see it is malignity.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312591"><said direct="false">As he spoke, Laura entered from the dressing-room, and stood aghast at the words, then looked imploringly at her cousin. Dr. Mayerne was following her, and Charles called out,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312592"><said direct="false">'Now, doctor, give me as much opium as you please. I only want to be stupified till the world has turned round, and then you may wake me.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312593"><said direct="false">Philip shook hands with Dr. Mayerne, and, without betraying a shade of annoyance, wished Charles good night, but Charles had drawn the coverings over his head, and would not hear him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312594"><said direct="true">'Poor fellow!'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip to Laura, when they were out of the room. 'He is a very generous partizan, and excitement and suffering make him carry his zeal to excess.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312595"><said direct="false">'I knew you could not be angry with him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312596"><said direct="false">'I could not be angry at this time at far more provocation given by any one belonging to you, Laura.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312597"><said direct="false">Laura's heart had that sensation which the French call se serrer , as she heard him allude to the long separation to which there seemed no limit; but they could say no more.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312598"><said direct="true">'Amy,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, when she returned to him after dinner, 'I am more than ever convinced that things will right themselves. I never saw prejudice more at fault.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312599"><said direct="false">'Did he tell you all about it?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312600"><said direct="false">'I worked out of him all I could, and it is my belief Guy had the best of it. I only wonder he did not horsewhip Philip round the quadrangle. I wish he had.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312601"><said direct="false">'Oh, no, no! But he controlled himself?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312602"><said direct="true">'If he had not we should have heard of it fast enough;'</said><said direct="false"> and Charles told what he had been able to gather, while she sat by, divided between joy and pain.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312603"><said direct="false">Philip saw very little more of Charles. He used to come to ask him how he was once a-day, but never received any encouragement to lengthen his visit. These gatherings in the diseased joint were always excessively painful, and were very long in coming to the worst, as well as afterwards in healing, and through the week of Philip's stay at Hollywell Charles was either in a state of great suffering, or else heavy and confused with opiates. His mother's whole time and thoughts were absorbed in him; she attended to him day and night, and could hardly spare a moment for anything else. Indeed, with all her affection and anxiety for the young lovers, Charles was so entirely her engrossing object, that her first feeling of disappointment at the failure of Philip's journey of investigation was because it would grieve Charlie. She could not think about Guy just then, and for Amy, there was nothing for it but patience; and, good little creature, it was very nice to see her put her own troubles aside, and be so cheerful a nurse to her brother. She was almost always in his room, for he liked to have her there, and she could not conquer a certain shrinking from Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312604"><said direct="false">Laura had once pleaded hard and earnestly for Guy with Philip, but all in vain, she only was taught to think the case more hopeless than before. Laura was a very kind nurse and sister, but she could better be spared than her mother and Amy, so that it generally fell to her lot to be downstairs, making the drawing-room habitable. Dr. Mayerne, whenever Charles was ill, used to be more at Hollywell than at his own house, and there were few days that he did not dine there. When Amy was out of the way, Philip used to entertain them with long accounts of Redclyffe, how fine a place it was, how far the estate reached on the Moorworth road, of its capacities for improvement, wastes of moorland to be enclosed or planted, magnificent timber needing nothing but thinning. He spoke of the number of tenantry, and the manorial rights, and the influence in both town and county, which, in years gone by, had been proved to the utmost in many a fierce struggle with the house of Thorndale. Sir Guy Morville might be one of the first men in England if he were not wanting to himself. Mr. Edmonstone enjoyed such talk, for it made him revel in the sense of his own magnanimity in refusing his daughter to the owner of all this, and Laura sometimes thought how Philip would have graced such a position, yet how much greater it was to rest entirely on his own merits.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312605"><said direct="true">'Ah, my fine fellow!'</said><said direct="false"> muttered Dr. Mayerne to himself one day, when Philip and his uncle had left the room, just after a discourse of this kind, 'I see you have not forgotten you are the next heir.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312606"><said direct="false">Laura coloured with indignation, exclaimed 'Oh!' then checked herself, as if such an aspersion was not worthy of her taking the trouble to refute it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312607"><said direct="false">'Ah! Miss Edmonstone, I did not know you were there!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312608"><said direct="true">'Yes, you were talking to yourself, just as if you were at home,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte, who was specially pert to the old doctor, because she knew herself to be a great pet. 'You were telling some home truths to make Laura angry.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312609"><said direct="true">'Well, he would make a very good use of it if he had it,'</said><said direct="false"> said the doctor.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312610"><said direct="true">'Now you'</said><said direct="false">ll make me angry,' said Charlotte; 'and you have not mended matters with Laura. She thinks nothing short of four-syllabled words good enough for Philip.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312611"><said direct="true">'Hush! nonsense, Charlotte!'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, much annoyed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312612"><said direct="true">'There, Charlotte, she is avenging herself on you because she can'</said><said direct="false">t scold me,' said the doctor, pretending to whisper.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312613"><said direct="true">'Charlotte is only growing more wild than ever for want of mamma,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura, trying to laugh it off; but there was so much annoyance evident about her, that Dr. Mayerne said,—'Seriously, I must apologize for my unlucky soliloquy; not that I thought I was saying much harm, for I did not by any means say or think the Captain wished Sir Guy any ill, and few men who stood next in succession to such a property would be likely to forget it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312614"><said direct="true">'Yes, but Philip is not like other men,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte, who, at fourteen, had caught much of her brother's power of repartee, and could be quite as provoking, when unrestrained by any one whom she cared to obey.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312615"><said direct="false">Laura felt it was more for her dignity not to notice this, and replied, with an effort for a laugh,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312616"><said direct="false">'It must be your guilty conscience that sets you apologizing, for you said no harm, as you observe.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312617"><said direct="true">'Yes,'</said><said direct="false"> said Dr. Mayerne, good-humouredly. 'He does very well without it, and no doubt he would be one of the first men in the country if he had it; but it is in very good hands now, on the whole. I don't think, even if the lad has been tempted into a little folly just now, that he can ever go very far wrong.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312618"><said direct="true">'No, indeed,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte; 'but Charlie and I don't believe he has done anything wrong.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312619"><said direct="false">She spoke in a little surly decided tone, as if her opinion put an end to the matter, and Philip's return closed the discussion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185312620"><said direct="false">Divided as the party were between upstairs and downstairs, and in the absence of Charles's shrewd observation, Philip and Laura had more opportunity of intercourse than usual, and now that his departure would put an end to suspicion, they ventured on more openly seeking each other. It never could be the perfect freedom that they had enjoyed before the avowal of their sentiments, but they had many brief conversations, giving Laura feverish, but exquisite, delight at each renewal of his rare expressions of tenderness.</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG185311554"><said direct="true">'I think she misses what she has been used to from him, and thinks him estranged, but I trust it goes no further. I see she is out of spirits; I wish I could help her, dear girl, but the worst of all would be to let her guess the real name and meaning of all this, so I can'</said><said direct="false">t venture to say a word.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311555"><said direct="true">'She is very innocent of novels,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, 'and that is well. It would be an unlucky business to have our poor beauty either sitting 'like Patience on a monument,' 'or cockit up on a baggage wagon.' But that will never be. Philip is not the man to have a wife in barracks. He would have her like his books, in morocco, or not at all.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311556"><said direct="false">'He would never involve her in discomforts. He may be entirely trusted, and as long as he goes on as he has begun, there is no harm done; Laura will cheer up, will only consider him as her cousin and friend, and never know he has felt more for her.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311557"><said direct="false">'Her going to Ireland is very fortunate.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311558"><said direct="false">'It has made me still more glad that the plan should take place at once.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311559"><said direct="true">'And you say '</said><said direct="false">nothing to nobody?''</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311560"><said direct="true">'Of course not. We must not let him guess we have observed anything; there is no need to make your father uncomfortable, and such things need not dawn on Amy'</said><said direct="false">s imagination.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311561"><said direct="false">It may be wondered at that Mrs. Edmonstone should confide such a subject to her son, but she knew that in a case really affecting his sister, and thus introduced, his silence was secure. In fact, confidence was the only way to prevent the shrewd, unscrupulous raillery which would have caused great distress, and perhaps led to the very disclosure to be deprecated. Of late, too, there had been such a decrease of petulance in Charles, as justified her in trusting him; and, lastly, it must be observed that she was one of those openhearted people who cannot make a discovery nor endure an anxiety without imparting it. Her tact, indeed, led her to make a prudent choice of confidants, and, in this case her son was by far the best, though she had spoken without premeditation. Her nature would never have allowed her to act as her daughter was doing; she would have been without the strength to conceal her feelings, especially when deprived of the safety-valve of free intercourse with their object.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311562"><said direct="false">The visit took place as arranged, and very uncomfortable it was to all who looked deeper than the surface. In the first place, Philip found there the last person he wished his friend to meet—Lady Eveleen, who had been persuaded to stay for the dinner party; but Mr. Thorndale was, as Charles would have said, on his good behaviour, and, ashamed of the fascination her manners exercised over him, was resolved to resist it, answered her gay remarks with brief sentences and stiff smiles, and consorted chiefly with the gentlemen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311563"><said direct="false">Laura was grave and silent, trying to appear unconscious, and only succeeding in being visibly constrained. Philip was anxious and stern in his attempts to appear unconcerned, and even Guy was not quite as bright and free as usual, being puzzled as to how far he was forgiven about the ball.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311564"><said direct="false">Amabel could not think what had come to every one, and tried in vain to make them sociable. In the evening they had recourse to a game, said to be for Charlotte's amusement, but in reality to obviate some of the stiffness and constraint; yet even this led to awkward situations. Each person was to set down his or her favourite character in history and fiction, flower, virtue, and time at which to have lived, and these were all to be appropriated to the writers. The first read was—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311565"><said direct="false">'Lily of the valley—truth—Joan of Arc—Padre Cristoforo—the present time.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311566"><said direct="true">'Amy!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Guy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311567"><said direct="true">'I see you are right,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles; 'but tell me your grounds?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311568"><said direct="true">'Padre Cristoforo,'</said><said direct="false"> was the answer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311569"><said direct="true">'Fancy little Amy choosing Joan of Arc,'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen, 'she who is afraid of a tolerable sized grasshopper.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311570"><said direct="true">'I should like to have been Joan'</said><said direct="false">s sister, and heard her tell about her visions,' said Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311571"><said direct="true">'You would have taught her to believe them,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311572"><said direct="true">'Taught her!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Guy. 'Surely you take the high view of her.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311573"><said direct="true">'I think,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, 'that she is a much injured person, as much by her friends as her enemies; but I don't pretend to enter either enthusiastically or philosophically into her character.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311574"><said direct="false">What was it that made Guy's brow contract, as he began to strip the feather of a pen, till, recollecting himself, he threw it from him with a dash, betraying some irritation, and folded his hands.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311575"><said direct="true">'Lavender,'</said><said direct="false"> read Charlotte.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311576"><said direct="true">'What should make any one choose that?'</said><said direct="false"> cried Eveleen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311577"><said direct="true">'I know!'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking up. 'I shall never forget the tufts of lavender round the kitchen garden at Stylehurst.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311578"><said direct="false">Philip smiled. Charlotte proceeded, and Charles saw Laura's colour deepening as she bent over her work.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311579"><said direct="true">'Lavender—steadfastness—Strafford—Cordelia, in '</said><said direct="false">King Lear' —the late war.' How funny!' cried Charlotte. 'For hear the next; 'Honeysuckle—steadfastness —Lord Strafford—Cordelia—the present time.' Why, Laura, you must have copied it from Philip's.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311580"><said direct="false">Laura neither looked nor spoke. Philip could hardly command his countenance as Eveleen laughed, and told him he was much flattered by those becoming blushes. But here Charles broke in,—'Come, make haste, Charlotte, don't be all night about it;' and as Charlotte paused, as if to make some dangerous remark, he caught the paper, and read the next himself. Nothing so startled Philip as this desire to cover their confusion. Laura was only sensible of the relief of having attention drawn from her by the laugh that followed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311581"><said direct="true">'A shamrock—Captain Rock—the tailor that was '</said><said direct="false">blue moulded for want of a bating'—Pat Riotism—the time of Malachy with the collar of gold.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311582"><said direct="true">'Eva!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Charlotte.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311583"><said direct="true">'Nonsense,'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen; 'I am glad I know your tastes, Charles. They do you honour.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311584"><said direct="true">'More than yours do, if these are yours,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, reading them contemptuously; 'Rose—generosity —Charles Edward—Catherine Seyton—the civil wars.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311585"><said direct="true">'You had better not have disowned Charlie'</said><said direct="false">s, Lady Eveleen?' said Guy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311586"><said direct="true">'Nay, do you think I would put up with such a set as these?'</said><said direct="false"> retorted Charles; 'I am not fallen so low as the essence of young-ladyism.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311587"><said direct="true">'What can you find to say against them?'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311588"><said direct="true">'Nothing,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles. 'No one ever can find anything to say for or against young ladies' tastes.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311589"><said direct="true">'You seem to be rather in the case of the tailor yourself,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, 'ready to do battle, if you could but get any opposition.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311590"><said direct="true">'Only tell me,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, 'how you could wish to live in the civil wars?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311591"><said direct="false">'O, because they would be so entertaining.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311592"><said direct="true">'There'</said><said direct="false">s Paddy, genuine Paddy, at last!' exclaimed Charles. 'Depend upon it, the conventional young lady wont do, Eva.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311593"><said direct="false">After much more discussion, and one or two more papers, came Guy's—the last. 'Heather—Truth— King Charles—Sir Galahad—the present time.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311594"><said direct="true">'Sir how much?'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Charles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311595"><said direct="true">'Don'</said><said direct="false">t you know him?' said Guy. 'Sir Galahad— the Knight of the Siege Perilous—who won the Saint Greal.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311596"><said direct="true">'What language is that?'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311597"><said direct="true">'What! Don'</said><said direct="false">t you know the Morte d'Arthur? I thought every one did! Don't you, Philip?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311598"><said direct="false">'I once looked into it. It is very curious, in classical English; but it is a book no one could read through.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311599"><said direct="true">'Oh!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Guy, indignantly, then; 'but you only looked into it. If you had lived with its two fat volumes, you could not help delighting in it. It was my boating-book for at least three summers.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311600"><said direct="true">'That accounts for it,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip; 'a book so studied in boyhood acquires a charm apart from its actual merits.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311601"><said direct="false">'But it has actual merits. The depth, the mystery, the allegory—the beautiful characters of some of the knights.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311602"><said direct="true">'You look through the medium of your imagination,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip; 'but you must pardon others for seeing a great sameness of character and adventure, and for disapproving of the strange mixture of religion and romance.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311603"><said direct="true">'You'</said><said direct="false">ve never read it,' said Guy, striving to speak patiently.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311604"><said direct="false">'A cursory view is sufficient to show whether a book will repay the time spent in reading it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311605"><said direct="true">'A cursory view enable one to judge better than making it your study? Eh, Philip?'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311606"><said direct="false">'It is no paradox. The actual merits are better seen by an unprejudiced stranger than by an old friend, who lends them graces of his own devising.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311607"><said direct="false">Charles laughed; Guy pushed back his chair, and went to look out at the window. Perhaps Philip enjoyed thus chafing his temper; for after all he had said to Laura, it was satisfactory to see his opinion justified, so that he might not feel himself unfair. It relieved his uneasiness lest his understanding with Laura should be observed. It had been in great peril that evening, for as the girls went up to bed, Eveleen gaily said, 'Why, Laura, have you quarrelled with Captain Morville?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311608"><said direct="true">'How can you say such things, Eva? Good night.'</said><said direct="false"> And Laura escaped into her own room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311609"><said direct="true">'What'</said><said direct="false">s the meaning of it, Amy?' pursued Eveleen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311610"><said direct="true">'Only a stranger makes us more formal,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311611"><said direct="true">'What an innocent you are! It is of no use to talk to you!'</said><said direct="false"> said Eveleen, running away.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311612"><said direct="true">'No; but Eva,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, pursuing her; 'don't go off with a wrong fancy. Charles has teased Laura so much about Philip, that of course it makes her shy of him before strangers; and it would never have done to laugh about their choosing the same things, when Mr. Thorndale was there.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311613"><said direct="false">'I must be satisfied, I suppose. I know that is what you think, for you could not say any other.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311614"><said direct="true">'But what do you think?'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, puzzled.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311615"><said direct="true">'I won'</said><said direct="false">t tell you, little innocence—it would only shock you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311616"><said direct="true">'Nothing you really thought about Laura could shock me,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy; 'I don't mean what you might say in play.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311617"><said direct="false">'Well, then, shall you think me in play or earnest when I say that I think Laura likes Philip very much?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311618"><said direct="true">'In play,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy; 'for you know that if we had not got our own Charlie to show us what a brother is, we should think of Philip as just the same as a brother.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311619"><said direct="true">'A brother! You are pretending to be more simple than you really are, Amy! Don'</said><said direct="false">t you know what I mean?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311620"><said direct="true">'O,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, her cheeks lighting up, 'that must be only play, for he has never asked her.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311621"><said direct="false">'Ah! but suppose she was in the state just ready to be asked.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311622"><said direct="false">'No, that could never be, for he could never ask her.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311623"><said direct="false">'Why not, little Amy?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311624"><said direct="true">'Because we are cousins, and everything!'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, confused. 'Don't talk any more about it, Eva; for though I know it is all play, I don't like it, and mamma would not wish me to talk of such things. And don't you laugh about it, dear Eva, pray; for it only makes every one uncomfortable. Pray!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311625"><said direct="false">Amy had a very persuasive way of saying 'pray,' and Eveleen thought she must yield to it. Besides, she respected Laura and Captain Morville too much to resolve to laugh at them, whatever she might do when her fear of the Captain made her saucy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311626"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone thought it best on all accounts to sit in the drawing-room the next morning; but she need not have taken so much pains to chaperon her young ladies, for the gentlemen did not come near them.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311627"><said direct="false">Laura was more at ease in manner, though very far from happy, for she was restlessly eager for a talk with Philip; while he was resolved not to seek a private interview, sure that it would excite suspicion, and willing to lose the consciousness of his underhand proceedings.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311628"><said direct="false">This was the day of the dinner-party, and Laura's heart leapt as she calculated that it must fall to Philip's lot to hand her in to dinner. She was not mistaken, he did give her his arm; and they found themselves most favourably placed, for Philip's other neighbour was Mrs. Brownlow, talking at a great rate to Mr. de Courcy, and on Laura's side was the rather deaf Mr. Hayley, who had quite enough to do to talk to Miss Brownlow. Charles was not at table, and not one suspicious eye could rest on them; yet it was not till the second course was in progress that he said anything which the whole world might not have heard. Something had passed about Canterbury, and its distance from Hollywell.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311629"><said direct="true">'I can be here often,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311630"><said direct="false">'I am glad.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311631"><said direct="false">'If you can only be guarded,—and I think you are becoming so.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311632"><said direct="true">'Is this a time to speak of—? Oh, don'</said><said direct="false">t!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311633"><said direct="false">'It is the only time. No one is attending, and I have something to say to you.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311634"><said direct="false">Overpowering her dire confusion, in obedience to him, she looked at the epergne, and listened.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311635"><said direct="true">'You have acted prudently. You have checked—'</said><said direct="false"> and he indicated Guy, 'without producing more than moderate annoyance. You have only to guard your self-possession.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311636"><said direct="true">'It is very foolish,'</said><said direct="false"> she murmured.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311637"><said direct="false">'Ordinary women say so, and rest contented with the folly. You can do better things.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311638"><said direct="false">There was a thrill of joy at finding him conversing with her as 'his own,' it overcame her embarrassment and alarm, and wishes he would not choose such a time for speaking.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311639"><said direct="true">'How shall I?'</said><said direct="false"> said she.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311640"><said direct="false">'Employ yourself. Employ and strengthen your mind!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311641"><said direct="false">'How shall I, and without you?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311642"><said direct="false">'Find something to prevent you from dwelling on the future. That drawing is dreamy work, employing the fingers, and leaving the mind free.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311643"><said direct="false">'I have been trying to read, but I cannot fix my mind.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311644"><said direct="false">'Suppose you take what will demand attention. Mathematics, algebra. I will send you my first book of algebra, and it will help you to work down many useless dreams and anxieties.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311645"><said direct="false">'Thank you; pray do, I shall be very glad of it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311646"><said direct="false">'You will find it give a power and stability to your mind, and no longer have to complain of frivolous occupation.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311647"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t feel frivolous now,' said Laura, sadly; 'I don't know why it is that everything is so altered, I am really happier, but my light heart is gone.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311648"><said direct="false">'You have but now learnt the full powers of your soul, Laura; you have left the world of childhood, with the gay feelings which have no depth.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311649"><said direct="true">'I have what is better,'</said><said direct="false"> she whispered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311650"><said direct="false">'You have, indeed. But those feelings must be regulated; and strengthening the intellect strengthens the governing power.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311651"><said direct="false">Philip, with all his sense, was mystifying himself, because he was departing from right, the only true 'good sense.' His right judgment in all things was becoming obscured, so he talked metaphysical jargon instead of plain practical truth, and thought he was teaching Laura to strengthen her powers of mind, instead of giving way to dreams, when he was only leading her to stifle meditation, and thus securing her complete submission to himself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311652"><said direct="false">She was happier after this conversation, and better able to pay attention to the guests, nor did she feel guilty when obliged to play and sing in the evening— for she knew he must own that she could do no otherwise.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311653"><said direct="false">Lady Eveleen gave, however, its brilliancy to the party. She had something wonderfully winning and fascinating about her, and Philip owned to himself that it took no small resolution on the part of Mr. Thorndale to keep so steadily aloof from the party in the bay window where she was reigning like a queen, and inspiring gaiety like a fairy. She made Guy sing with her; it was the first time he had ever sung, except among themselves, as Mrs. Edmonstone had never known whether he would like to be asked; but Eveleen refused to sing some of the Irish melodies unless he would join her, and without making any difficulty he did so. Mrs. Brownlow professed to be electrified, and Eveleen, declaring that she knew she sung like a peacock, told Mrs. Brownlow that the thing to hear was Sir Guy singing glees with Laura and Amy. Of course, they were obliged to sing. Mrs. Brownlow was delighted; and as she had considerable knowledge of music, they all grew eager; and Philip thought it very foolish of Guy to allow so much of his talent and enthusiasm to display themselves.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311654"><said direct="false">When all the people were gone, and the home party had wished each other good night, Philip lingered in the drawing-room to finish a letter. Guy, after helping Charles up stairs, came down a few moments after, to fetch something which he had forgotten. Philip looked up,—'You contributed greatly to the entertainment this evening,' he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311655"><said direct="false">Guy coloured, not quite sure that this was not said sarcastically, and provoked with himself for being vexed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311656"><said direct="true">'You think one devoid of the sixth sense has no right to speak,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311657"><said direct="true">'I can'</said><said direct="false">t expect all to think it, as I do, one of the best things in this world or out of it,' said Guy, speaking quickly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311658"><said direct="true">'I know it is so felt by those who understand its secrets,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip. 'I would not depreciate it; so you may hear me patiently, Guy. I only meant to warn you, that it is often the means of bringing persons into undesirable intimacies, from which they cannot disentangle themselves as easily as they enter them.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311659"><said direct="false">A flush crossed Guy's cheek, but it passed, and he simply said,—'I suppose it may. Good night.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311660"><said direct="false">Philip looked after him, and pondered on what it was that had annoyed him—manner, words, or advice. He ascribed it to Guy's unwillingness to be advised, since he had observed that his counsel was apt to irritate him, though his good sense often led him to follow it. In the present case, Philip thought Mrs. Brownlow and her society by no means desirable for a youth like Guy; and he was quite right.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311661"><said direct="false">Philip and his friend went the next morning; and in the afternoon Laura received the book of algebra,—a very original first gift from a lover. It came openly, with a full understanding that she was to use it by his recommendation; her mother and brother both thought they understood the motive, which one thought very wise, and the other very characteristic.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311662"><said direct="false">Lord Kilcoran and Lady Eveleen also departed. Eveleen very sorry to go, though a little comforted by the prospect of seeing Laura so soon in Ireland, where she would set her going in all kinds of 'rationalities— reading, and school teaching, and everything else.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311663"><said direct="true">'Ay,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charles, when all were out of hearing but his mother; 'and I shrewdly suspect the comfort would be still greater if it was Sir Guy Morville who was coming.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311664"><said direct="true">'It would be no bad thing,'</said><said direct="false"> said his mother; 'Eveleen is a nice creature, with great capabilities.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311665"><said direct="false">'Capabilities! but will they ever come to anything?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311666"><said direct="true">'In a few years,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone; 'and he is a mere boy at present, so there is plenty of time for both to develope themselves.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311667"><said direct="false">'Most true, madame mère; but it remains to be proved whether the liking for Sir Guy, which has taken hold of my Lady Eveleen, is strong enough to withstand all the coquetting with young Irishmen, and all the idling at Kilcoran.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311668"><said direct="false">'I hope she has something better to be relied on than the liking for Sir Guy.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311669"><said direct="false">'You may well do so, for I think he has no notion of throwing off his allegiance to you,—his first and only love. He liked very well to make fun with Eva; but he regarded her rather as a siren who drew him off from his Latin and Greek.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311670"><said direct="false">'Yes; I am ashamed of myself for such a fit of match-making! Forget it, Charlie, as fast as you can.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311671"><said direct="false">Burns.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311672"><said direct="false">In another week Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter were to depart on their Irish journey. Laura, besides the natural pain in leaving home, was sorry to be no longer near Philip, especially as it was not likely that he would be still at Broadstone on their return; yet she was so restless and dissatisfied, that any change was welcome, and the fear of betraying herself almost took away the pleasure of his presence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311673"><said direct="false">He met them at the railway-station at Broadstone, where Mr. Edmonstone, finding himself much too early, recollected something he had forgotten in the town, and left his daughter to walk up and down the platform under Philip's charge. They felt it a precious interval, but both were out of spirits, and could hardly profit by it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311674"><said direct="true">'You will be gone long before we come back,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311675"><said direct="false">'In a fortnight or three weeks, probably.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311676"><said direct="false">'But you will still be able to come to Hollywell now and then?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311677"><said direct="false">'I hope so. It is all the pleasure I can look for. We shall never see such a summer again.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311678"><said direct="false">'Oh, it has been a memorable one!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311679"><said direct="true">'Memorable! Yes. It has given me an assurance that compensates for all I have lost; yet it has made me feel, more than ever before, how poverty withers a man'</said><said direct="false">s hopes.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311680"><said direct="false">'O Philip, I always thought your poverty a great noble thing!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311681"><said direct="false">'You thought like a generous-tempered girl, who has known nothing of its effects.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311682"><said direct="false">'And do you know that Guy says, the thing to be proud of, is of holding the place you do, without the aid of rank or riches.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311683"><said direct="true">'I would not have it otherwise,—I would not for worlds that my father had acted otherwise,'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip. 'You understand that, Laura.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311684"><said direct="false">'Of course I do.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311685"><said direct="true">'But when you speak,—when Guy speaks of my holding the place I do, you little know what it is to feel that powers of usefulness are wasted, to know I have the means of working my way to honour and distinction, such as you would rejoice in, Laura, to have it all within, yet feel it thrown away. Locksley Hall, again,—'</said><said direct="false">every door is barred with gold, and opens but to golden keys.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311686"><said direct="true">'I wish there was anything to be done,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311687"><said direct="false">'It is my profession that is the bar to everything. I have sold the best years of my life, and for what? To see my sister degrade herself by that marriage.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311688"><said direct="true">'That is the real grief,'</said><said direct="false"> said Laura.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311689"><said direct="true">'But for that, I should never have cast a look back on what I relinquished. However, why do I talk of these things, these vain regrets? They only recurred because my welfare does not concern myself alone,— and here'</said><said direct="false">s your father.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311690"><said direct="false">Mr. Edmonstone returned, out of breath, in too much bustle to remark his daughter's blushes. Even when the train was moving off, he still had his head out at the window, calling to Philip that they should expect a visit from him as soon as ever they returned.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311691"><said direct="false">Such cordiality gave Philip a pang; and in bitterness of spirit he walked back to the barracks. On the way he met Mrs. Deane, who wanted to consult him about inviting his cousin, Sir Guy, to a dinner-party she intended to give next week. 'Such an agreeable, sensible youth, and we feel we owe him some attention, he took so much pains to make apologies about the ball.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311692"><said direct="false">'I dare say he will be very happy to come.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311693"><said direct="false">'We will write at once. He is a very fine young man, without a shade of vanity or nonsense.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311694"><said direct="false">'Yes, he has very pleasant, unaffected manners.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311695"><said direct="false">'I am sure he will do credit to his estate. It is a very handsome fortune, is it not?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311696"><said direct="false">'It is a very large property.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311697"><said direct="false">'I am glad of it; I have no doubt we shall see him one of the first men of his time.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311698"><said direct="false">These words brought into contrast in Philip's mind the difference between Guy's position and his own. The mere possession of wealth was winning for Guy, at an age when his merits could only be negative, that estimation which his own tried character had scarcely achieved, placing him not merely on a level with himself, but in a situation where happiness and influence came unbidden. His own talent, attainments, and equal, if not superior claims, to gentle blood, could not procure him what seemed to lie at Guy's feet. His own ability and Laura's heart alone were what wealth could not affect, yet when he thought how the want of it wasted the one, and injured the hopes of the other, he recurred to certain visions of his sister Margaret's, in days gone by, of what he was to do as Sir Philip, lord of Redcliffe. He was speculating on what would have happened had Guy died in his sickly infancy, when, suddenly recollecting himself, he turned his mind to other objects.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311699"><said direct="false">Guy was not much charmed with Mrs. Deane's invitation. He said he knew he must go, to make up for his rudeness about the ball; but he grumbled enough to make Mrs. Edmonstone laugh at him for being so stupid as to want to stay hum-drum in the chimney corner. No doubt it was very pleasant there. There was that peculiar snugness which belongs to a remnant of a large party, when each member of it feels bound to prevent the rest from being dull. Guy devoted himself to Charles more than ever, and in the fear that he might miss the late variety of amusement, exerted even more of his powers of entertainment than Lady Eveleen had called forth.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311700"><said direct="false">There were grave readings in the mornings, and long walks in the afternoons, when he dragged Charles, in his chair, into many a place he had never expected to see again, and enabled him to accompany his mother and sisters in many a delightful expedition. In the evening there was music, or light reading, especially poetry, as this was encouraged by Mrs. Edmonstone, in the idea that it was better that so excitable and enthusiastic a person as Guy should have his objects of admiration tested by Charles's love of ridicule.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311701"><said direct="false">Mr. Edmonstone had left to Guy the office of keeping the 1st of September, one which he greatly relished. Indeed, when he thought of his own deserted manors, he was heard to exclaim, in commiseration for the neglect, 'Poor partridges!' The Hollywell shooting was certainly not like that at Redclyffe, where he could hardly walk out of his own grounds, whereas here he had to bear in mind so many boundaries, that Philip was expecting to have to help him out of some direful scrape. He had generally walked over the whole extent, and assured himself that the birds were very wild, and Bustle the best of dogs, before breakfast, so as to be ready for all the occupations of the day. He could scarcely be grateful when the neighbours, thinking it must be very dull for him to be left alone with Mrs. Edmonstone and her crippled son, used to ask him to shoot or dine. He always lamented at first, and ended by enjoying himself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311702"><said direct="false">One night, he came home in such a state of eagerness, that he must needs tell his good news; and, finding no one in the drawing-room, he ran up-stairs, opened Charles's door, and exclaimed,—'There's to be a concert at Broadstone!' Then perceiving that Charles was fast asleep, he retreated noiselessly, reserving his rejoicings till morning, when it appeared that Charles had heard, but had woven the announcement into a dream.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311703"><said direct="false">This concert filled Guy's head. His only grief was that it was to be in the evening, so that Charles could not go to it, and his wonder was not repressed at finding that Philip did not mean to favour it with his presence, since Guy would suffice for squire to Mrs. Edmonstone and her daughters.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311704"><said direct="false">In fact, Philip was somewhat annoyed by the perpetual conversation about the concert, and on the day on which it was to take place, resolved on making a long expedition to visit the ruins of an old abbey, far out of all reports of it. As he was setting out, he was greeted, in a very loud voice, by Mr. Gordon.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311705"><said direct="true">'Hollo, Morville! how are you? So you have great doings to-night, I hear!'</said><said direct="false"> and he had only just forced himself from him, when he was again accosted, this time in a hasty, embarrassed manner,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311706"><said direct="false">'I beg your pardon, sir, but the ties of relationship—'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311707"><said direct="false">He drew himself up as if he was on parade, faced round, and replied with an emphatic 'Sir!' as he beheld a thin, foreign-looking man, in a somewhat flashy style of dress, who, bowing low, repeated breathlessly,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311708"><said direct="false">'I beg your pardon—Sir Guy Morville, I believe?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311709"><said direct="false">'Captain Morville, sir.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311710"><said direct="true">'I beg your pardon—I mistook. A thousand pardons,'</said><said direct="false"> and he retreated; while Philip, after a moment's wonder, pursued his walk.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311711"><said direct="false">The Hollywell party entered Broadstone in a very different temper, and greatly did they enjoy the concert, both for themselves and for each other. In the midst of it, while Amy was intent on the Italian words of a song, Guy touched her hand, and pointed to a line in the programme—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311712"><said direct="false">Solo on the Violin ... Mr. S. B. Dixon.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311713"><said direct="false">She looked up in his face with an expression full of inquiry; but it was no time for speaking, and she only saw how the colour mantled on his cheek when the violinist appeared, and how he looked down the whole time of the performance, only now and then venturing a furtive though earnest glance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311714"><said direct="false">He did not say anything till they were seated in the carriage, and then astonished Mrs. Edmonstone by exclaiming,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311715"><said direct="true">'It must be my uncle!—I am sure it must. I'</said><said direct="false">ll ride to Broadstone the first thing to-morrow, and find him out.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311716"><said direct="true">'Your uncle!'</said><said direct="false"> exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone. 'I never thought of that.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311717"><said direct="true">'S. B. Dixon!'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy. 'I know his name is Sebastian. It cannot be any one else. You know he went to America. How curious it is! I suppose there is no fear of his being gone before I can come in to-morrow?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311718"><said direct="false">'I should think not. Those musical people keep late hours.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311719"><said direct="false">'I would go before breakfast. Perhaps it would be best to go to old Redford, he will know all about him; or to the music-shop. I am so glad! It is the very thing I always wished.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311720"><said direct="true">'Did you?'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone to herself. 'I can't say every one would be of your mind; but I can't help liking you the better for it. I wish the man had kept further off. I wish Mr. Edmonstone was at home. I hope no harm will come of it. I wonder what I ought to do. Shall I caution him? No; I don't think I can spoil his happiness—and perhaps the man may be improved. He is his nearest relation, and I have no right to interfere. His own good sense will protect him—but I wish Mr. Edmonstone was at home.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311721"><said direct="false">She therefore did not check his expressions of delight, nor object to his going to Broadstone early the next morning. He had just dismounted before the inn-yard, when a boy put a note into his hand, and he was so absorbed in its contents, that he did not perceive Philip till after two greetings had passed unheard. When at length he was recalled, he started, and exclaimed, rapturously, as he put the note into his cousin's hand,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311722"><said direct="false">'See here—it is himself!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311723"><said direct="false">'Who?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311724"><said direct="true">'My uncle. My poor mother'</said><said direct="false">s own brother.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311725"><said direct="true">'Sebastian Bach Dixon,'</said><said direct="false"> read Philip. 'Ha! it was he who took me for you yesterday.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311726"><said direct="false">'I saw him at the concert—I was sure it could be no other. I came in on purpose to find him, and here he is waiting for me. Is not it a happy chance?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311727"><said direct="true">'Happy!'</said><said direct="false"> echoed Philip, in a far different tone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311728"><said direct="true">'How I have longed for this—for any one who could remember and tell me of her—of my mother—my poor, dear young mother! And her own brother! I have been thinking of it all night, and he knows I am here, and is as eager as myself. He is waiting for me,'</said><said direct="false"> ended Guy, hurrying off.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311729"><said direct="true">'Stop!'</said><said direct="false"> said Philip, gravely. 'Think before acting. I seriously advise you to have nothing to do with this man, at least personally. Let me see him, and learn what he wants.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311730"><said direct="true">'He wants me,'</said><said direct="false"> impatiently answered Guy. 'You are not his nephew.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311731"><said direct="true">'Thank heaven!'</said><said direct="false"> thought Philip. 'Do you imagine your relationship is the sole cause of his seeking you?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311732"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t know—I don't care!' cried Guy, with vehemence. 'I will not listen to suspicions of my mother's brother.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311733"><said direct="true">'It is more than suspicion. Hear me calmly. I speak for your good. I know this man'</said><said direct="false">s influence was fatal to your father. I know he did all in his power to widen the breach with your grandfather.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311734"><said direct="true">'That was eighteen years ago,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, walking on, biting his lip in a fiery fit of impatience.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311735"><said direct="false">'You will not hear. Remember, that his position and associates render him no fit companion for you. Nay, listen patiently. You cannot help the relationship. I would not have you do otherwise than assist him. Let him not complain of neglect, but be on your guard. He will either seriously injure you, or be a burden for life.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311736"><said direct="true">'I have heard you so far—I can hear no more,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, no longer restraining his impetuosity. 'He is my uncle, that I know; I care for nothing else. Position —nonsense! what has that to do with it? I will not be set against him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311737"><said direct="false">He strode off; but in a few moments turned back, overtook Philip, said,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311738"><said direct="true">'Thank you for your advice. I beg your pardon for my hastiness. You mean kindly, but I must see my uncle.'</said><said direct="false"> And, without waiting for an answer, he was gone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311739"><said direct="false">In short space he was in the little parlour of the music-shop, shaking hands with his uncle, and exclaiming,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311740"><said direct="false">'I am so glad!—I hoped it was you!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311741"><said direct="true">'It is very noble-hearted! I might have known it would be so with the son of my dearest sister and of my generous friend!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Mr. Dixon, with eagerness that had a theatrical air, though it was genuine feeling that filled his eyes with tears.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311742"><said direct="true">'I saw your name last night,'</said><said direct="false"> continued Guy. 'I would have tried to speak to you at once, but I was obliged to stay with Mrs. Edmonstone, as I was the only gentleman with her.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311743"><said direct="false">'Ah! I thought it possible you might not be able to follow the dictates of your own heart; but this is a fortunate conjuncture, in the absence of your guardian.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311744"><said direct="false">Guy recollected Philip's remonstrance, and it crossed him whether his guardian might be of the same mind; but he felt confident in having told all to Mrs. Edmonstone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311745"><said direct="true">'How did you know I was here?'</said><said direct="false"> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311746"><said direct="true">'I learnt it in a most gratifying way. Mr. Redford, without knowing our connexion—for on that I will always be silent—mentioned that the finest tenor he had ever known, in an amateur, belonged to his pupil, Sir Guy Morville. You can imagine my feelings at finding you so near, and learning that you had inherited your dear mother'</said><said direct="false">s talent and taste.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311747"><said direct="false">The conversation was long, for there was much to hear. Mr. Dixon had kept up a correspondence at long intervals with Markham, from whom he heard that his sister's child survived, and was kindly treated by his grandfather; and inquiring again on the death of old Sir Guy, learnt that he was gone to live with his guardian, whose name and residence Markham had not thought fit to divulge. He had been much rejoiced to hear his name from the music-master, and he went on to tell how he had been misled by the name of Morville into addressing the captain, who had a good deal of general resemblance to Guy's father, a fine tall young man, of the same upright, proud deportment. He supposed he was the son of the Archdeacon, and remembering how strongly his own proceedings had been discountenanced at Stylehurst, had been much disconcerted; and deeming the encounter a bad omen, had used more caution in his advances to his nephew. It was from sincere affection that he sought his acquaintance, though very doubtful as to the reception he might meet, and was both delighted and surprised at such unembarrassed, open-hearted affection.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311748"><said direct="false">The uncle and nephew were not made to understand each other. Sebastian Dixon was a man of little education, and when, in early youth, his talents had placed him high in his own line, he had led a careless, extravagant life. Though an evil friend, and fatal counsellor, he had been truly attached to Guy's father, and the secret engagement, and runaway marriage with his beautiful sister, had been the romance of his life, promoted by him with no selfish end. He was a proud and passionate man, and resenting Sir Guy's refusal to receive his sister as a daughter, almost as much as Sir Guy was incensed at the marriage, had led his brother-in-law to act in a manner which cut off the hope of reconciliation, and obliged Archdeacon Morville to give up his cause. He had gloried in supporting his sister and her husband, and enabling them to set the old baronet at defiance. But young Morville's territorial pride could not brook that he should be maintained, and especially that his child, the heir of Redclyffe, should be born while he was living, at the expense of a musician. This feeling, aided by a yearning for home, and a secret love for his father, mastered his resentment; he took his resolution, quarrelled with Dixon, and carried off his wife, bent with desperation on forcing his father into receiving her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311749"><said direct="false">Sebastian had not surmounted his anger at this step when he learnt its fatal consequences. Ever since that time, nothing had prospered with him: he had married, and sunk himself lower, and though he had an excellent engagement, the days were past when he was the fashion, and his gains and his triumphs were not what they had been. He had a long list of disappointments and jealousies with which to entertain Guy, who, on his side, though resolved to like him, and dreading to be too refined to be friends with his relations, could not feel as thoroughly pleased as he intended to have been.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311750"><said direct="false">Music was, however, a subject on which they could meet with equal enthusiasm, and by means of this, together with the aid of his own imagination, Guy contrived to be very happy. He stayed with his uncle as long as he could, and promised to spend a day with him in London, on his way to Oxford, in October.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311751"><said direct="false">The next morning, when Philip knew that Guy would be with his tutor, he walked to Hollywell, came straight up to his aunt's dressing-room, asked her to send Charlotte down to practise, and, seating himself opposite to her, began,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311752"><said direct="false">'What do you mean to do about this unfortunate rencontre?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311753"><said direct="false">'Do you mean Guy and his uncle? He is very much pleased, poor boy! I like his entire freedom from false shame.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311754"><said direct="false">'A little true shame would be hardly misplaced about such a connexion!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311755"><said direct="true">'It is not his fault, and I hope it will not be his misfortune,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311756"><said direct="true">'That it will certainly be,'</said><said direct="false"> replied Philip, 'if we are not on our guard; and, indeed, if we are, there is little to be done with one so wilful. I might as well have interfered with the course of a whirlwind.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311757"><said direct="false">'No, no, Philip; he is too candid to be wilful.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311758"><said direct="false">'I cannot be of your opinion, when I have seen him rushing into this acquaintance, in spite of the warnings he must have had here—to say nothing of myself.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311759"><said direct="false">'Nay, there I must defend him, though you will think me very unwise; I could not feel that I ought to withhold him from taking some notice of so near a relation.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311760"><said direct="false">Philip did think her so unwise, that he could only reply, gravely,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311761"><said direct="false">'We must hope it may produce no evil effects.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311762"><said direct="true">'How!'</said><said direct="false"> she exclaimed, much alarmed. 'Have you heard anything against him?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311763"><said direct="true">'You remember, of course, that Guy'</said><said direct="false">s father was regularly the victim of this Dixon.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311764"><said direct="true">'Yes, yes; but he has had enough to sober him. Do you know nothing more?'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone, growing nervously anxious lest she had been doing wrong in her husband's absence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311765"><said direct="false">'I have been inquiring about him from old Redford, and I should judge him to be a most dangerous companion; as, indeed, I could have told from his whole air, which is completely that of a roué .'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311766"><said direct="false">'You have seen him, then?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311767"><said direct="false">'Yes. He paid me the compliment of taking me for Sir Guy, and of course made off in dismay when he discovered on whom he had fallen. I have seldom seen a less creditable-looking individual.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311768"><said direct="false">'But what did Mr. Redford say? Did he know of the connexion?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311769"><said direct="true">'No; I am happy to say he did not. The fellow has decency enough not to boast of that. Well, Redford did not know much of him personally; he said he had once been much thought of, and had considerable talent and execution: but taste changes, or he has lost something, so that though he stands tolerably high in his profession, he is not a leader. So much for his musical reputation. As to his character, he is one of those people who are called no one'</said><said direct="false">s enemy but their own, exactly the introduction, Guy has hitherto happily wanted, to every sort of mischief.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311770"><said direct="true">'I think,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying to console herself, 'that Guy is too much afraid of small faults to be invited by larger evils. While he punishes himself for an idle word, he is not likely to go wrong in greater matters.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311771"><said direct="false">'Not at present.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311772"><said direct="false">'Is the man in debt or difficulties? Guy heard nothing of that, and I thought it a good sign.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311773"><said direct="true">'I don'</said><said direct="false">t suppose he is. He ought not, for he has a fixed salary, besides what he gets by playing at concerts when it is not the London season. The wasting money on a spendthrift relation would be a far less evil than what I apprehend.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311774"><said direct="false">'I wish I knew what to do! It is very unlucky that your uncle is from home.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311775"><said direct="false">'Very.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311776"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone was frightened by the sense of responsibility, and was only anxious to catch hold of something to direct her.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311777"><said direct="true">'What would you have me do?'</said><said direct="false"> she asked, helplessly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311778"><said direct="false">'Speak seriously to Guy. He must attend to you; he cannot fly out with a woman as he does with me. Show him the evils that must result from such an intimacy. If Dixon was in distress, I would not say a word, for he would be bound to assist him; but as it is, the acquaintance can serve no purpose but degrading Guy, and showing him the way to evil. Above all, make a point of his giving up visiting him in London. That is the sure road to evil. A youth of his age, under the conduct of a worn-out roué , connected with the theatres! I can hardly imagine anything more mischievous.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311779"><said direct="true">'Yes, yes; I will speak to him,'</said><said direct="false"> said Mrs. Edmonstone, perfectly appalled.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311780"><said direct="false">She promised, but she found the fulfilment difficult, in her dislike to vexing Guy, her fear of saying what was wrong, and a doubt, whether the appearance of persecuting Mr. Dixon, was not the very way to prevent Guy's own good sense from finding out his true character; so she waited, hoping Mr. Edmonstone might return before Guy went to Oxford, or that he might write decisively.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311781"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone might have known her husband better than to expect him to write decisively when he had neither herself nor Philip at his elbow. The same post had brought him a letter from Guy, mentioning his meeting with his uncle, and frankly explaining his plans for London; another from Philip, calling on him to use all his authority to prevent this intercourse, and a third from his wife. Bewildered between them, he took them to his sister, who, being as puzzle-headed as himself, and only hearing his involved history of the affair, confused him still more; so he wrote to Philip, saying he was sorry the fellow had turned up, but he would guard against him. He told Guy he was sorry to say that his uncle used to be a sad scamp, and he must take care, or it would be his poor father's story over again; and to Mrs. Edmonstone he wrote that it was very odd that everything always did go wrong when he was away.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311782"><said direct="false">He thought these letters a great achievement, but his wife's perplexity was not materially relieved.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311783"><said direct="false">After considering a good while, she at length spoke to Guy; but it was not at a happy time, for Philip, despairing of her, had just taken on himself to remonstrate, and had angered him to the verge of an outbreak.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311784"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone, as mildly as she could, urged on him that such intercourse could bring him little satisfaction, and might be very inconvenient; that his uncle was in no distress, and did not require assistance; and that it was too probable that in seeking him out he might meet with persons who might unsettle his principles, —in short, that he had much better give up the visit to London.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311785"><said direct="true">'This is Philip'</said><said direct="false">s advice,' said Guy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311786"><said direct="false">'It is; but—'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311787"><said direct="false">Guy looked impatient, and she paused.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311788"><said direct="true">'You must forgive me,'</said><said direct="false"> he said, 'if I follow my own judgment. If Mr. Edmonstone chose to lay his commands on me, I suppose I must submit; but I cannot see that I am bound to obey Philip.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311789"><said direct="false">'Not to obey, certainly; but his advice—'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311790"><said direct="true">'He is prejudiced and unjust,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy. 'I don't believe that my uncle would attempt to lead me into bad company; and surely you would not have me neglect or look coldly on one who was so much attached to my parents. If he is not a gentleman, and is looked down on by the world, it is not for his sister's son to make him conscious of it.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311791"><said direct="false">'I like your feeling, Guy; I can say nothing against it, but that I am much afraid your uncle is not highly principled.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311792"><said direct="true">'You have only Philip'</said><said direct="false">s account of him.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311793"><said direct="false">'You are resolved?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311794"><said direct="true">'Yes. I do not like not to take your advice, but I do believe this is my duty. I do not think my determination is made in self will,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, thoughtfully; 'I cannot think that I ought to neglect my uncle, because I happen to have been born in a different station, which is all I have heard proved against him,' he added, smiling. 'You will forgive me, will you not, for not following your advice? for really and truly, if you will let me say so, I think you would not have given it if Philip had not been talking to you.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311795"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone confessed, with a smile, that perhaps it was so; but said she trusted much to Philip's knowledge of the world. Guy agreed to this; though still declaring Philip had no right to set him against his uncle, and there the discussion ended.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311796"><said direct="false">Guy went to London. Philip thought him very wilful and his aunt very weak; and Mr. Edmonstone, on coming home, said it could not be helped, and he wished to hear no more about the matter.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311797"><said direct="false">One summer's day, two years after the ball and review, Mary Ross and her father were finishing their early dinner, when she said,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311798"><said direct="true">'If you don'</said><said direct="false">t want me this afternoon, papa, I think I shall walk to Hollywell. You know Eveleen de Courcy is there.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311799"><said direct="false">'No, I did not. What has brought her?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311800"><said direct="false">'As Charles expresses it, she has over-polked herself in London, and is sent here for quiet and country air. I want to call on her, and to ask Sir Guy to give me some idea as to the singing the children should practise for the school feast.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311801"><said direct="false">'Then you think Sir Guy will come to the feast?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311802"><said direct="true">'I reckon on him to conceal all the deficiencies in the children'</said><said direct="false">s singing.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311803"><said direct="false">'He wont desert you, as he did Mrs. Brownlow?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311804"><said direct="false">'O papa! you surely did not think him to blame in that affair?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311805"><said direct="false">'Honestly, Mary, if I thought about the matter at all, I thought it a pity he should go so much to the Brownlows.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311806"><said direct="false">'I believe I could tell you the history, if you thought it worth while; and though it may be gossip, I should like you to do justice to Sir Guy.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311807"><said direct="true">'Very well; though I don'</said><said direct="false">t think there is much danger of my doing otherwise. I only wondered he should become intimate there at all.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311808"><said direct="false">'I believe Mrs. Edmonstone thinks it right he should see as much of the world as possible, and not be always at home in their own set.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311809"><said direct="false">'Fair and proper.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311810"><said direct="false">'You know, she has shown him all the people she could,—had Eveleen staying there, and the Miss Nortons, and hunted him out to parties, when he had rather have been at home.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311811"><said direct="false">'I thought he was fond of society. I remember your telling me how amused you were with his enjoyment of his first ball.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311812"><said direct="true">'Ah! he was two years younger then, and all was new. He seems to me too deep and sensitive not to find more pain than pleasure in commonplace society. I have sometimes seen that he cannot speak either lightly or harshly of what he disapproves, and people don'</said><said direct="false">t understand him. I was once sitting next him, when there was some talking going on about an elopement; he did not laugh, looked almost distressed, and at last said, in a very low voice, to me, 'I wish people would not laugh about such things.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311813"><said direct="false">'He is an extraordinary mixture of gaiety of heart and seriousness.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311814"><said direct="false">'Well, when Mrs. Brownlow had her nieces with her, and was giving those musical parties, his voice made him valuable; and Mrs. Edmonstone told him he ought to go to them. I believe he liked it at first, but he found there was no end to it; it took up a great deal of time, and was a style of thing altogether that was not desirable. Mrs. Edmonstone thought at first his reluctance was only shyness and stay-at-home nonsense, that ought to be overcome; but when she had been there; and saw how Mrs. Brownlow beset him, and the unpleasant fuss they made about his singing, she quite came round to his mind, and was very sorry she had exposed him to so much that was disagreeable.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311815"><said direct="false">'Well, Mary, I am glad to hear your account. My impression arose from something Philip Morville said.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311816"><said direct="false">'Captain Morville never can approve of anything Sir Guy does! It is not like Charles.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311817"><said direct="false">'How improved Charles Edmonstone is. He has lost that spirit of repining and sarcasm, and lives as if he had an object.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311818"><said direct="true">'Yes; he employs himself now, and teaches Amy to do the same. You know, after the governess went, we were afraid little Amy would never do anything but wait on Charles, and idle in her pretty gentle way; but when he turned to better things so did she, and her mind has been growing all this time. Perhaps you don'</said><said direct="false">t see it, for she has not lost her likeness to a kitten, and looks all demure silence with the elders, but she takes in what the wise say.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311819"><said direct="false">'She is a very good little thing; and I dare say will not be the worse for growing up slowly.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311820"><said direct="false">'Those two sisters are specimens of fast and slow growth. Laura has always seemed to be so much more than one year older than Amy, especially of late. She is more like five-and-twenty than twenty. I wonder if she overworks herself. But how we have lingered over our dinner!'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311821"><said direct="false">By half-past three, Mary was entering a copse which led into Mr. Edmonstone's field, when she heard gay tones, and a snatch of one of the sweetest of old songs,—</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311822"><said direct="false">A merry, clear laugh followed; and a turn in the path showed her Guy, Amy, and Charlotte, busy over a sturdy stock of eglantine. Guy, little changed in these two years,—not much taller, and more agile than robust,—was lopping vigorously with his great pruning-knife, Amabel nursing a bundle of drooping rose branches, Charlotte, her bonnet in a garland of wild sweet-brier, holding the matting, and continually getting entangled in the long thorny wreaths.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311823"><said direct="true">'And here comes the '</said><said direct="false">friar of orders grey,' to tell you so,' exclaimed Guy, as Mary, in her grey dress, came on them.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311824"><said direct="true">'Oh, that is right, dear good friar!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Amy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311825"><said direct="true">'We are so busy,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte; 'Guy has made Mr. Markham send all these choice buds from Redclyffe.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311826"><said direct="true">'Not from the park,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy, 'we don't deal much in gardening; but Markham is a great florist, and these are his bounties.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311827"><said direct="false">'And are you cutting that beautiful wild rose to pieces?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311828"><said direct="true">'Is it not a pity?'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy. 'We have used up all the stocks in the garden, and this is to be transplanted in the autumn.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311829"><said direct="true">'She has been consoling it all the time by telling it it is for its good,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy; 'cutting off wild shoots, and putting in better things.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311830"><said direct="true">'I never said anything so pretty; and, after all, I don'</said><said direct="false">t know that the grand roses will be equal to these purple shoots and blushing buds with long whiskers.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311831"><said direct="false">'So Sir Guy was singing about the violets plucked to comfort you. But you must not leave off, I want to see how you do it. I am gardener enough to like to look on.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311832"><said direct="false">'We have only two more to put in.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311833"><said direct="false">Knife and fingers were busy, and Mary admired the dexterity with which the slit was made in the green bark, well armed with firm red thorns, and the tiny scarlet gem inserted, and bound with cotton and matting. At the least critical parts of the work, she asked after the rest of the party, and was answered that papa had driven Charles out in the pony carriage, and that Laura and Eveleen were sitting on the lawn, reading and working with mamma. Eveleen was better, but not strong, or equal to much exertion in the heat. Mary went on to speak of her school feast and ask her question.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311834"><said direct="true">'O Guy, you must not go before that!'</said><said direct="false"> cried Charlotte.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311835"><said direct="false">'Are you going away?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311836"><said direct="true">'He is very naughty, indeed,'</said><said direct="false"> said Charlotte. 'He is going, I don't know where all, to be stupid, and read mathematics.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311837"><said direct="true">'A true bill, I am sorry to say,'</said><said direct="false"> said Guy. 'I am to join a reading-party for the latter part of the vacation.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311838"><said direct="false">'I hope not before Thursday week, though we are not asking you to anything worth staying for.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311839"><said direct="true">'Oh, surely you need not go before that,'</said><said direct="false"> said Amy, 'need you?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311840"><said direct="false">'No; I believe I may stay till Friday, and I should delight in the feast, thank you, Miss Ross,—I want to study such things. A bit more matting, Amy, if you please. There, I think that will do.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311841"><said direct="false">'Excellently. Here is its name. See how neatly Charlie has printed it, Mary. Is it not odd, that he prints so well when he writes so badly?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311842"><said direct="true">''</said><said direct="false">The Seven Sisters.' There, fair sisterhood, grow and thrive, till I come to transplant you in the autumn. Are there any more?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311843"><said direct="false">'No, that is the last. Now, Mary, let us come to mamma.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311844"><said direct="false">Guy waited to clear the path of the numerous trailing briery branches, and the others walked on, Amy telling how sorry they were to lose Guy's vacation, but that he thought he could not give time enough to his studies here, and had settled, at Oxford, to make one of a reading-party, under the tutorship of his friend Mr. Wellwood.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311845"><said direct="false">'Where do they go?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311846"><said direct="true">'It is not settled. Guy wished it to be the sea-side; but Philip has been recommending a farmhouse in Stylehurst parish, rather nearer St. Mildred'</said><said direct="false">s Wells than Stylehurst, but quite out in the moor, and an immense way from both.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311847"><said direct="false">'Do you think it will be the place?'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311848"><said direct="true">'Yes; Guy thinks it would suit Mr. Wellwood, because he has friends at St. Mildred'</said><said direct="false">s, so he gave his vote for it. He expects to hear how it is settled to-day or to-morrow.'</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311849"><said direct="false">Coming out on the lawn, they found the three ladies sitting under the acacia, with their books and work. Laura did, indeed, look older than her real age, as much above twenty as Amy looked under nineteen. She was prettier than ever; her complexion exquisite in delicacy, her fine figure and the perfect outline of her features more developed; but the change from girl to woman had passed over her, and set its stamp on the anxious blue eye and almost oppressed brow. Mary thought it would be hard to define where was that difference. It was not want of bloom, for of that Laura had more than any of the others, fresh, healthy, and bright, while Amy was always rather pale, and Lady Eveleen was positively wan and faded by London and late hours; nor was it loss of animation, for Laura talked and laughed with interest and eagerness; nor was it thought, for little Amy, when at rest, wore a meditative, pensive countenance; but there was something either added or taken away, which made it appear that the serenity and carelessness of early youth had fled from her, and the air of the cares of life had come over her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311850"><said direct="false">Mary told her plans,—Church service at four, followed by a tea-drinking in the fields; tea in the garden for the company, and play for the school children and all who liked to join them. Everyone likes such festivals, which have the recommendation of permitting all to do as they please, bringing friends together in perfect ease and freedom, with an object that raises them above the rank of mere gatherings for the pleasure of rich neighbours.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311851"><said direct="false">Mrs. Edmonstone gladly made the engagement, and Lady Eveleen promised to be quite well, and to teach the children all manner of new games, though she greatly despised the dulness of English children, and had many droll stories of the stupidity of Laura's pupils, communicated to her, with perhaps a little exaggeration, by Charles, and still further embellished by herself, for the purpose of exciting Charlotte's indignation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG185311852"><said direct="false">Mary proceeded to her consultation about the singing, and was conducted by Guy and Amy to the piano, and when her ears could not be indoctrinated by their best efforts, they more than half engaged to walk to East Hill, and have a conversation with the new school-master, whom Mary pitied for having fallen on people so unable to appreciate his musical training as herself and her father. The whole party walked back with her as far as the shade lasted; and at the end of the next field she turned, saw them standing round the stile, thought what happy people they were, and then resumed her wonder whither Laura's youthfulness had flown.</said></p>
