<sample><p n="ENG190901224"><said direct=False>I felt her standing behind me as I spoke to the cab man.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901225"><said direct=False>I got into the cab, resolutely not looking back, and then as it started jumped up, craned out and looked at the door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901226"><said direct=False>It was wide open, but she had disappeared....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901227"><said direct=False>I wonder-I suppose she ran upstairs.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901228"><said direct=False>So I parted from Marion at an extremity of perturbation and regret, and went, as I had promised and arranged, to Effie, who was waiting for me in apartments near Orpington. I remember her upon the station platform, a bright, flitting figure looking along the train for me, and our walk over the fields in the twilight. I had expected an immense sense of relief where at last the stresses of separation were over, but now I found I was beyond measure wretched and perplexed, full of the profoundest persuasion of irreparable error. The dusk and somber Marion were so alike, her sorrow seemed to be all about me. I had to hold myself to my own plans, to remember that I must keep faith with Effie, with Effie who had made no terms, exacted no guarantees, but flung herself into my hands.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901229"><said direct=False>We went across the evening fields in silence, towards a sky of deepening gold and purple, and Effie was close beside me always, very close, glancing up ever and again at my face.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901230"><said direct=False>Certainly she knew I grieved for Marion, that ours was now no joyful reunion. But she showed no resentment and no jealousy. Extraordinarily, she did not compete against Marion. Never once in all our time together did she say an adverse word of Marion....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901231"><said direct=False>She set herself presently to dispel the shadow that brooded over me with the same instinctive skill that some women will show with the trouble of a child. She made herself my glad and pretty slave and handmaid; she forced me at last to rejoice in her. Yet at the back of it all Marion remained, stupid and tearful and infinitely distressful, so that I was almost intolerably unhappy for her-for her and the dead body of my married love.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901232"><said direct=False>It is all, as I tell it now, unaccountable to me. I go back into these remote parts, these rarely visited uplands and lonely tares of memory, and it seems to me still a strange country. I had thought I might be going to some sensuous paradise with Effie, but desire which fills the universe before its satisfaction, vanishes utterly like the going of daylight-with achievement. All the facts and forms of life remain darkling and cold. It was an upland of melancholy questionings, a region from which I saw all the world at new angles and in new aspects; I had outflanked passion and romance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901233"><said direct=False>I had come into a condition of vast perplexities. For the first time in my life, at least so it seems to me now in this retrospect, I looked at my existence as a whole.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901234"><said direct=False>Since this was nothing, what was I doing? What was I for?</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901235"><said direct=False>I was going to and fro about Tono-Bungay-the business I had taken up to secure Marion and which held me now in spite of our intimate separation-and snatching odd week-ends and nights for Orpington, and all the while I struggled with these obstinate interrogations. I used to fall into musing in the trains, I became even a little inaccurate and forgetful about business things. I have the clearest memory of myself sitting thoughtful in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside that looked toward Seven Oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country, and that I was thinking out my destiny. I could almost write my thought down now, I believe, as they came to me that afternoon. Effie, restless little cockney that she was, rustled and struggled in a hedgerow below, gathering flowers, discovering flowers she had never seen before. I had. I remember, a letter from Marion in my pocket. I had even made some tentatives for return, for a reconciliation; Heaven knows now how I had put it! but her cold, ill-written letter repelled me. I perceived I could never face that old inconclusive dullness of life again, that stagnant disappointment. That, anyhow, wasn't possible. But what was possible? I could see no way of honour or fine living before me at all.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901236"><said direct=True>"What am I to do with life?"</said><said direct=False> that was the question that besieged me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901237"><said direct=False>I wondered if all the world was even as I, urged to this by one motive and to that by another, creatures of chance and impulse and unmeaning traditions. Had I indeed to abide by what I had said and done and chosen? Was there nothing for me in honour but to provide for Effie, go back penitent to Marion and keep to my trade in rubbish-or find some fresh one-and so work out the residue of my days? I didn't accept that for a moment. But what else was I to do? I wondered if my case was the case of many men, whether in former ages, too, men had been so guideless, so uncharted, so haphazard in their journey into life. In the Middle Ages, in the old Catholic days, one went to a priest, and he said with all the finality of natural law, this you are and this you must do. I wondered whether even in the Middle Ages I should have accepted that ruling without question.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901238"><said direct=False>I remember too very distinctly how Effie came and sat beside me on a little box: that was before the casement window of our room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901239"><said direct=True>"Gloomkins,"</said><said direct=False> said she.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901240"><said direct=False>I smiled and remained head on hand, looking out of the window forgetful of her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901241"><said direct=True>"Did you love your wife so well?"</said><said direct=False> she whispered softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901242"><said direct=True>"Oh!"</said><said direct=False> I cried, recalled again; "I don't know. I don't understand these things. Life is a thing that hurts, my dear! It hurts without logic or reason. I've blundered! I didn't understand. Anyhow-there is no need to go hurting you, is there?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901243"><said direct=False>And I turned about and drew her to me, and kissed her ear....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901244"><said direct=False>Yes, I had a very bad time-I still recall. I suffered, I suppose, from a sort of ennui of the imagination. I found myself without an object to hold my will together. I sought. I read restlessly and discursively. I tried Ewart and got no help from him. As I regard it all now in this retrospect, it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims I discovered myself for the first time. Before that I had seen only the world and things in it, had sought them self-forgetful of all but my impulse. Now I found myself GROUPED with a system of appetites and satisfactions, with much work to do-and no desire, it seemed, left in me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901245"><said direct=False>There were moments when I thought of suicide. At times my life appeared before me in bleak, relentless light, a series of ignorances, crude blunderings, degradation and cruelty. I had what the old theologians call a "conviction of sin." I sought salvation-not perhaps in the formula a Methodist preacher would recognise but salvation nevertheless.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901246"><said direct=False>Men find their salvation nowadays in many ways. Names and forms don't, I think, matter very much; the real need is something that we can hold and that holds one. I have known a man find that determining factor in a dry-plate factory, and another in writing a history of the Manor. So long as it holds one, it does not matter. Many men and women nowadays take up some concrete aspect of Socialism or social reform. But Socialism for me has always been a little bit too human, too set about with personalities and foolishness. It isn't my line. I don't like things so human. I don't think I'm blind to the fun, the surprises, the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life, to the "humour of it," as people say, and to adventure, but that isn't the root of the matter with me. There's no humour in my blood. I'm in earnest in warp and woof. I stumble and flounder, but I know that over all these merry immediate things, there are other things that are great and serene, very high, beautiful things-the reality. I haven't got it, but it's there nevertheless. I'm a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses. I've never seen the goddesses nor ever shall-but it takes all the fun out of the mud-and at times I fear it takes all the kindliness, too.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901247"><said direct=False>But I'm talking of things I can't expect the reader to understand, because I don't half understand them myself. There is something links things for me, a sunset or so, a mood or so, the high air, something there was in Marion's form and colour, something I find and lose in Mantegna's pictures, something in the lines of these boats I make. (You should see X2, my last and best!)</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901248"><said direct=False>I can't explain myself, I perceive. Perhaps it all comes to this, that I am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits. Naturally I resist that as a complete solution. Anyhow, I had a sense of inexorable need, of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable, and for a time this aeronautical engineering allayed it....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901249"><said direct=False>In the end of this particular crisis of which I tell so badly, I idealised Science. I decided that in power and knowledge lay the salvation of my life, the secret that would fill my need; that to these things I would give myself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901250"><said direct=False>I emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness, clutching at a new resolve for which he had groped desperately and long.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901251"><said direct=False>I came into the inner office suddenly one day-it must have been just before the time of Marion's suit for restitution-and sat down before my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901252"><said direct=True>"Look here,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "I'm sick of this."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901253"><said direct=True>"HulLO!"</said><said direct=False> he answered, and put some papers aside.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901254"><said direct=True>"What'</said><said direct=False>s up, George?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901255"><said direct=False>"Things are wrong."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901256"><said direct=False>"As how?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901257"><said direct=True>"My life,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "it's a mess, an infinite mess."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901258"><said direct=True>"She'</said><said direct=False>s been a stupid girl, George," he said; "I partly understand. But you're quit of her now, practically, and there's just as good fish in the sea-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901259"><said direct=True>"Oh! it'</said><said direct=False>s not that!" I cried. "That's only the part that shows. I'm sick-I'm sick of all this damned rascality."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901260"><said direct=True>"Eh? Eh?"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle. "WHAT-rascality?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901261"><said direct=True>"Oh, YOU know. I want some STUFF, man. I want something to hold on to. I shall go amok if I don'</said><said direct=False>t get it. I'm a different sort of beast from you. You float in all this bunkum. I feel like a man floundering in a universe of soapsuds, up and downs, east and west. I can't stand it. I must get my foot on something solid or-I don't know what."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901262"><said direct=False>I laughed at the consternation in his face.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901263"><said direct=True>"I mean it,"</said><said direct=False> I said. "I've been thinking it over. I've made up my mind. It's no good arguing. I shall go in for work-real work. No! this isn't work; it's only laborious cheating. But I've got an idea! It's an old idea-I thought of years ago, but it came back to me. Look here! Why should I fence about with you? I believe the time has come for flying to be possible. Real flying!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901264"><said direct=False>"Flying!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901265"><said direct=False>I stuck to that, and it helped me through the worst time in my life. My uncle, after some half-hearted resistance and a talk with my aunt, behaved like the father of a spoilt son. He fixed up an arrangement that gave me capital to play with, released me from too constant a solicitude for the newer business developments-this was in what I may call the later Moggs period of our enterprises-and I went to work at once with grim intensity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901266"><said direct=False>But I will tell of my soaring and flying machines in the proper place. I've been leaving the story of my uncle altogether too long. I wanted merely to tell how it was I took to this work. I took to these experiments after I had sought something that Marion in some indefinable way had seemed to promise. I toiled and forgot myself for a time, and did many things. Science too has been something of an irresponsive mistress since, though I've served her better than I served Marion. But at the time Science, with her order, her inhuman distance, yet steely certainties, saved me from despair.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901267"><said direct=False>Well, I have still to fly; but incidentally I have invented the lightest engines in the world.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901268"><said direct=False>I am trying to tell of all the things that happened to me. It's hard enough simply to get it put down in the remotest degree right. But this is a novel, not a treatise. Don't imagine that I am coming presently to any sort of solution of my difficulties. Here among my drawings and hammerings NOW, I still question unanswering problems. All my life has been at bottom, SEEKING, disbelieving always, dissatisfied always with the thing seen and the thing believed, seeking something in toil, in force, in danger, something whose name and nature I do not clearly understand, something beautiful, worshipful, enduring, mine profoundly and fundamentally, and the utter redemption of myself; I don't know-all I can tell is that it is something I have ever failed to find.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901269"><said direct=False>But before I finish this chapter and book altogether and go on with the great adventure of my uncle's career. I may perhaps tell what else remains to tell of Marion and Effie, and then for a time set my private life behind me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901270"><said direct=False>For a time Marion and I corresponded with some regularity, writing friendly but rather uninforming letters about small business things. The clumsy process of divorce completed itself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901271"><said direct=False>She left the house at Ealing and went into the country with her aunt and parents, taking a small farm near Lewes in Sussex. She put up glass, she put in heat for her father, happy man! and spoke of figs and peaches. The thing seemed to promise well throughout a spring and summer, but the Sussex winter after London was too much for the Ramboats. They got very muddy and dull; Mr. Ramboat killed a cow by improper feeding, and that disheartened them all. A twelvemonth saw the enterprise in difficulties. I had to help her out of this, and then they returned to London and she went into partnership with Smithie at Streatham, and ran a business that was intimated on the firm's stationery as "Robes." The parents and aunt were stowed away in a cottage somewhere. After that the letters became infrequent. But in one I remember a postscript that had a little stab of our old intimacy: "Poor old Miggles is dead."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901272"><said direct=False>Nearly eight years slipped by. I grew up. I grew in experience, in capacity, until I was fully a man, but with many new interests, living on a larger scale in a wider world than I could have dreamt of in my Marion days. Her letters become rare and insignificant. At last came a gap of silence that made me curious. For eighteen months or more I had nothing from Marion save her quarterly receipts through the bank. Then I damned at Smithie, and wrote a card to Marion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901273"><said direct=True>"Dear Marion,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "how goes it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901274"><said direct=False>She astonished me tremendously by telling me she had married again-"a Mr. Wachorn, a leading agent in the paper-pattern trade." But she still wrote on the Ponderevo and Smith (Robes) notepaper, from the Ponderevo and Smith address.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901275"><said direct=False>And that, except for a little difference of opinion about the continuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger, and the use of my name by the firm, which also annoyed me, is the end of Marion's history for me, and she vanishes out of this story. I do not know where she is or what she is doing. I do not know whether she is alive or dead. It seems to me utterly grotesque that two people who have stood so close to one another as she and I should be so separated, but so it is between us.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901276"><said direct=False>Effie, too, I have parted from, though I still see her at times. Between us there was never any intention of marriage nor intimacy of soul. She had a sudden, fierce, hot-blooded passion for me and I for her, but I was not her first lover nor her last. She was in another world from Marion. She had a queer, delightful nature; I've no memory of ever seeing her sullen or malicious. She was-indeed she was magnificently-eupeptic. That, I think, was the central secret of her agreeableness, and, moreover, that she was infinitely kind-hearted. I helped her at last into an opening she coveted, and she amazed me by a sudden display of business capacity. She has now a typewriting bureau in Riffle's Inn, and she runs it with a brisk vigour and considerable success, albeit a certain plumpness has overtaken her. And she still loves her kind. She married a year or so ago a boy half her age-a wretch of a poet, a wretched poet, and given to drugs, a thing with lank fair hair always getting into his blue eyes, and limp legs. She did it, she said, because he needed nursing....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901277"><said direct=False>But enough of this disaster of my marriage and of my early love affairs; I have told all that is needed for my picture to explain how I came to take up aeroplane experiments and engineering science; let me get back to my essential story, to Tono-Bungay and my uncle's promotions and to the vision of the world these things have given me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901278"><said direct=False>But now that I resume the main line of my story it may be well to describe the personal appearance of my uncle as I remember him during those magnificent years that followed his passage from trade to finance. The little man plumped up very considerably during the creation of the Tono-Bungay property, but with the increasing excitements that followed that first flotation came dyspepsia and a certain flabbiness and falling away. His abdomen-if the reader will pardon my taking his features in the order of their value-had at first a nice full roundness, but afterwards it lost tone without, however, losing size. He always went as though he was proud of it and would make as much of it as possible. To the last his movements remained quick and sudden, his short firm legs, as he walked, seemed to twinkle rather than display the scissors-stride of common humanity, and he never seemed to have knees, but instead, a dispersed flexibility of limb.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901279"><said direct=False>There was, I seem to remember, a secular intensification of his features; his nose developed character, became aggressive, stuck out at the world more and more; the obliquity of his mouth, I think, increased. From the face that returns to my memory projects a long cigar that is sometimes cocked jauntily up from the higher corner, that sometimes droops from the lower;-it was as eloquent as a dog's tail, and he removed it only for the more emphatic modes of speech. He assumed a broad black ribbon for his glasses, and wore them more and more askew as time went on. His hair seemed to stiffen with success, but towards the climax it thinned greatly over the crown, and he brushed it hard back over his ears where, however, it stuck out fiercely. It always stuck out fiercely over his forehead, up and forward.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901280"><said direct=False>He adopted an urban style of dressing with the onset of Tono-Bungay and rarely abandoned it. He preferred silk hats with ample rich brims, often a trifle large for him by modern ideas, and he wore them at various angles to his axis; his taste in trouserings was towards fairly emphatic stripes and his trouser cut was neat; he liked his frock-coat long and full, although that seemed to shorten him. He displayed a number of valuable rings, and I remember one upon his left little finger with a large red stone bearing Gnostic symbols. "Clever chaps, those Gnostics, George," he told me. "Means a lot. Lucky!" He never had any but a black mohair watch-chair. In the country he affected grey and a large grey cloth top-hat, except when motoring; then he would have a brown deer-stalker cap and a fur suit of esquimaux cut with a sort of boot-end to the trousers. Of an evening he would wear white waistcoats and plain gold studs. He hated diamonds. "Flashy," he said they were. "Might as well wear-an income tax-receipt. All very well for Park Lane. Unsold stock. Not my style. Sober financier, George."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901281"><said direct=False>So much for his visible presence. For a time it was very familiar to the world, for at the crest of the boom he allowed quite a number of photographs and at least one pencil sketch to be published in the sixpenny papers.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901282"><said direct=False>His voice declined during those years from his early tenor to a flat rich quality of sound that my knowledge of music is inadequate to describe. His Zzz-ing inrush of air became less frequent as he ripened, but returned in moments of excitement. Throughout his career, in spite of his increasing and at last astounding opulence, his more intimate habits remained as simple as they had been at Wimblehurst. He would never avail himself of the services of a valet; at the very climax of his greatness his trousers were folded by a housemaid and his shoulders brushed as he left his house or hotel. He became wary about breakfast as life advanced, and at one time talked much of Dr. Haig and uric acid. But for other meals he remained reasonably omnivorous. He was something of a gastronome, and would eat anything he particularly liked in an audible manner, and perspire upon his forehead. He was a studiously moderate drinker-except when the spirit of some public banquet or some great occasion caught him and bore him beyond his wariness-there he would, as it were, drink inadvertently and become flushed and talkative-about everything but his business projects.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901283"><said direct=False>To make the portrait complete one wants to convey an effect of sudden, quick bursts of movement like the jumps of a Chinese-cracker to indicate that his pose whatever it is, has been preceded and will be followed by a rush. If I were painting him, I should certainly give him for a background that distressed, uneasy sky that was popular in the eighteenth century, and at a convenient distance a throbbing motor-car, very big and contemporary, a secretary hurrying with papers, and an alert chauffeur.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901284"><said direct=False>Such was the figure that created and directed the great property of Tono-Bungay, and from the successful reconstruction of that company passed on to a slow crescendo of magnificent creations and promotions until the whole world of investors marveled. I have already I think, mentioned how, long before we offered Tono Bungay to the public, we took over the English agency of certain American specialties. To this was presently added our exploitation of Moggs' Domestic Soap, and so he took up the Domestic Convenience Campaign that, coupled with his equatorial rotundity and a certain resolute convexity in his bearings won my uncle his Napoleonic title.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901285"><said direct=False>It illustrates the romantic element in modern commerce that my uncle met young Moggs at a city dinner-I think it was the Bottle-makers' Company-when both were some way advanced beyond the initial sobriety of the occasion. This was the grandson of the original Moggs, and a very typical instance of an educated, cultivated, degenerate plutocrat. His people had taken him about in his youth as the Ruskins took their John and fostered a passion for history in him, and the actual management of the Moggs' industry had devolved upon a cousin and a junior partner.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901286"><said direct=False>Mr. Moggs, being of a studious and refined disposition, had just decided-after a careful search for a congenial subject in which he would not be constantly reminded of soap-to devote himself to the History of the Thebaid, when this cousin died suddenly and precipitated responsibilities upon him. In the frankness of conviviality, Moggs bewailed the uncongenial task thus thrust into his hands, and my uncle offered to lighten his burden by a partnership then and there. They even got to terms-extremely muzzy terms, but terms nevertheless.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901287"><said direct=False>Each gentleman wrote the name and address of the other on his cuff, and they separated in a mood of brotherly carelessness, and next morning neither seems to have thought to rescue his shirt from the wash until it was too late. My uncle made a painful struggle-it was one of my business mornings-to recall name and particulars.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901288"><said direct=True>"He was an aquarium-faced, long, blond sort of chap, George, with glasses and a genteel accent,"</said><said direct=False> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901289"><said direct=False>I was puzzled. "Aquarium-faced?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901290"><said direct=True>"You know how they look at you. His stuff was soap, I'</said><said direct=False>m pretty nearly certain. And he had a name-And the thing was the straightest Bit-of-All-right you ever. I was clear enough to spot that..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901291"><said direct=False>We went out at last with knitted brows, and wandered up into Finsbury seeking a good, well-stocked looking grocer. We called first on a chemist for a pick-me-up for my uncle, and then we found the shop we needed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901292"><said direct=True>"I want,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, "half a pound of every sort of soap you got. Yes, I want to take them now. Wait a moment, George.... Now what sort of soap d'you call THAT?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901293"><said direct=False>At the third repetition of that question the young man said, "Moggs' Domestic."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901294"><said direct=True>"Right,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle. "You needn't guess again. Come along, George, let's go to a telephone and get on to Moggs. Oh-the order? Certainly. I confirm it. Send it all-send it all to the Bishop of London; he'll have some good use for it-(First-rate man, George, he is-charities and all that)-and put it down to me, here's a card-Ponderevo-Tono-Bungay."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901295"><said direct=False>Then we went on to Moggs and found him in a camel-hair dressing-jacket in a luxurious bed, drinking China tea, and got the shape of everything but the figures fixed by lunch time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901296"><said direct=False>Young Moggs enlarged my mind considerably; he was a sort of thing I hadn't met before; he seemed quite clean and well-informed and he assured me to never read newspapers nor used soap in any form at all, "Delicate skin," he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901297"><said direct=True>"No objection to our advertising you wide and free?"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901298"><said direct=True>"I draw the line at railway stations,"</said><said direct=False> said Moggs, "south-coast cliffs, theatre programmes, books by me and poetry generally-scenery-oh!-and the Mercure de France."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901299"><said direct=True>"We'</said><said direct=False>ll get along," said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901300"><said direct=True>"So long as you don'</said><said direct=False>t annoy me," said Moggs, lighting a cigarette, "you can make me as rich as you like."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901301"><said direct=False>We certainly made him no poorer. His was the first firm that was advertised by a circumstantial history; we even got to illustrated magazine articles telling of the quaint past of Moggs. We concocted Moggsiana. Trusting to our partner's preoccupation with the uncommercial aspects of life, we gave graceful history-of Moggs the First, Moggs the Second, Moggs the Third, and Moggs the Fourth. You must, unless you are very young, remember some of them and our admirable block of a Georgian shop window. My uncle brought early nineteenth-century memoirs, soaked himself in the style, and devised stories about old Moggs the First and the Duke of Wellington, George the Third and the soap dealer ("almost certainly old Moggs"). Very soon we had added to the original Moggs' Primrose several varieties of scented and superfatted, a "special nurseries used in the household of the Duke of Kent and for the old Queen in Infancy," a plate powder, "the Paragon," and a knife powder. We roped in a good little second-rate black-lead firm, and carried their origins back into the mists of antiquity. It was my uncle's own unaided idea that we should associate that commodity with the Black Prince. He became industriously curious about the past of black-lead. I remember his button-holing the president of the Pepys Society.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901302"><said direct=False>"I say, is there any black-lead in Pepys? You know-black-lead-for grates! OR DOES HE PASS IT OVER AS A MATTER OF COURSE?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901303"><said direct=False>He became in those days the terror of eminent historians. "Don't want your drum and trumpet history-no fear," he used to say. "Don't want to know who was who's mistress, and why so-and-so devastated such a province; that's bound to be all lies and upsy-down anyhow. Not my affair. Nobody's affair now. Chaps who did it didn't clearly know.... What I want to know is, in the Middle Ages, did they do anything for Housemaid's Knee? What did they put in their hot baths after jousting, and was the Black Prince-you know the Black Prince-was he enameled or painted, or what? I think myself, black-leaded-very likely-like pipe-clay-but DID they use blacking so early?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901304"><said direct=False>So it came about that in designing and writing those Moggs' Soap Advertisements, that wrought a revolution in that department of literature, my uncle was brought to realise not only the lost history, but also the enormous field for invention and enterprise that lurked among the little articles, the dustpans and mincers, the mousetraps and carpet-sweepers that fringe the shops of the oilman and domestic ironmonger. He was recalled to one of the dreams of his youth, to his conception of the Ponderevo Patent Flat that had been in his mind so early as the days before I went to serve him at Wimblehurst. "The Home, George," he said, "wants straightening up. Silly muddle! Things that get in the way. Got to organise it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901305"><said direct=False>For a time he displayed something like the zeal of a genuine social reformer in relation to these matters.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901306"><said direct=True>"We'</said><said direct=False>ve got to bring the Home Up to Date? That's my idee, George. We got to make a civilised domestic machine out of these relics of barbarism. I'm going to hunt up inventors, make a corner in d'mestic ideas. Everything. Balls of string that won't dissolve into a tangle, and gum that won't dry into horn. See? Then after conveniences-beauty. Beauty, George! All these few things ought to be made fit to look at; it's your aunt's idea, that. Beautiful jam-pots! Get one of those new art chaps to design all the things they make ugly now. Patent carpet-sweepers by these greenwood chaps, housemaid's boxes it'll be a pleasure to fall over-rich coloured house-flannels. Zzzz. Pails, f'rinstance. Hang 'em up on the walls like warming-pans. All the polishes and things in such tins-you'll want to cuddle 'em, George! See the notion? 'Sted of all the silly ugly things we got."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901307"><said direct=False>We had some magnificent visions; they so affected me that when I passed ironmongers and oil-shops they seemed to me as full of promise as trees in late winter, flushed with the effort to burst into leaf and flower.... And really we did do much towards that very brightness these shops display. They were dingy things in the eighties compared to what our efforts have made them now, grey quiet displays.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901308"><said direct=False>Well, I don't intend to write down here the tortuous financial history of Moggs' Limited, which was our first development of Moggs and Sons; nor will I tell very much of how from that we spread ourselves with a larger and larger conception throughout the chandlery and minor ironmongery, how we became agents for this little commodity, partners in that, got a tentacle round the neck of a specialised manufacturer or so, secured a pull upon this or that supply of raw material, and so prepared the way for our second flotation, Domestic Utilities; "Do it," they reordered it in the city. And then came the reconstruction of Tono-Bungay, and then "Household services" and the Boom!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901309"><said direct=False>That sort of development is not to be told in detail in a novel. I have, indeed, told much of it elsewhere. It is to be found set out at length, painfully at length, in my uncle's examination and mine in the bankruptcy proceedings, and in my own various statements after his death. Some people know everything in that story, some know it all too well, most do not want the details, it is the story of a man of imagination among figures, and unless you are prepared to collate columns of pounds, shillings and pence, compare dates and check additions, you will find it very unmeaning and perplexing. And after all, you wouldn't find the early figures so much wrong as STRAINED. In the matter of Moggs and Do Ut, as in the first Tono-Bungay promotion and in its reconstruction, we left the court by city standards without a stain on our characters. The great amalgamation of Household Services was my uncle's first really big-scale enterprise and his first display of bolder methods: for this we bought back Do Ut, Moggs (going strong with a seven per cent. dividend) and acquired Skinnerton's polishes, the Riffleshaw properties and the Runcorn's mincer and coffee-mill business. To that Amalgamation I was really not a party; I left it to my uncle because I was then beginning to get keen upon the soaring experiments I had taken on from the results then to hand of Lilienthal, Pilcher and the Wright brothers. I was developing a glider into a flyer. I meant to apply power to this glider as soon as I could work out one or two residual problems affecting the longitudinal stability. I knew that I had a sufficiently light motor in my own modification of Bridger's light turbine, but I knew too that until I had cured my aeroplane of a tendency demanding constant alertness from me, a tendency to jerk up its nose at unexpected moments and slide back upon me, the application of an engine would be little short of suicide.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901310"><said direct=False>But that I will tell about later. The point I was coming to was that I did not realise until after the crash how recklessly my uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent. on the ordinary shares of that hugely over-capitalised enterprise, Household Services.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901311"><said direct=False>I drifted out of business affairs into my research much more than either I or my uncle had contemplated. Finance was much less to my taste than the organisation of the Tono-Bungay factory. In the new field of enterprise there was a great deal of bluffing and gambling, of taking chances and concealing material facts-and these are hateful things to the scientific type of mind. It wasn't fear I felt so much as an uneasy inaccuracy. I didn't realise dangers, I simply disliked the sloppy, relaxing quality of this new sort of work. I was at last constantly making excuses not to come up to him in London. The latter part of his business career recedes therefore beyond the circle of any particular life. I lived more or less with him; I talked, I advised, I helped him at times to fight his Sunday crowd at Crest Hill, but I did not follow nor guide him. From the Do Ut time onward he rushed up the financial world like a bubble in water and left me like some busy water-thing down below in the deeps.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901312"><said direct=False>Anyhow, he was an immense success. The public was, I think, particularly attracted by the homely familiarity of his field of work-you never lost sight of your investment they felt, with the name on the house-flannel and shaving-strop-and its allegiance was secured by the Egyptian solidity of his apparent results. Tono-Bungay, after its reconstruction, paid thirteen, Moggs seven, Domestic Utilities had been a safe-looking nine; here was Household Services with eight; on such a showing he had merely to buy and sell Roeburn's Antiseptic fluid, Razor soaks and Bath crystals in three weeks to clear twenty thousand pounds.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901313"><said direct=False>I do think that as a matter of fact Roeburn's was good value at the price at which he gave it to the public, at least until it was strained by ill-conserved advertisement. It was a period of expansion and confidence; much money was seeking investment and "Industrials" were the fashion. Prices were rising all round. There remained little more for my uncle to do therefore, in his climb to the high unstable crest of Financial Greatness but, as he said, to "grasp the cosmic oyster, George, while it gaped," which, being translated, meant for him to buy respectable businesses confidently and courageously at the vendor's estimate, add thirty or forty thousand to the price and sell them again. His sole difficulty indeed was the tactful management of the load of shares that each of these transactions left upon his hands. But I thought so little of these later things that I never fully appreciated the peculiar inconveniences of that until it was too late to help him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901314"><said direct=False>When I think of my uncle near the days of his Great Boom and in connection with the actualities of his enterprises, I think of him as I used to see him in the suite of rooms he occupied in the Hardingham Hotel, seated at a great old oak writing-table, smoking, drinking, and incoherently busy; that was his typical financial aspect-our evenings, our mornings, our holidays, our motor-car expeditions, Lady Grove and Crest Hill belong to an altogether different set of memories.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901315"><said direct=False>These rooms in the Hardingham were a string of apartments along one handsome thick-carpeted corridor. All the doors upon the corridor were locked except the first; and my uncle's bedroom, breakfast-room and private sanctum were the least accessible and served by an entrance from the adjacent passage, which he also used at times as a means of escape from importunate callers. The most eternal room was a general waiting-room and very business-like in quality; it had one or two uneasy sofas, a number of chairs, a green baize table, and a collection of the very best Moggs and Tone posters: and the plush carpets normal to the Hardingham had been replaced by a grey-green cork linoleum; Here I would always find a remarkable miscellany of people presided over by a peculiarly faithful and ferocious looking commissioner, Ropper, who guarded the door that led a step nearer my uncle. Usually there would be a parson or so, and one or two widows; hairy, eyeglassy, middle-aged gentlemen, some of them looking singularly like Edward Ponderevos who hadn't come off, a variety of young and youngish men more or less attractively dressed, some with papers protruding from their pockets, others with their papers decently concealed. And wonderful, incidental, frowsy people.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901316"><said direct=False>All these persons maintained a practically hopeless siege-sometimes for weeks together; they had better have stayed at home. Next came a room full of people who had some sort of appointment, and here one would find smart-looking people, brilliantly dressed, nervous women hiding behind magazines, nonconformist divines, clergy in gaiters, real business men, these latter for the most part gentlemen in admirable morning dress who stood up and scrutinised my uncle's taste in water colours manfully and sometimes by the hour together. Young men again were here of various social origins, young Americans, treasonable clerks from other concerns, university young men, keen-looking, most of them, resolute, reserved, but on a sort of hair trigger, ready at any moment to be most voluble, most persuasive.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901317"><said direct=False>This room had a window, too, looking out into the hotel courtyard with its fern-set fountains and mosaic pavement, and the young men would stand against this and sometimes even mutter. One day I heard one repeating in all urgent whisper as I passed "But you don't quite see, Mr. Ponderevo, the full advantages, the FULL advantages-" I met his eye and he was embarrassed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901318"><said direct=False>Then came a room with a couple of secretaries-no typewriters, because my uncle hated the clatter-and a casual person or two sitting about, projectors whose projects were being entertained. Here and in a further room nearer the private apartments, my uncle's correspondence underwent an exhaustive process of pruning and digestion before it reached him. Then the two little rooms in which my uncle talked; my magic uncle who had got the investing public-to whom all things were possible. As one came in we would find him squatting with his cigar up and an expression of dubious beatitude upon his face, while some one urged him to grow still richer by this or that.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901319"><said direct=True>"That'</said><said direct=False>ju, George?" he used to say. "Come in. Here's a thing. Tell him-Mister-over again. Have a drink, George? No! Wise man! Liss'n."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901320"><said direct=False>I was always ready to listen. All sorts of financial marvels came out of the Hardingham, more particularly during my uncle's last great flurry, but they were nothing to the projects that passed in. It was the little brown and gold room he sat in usually. He had had it redecorated by Bordingly and half a dozen Sussex pictures by Webster hung about it. Latterly he wore a velveteen jacket of a golden-brown colour in this apartment that I think over-emphasised its esthetic intention, and he also added some gross Chinese bronzes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901321"><said direct=False>He was, on the whole, a very happy man throughout all that wildly enterprising time. He made and, as I shall tell in its place, spent great sums of money. He was constantly in violent motion, constantly stimulated mentally and physically and rarely tired. About him was an atmosphere of immense deference much of his waking life was triumphal and all his dreams. I doubt if he had any dissatisfaction with himself at all until the crash bore him down. Things must have gone very rapidly with him.... I think he must have been very happy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901322"><said direct=False>As I sit here writing about all these things, jerking down notes and throwing them aside in my attempt to give some literary form to the tale of our promotions, the marvel of it all comes to me as if it came for the first time the supreme unreason of it. At the climax of his Boom, my uncle at the most sparing estimate must have possessed in substance and credit about two million pounds'-worth of property to set off against his vague colossal liabilities, and from first to last he must have had a controlling influence in the direction of nearly thirty millions.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901323"><said direct=False>This irrational muddle of a community in which we live gave him that, paid him at that rate for sitting in a room and scheming and telling it lies. For he created nothing, he invented nothing, he economised nothing. I cannot claim that a single one of the great businesses we organised added any real value to human life at all. Several like Tono-Bungay were unmitigated frauds by any honest standard, the giving of nothing coated in advertisements for money. And the things the Hardingham gave out, I repeat, were nothing to the things that came in. I think of the long procession of people who sat down before us and propounded this and that. Now it was a device for selling bread under a fancy name and so escaping the laws as to weight-this was afterwards floated as the Decorticated Health-Bread Company and bumped against the law-now it was a new scheme for still more strident advertisement, now it was a story of unsuspected deposits of minerals, now a cheap and nasty substitute for this or that common necessity, now the treachery of a too well-informed employee, anxious to become our partner. It was all put to us tentatively, persuasively. Sometimes one had a large pink blusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by his pseudo-boyish frankness, now some dyspeptically yellow whisperer, now some earnest, specially dressed youth with an eye-glass and a buttonhole, now some homely-speaking, shrewd Manchester man or some Scotchman eager to be very clear and full.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901324"><said direct=False>Many came in couples or trios, often in tow of an explanatory solicitor. Some were white and earnest, some flustered beyond measure at their opportunity. Some of them begged and prayed to be taken up. My uncle chose what he wanted and left the rest. He became very autocratic to these applicants.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901325"><said direct=False>He felt he could make them, and they felt so too. He had but to say "No!" and they faded out of existence.... He had become a sort of vortex to which wealth flowed of its own accord. His possessions increased by heaps; his shares, his leaseholds and mortgages and debentures.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901326"><said direct=False>Behind his first-line things he found it necessary at last, and sanctioned by all the precincts, to set up three general trading companies, the London and African Investment Company, the British Traders' Loan Company, and Business Organisations Limited. This was in the culminating time when I had least to do with affairs. I don't say that with any desire to exculpate myself; I admit I was a director of all three, and I will confess I was willfully incurious in that capacity. Each of these companies ended its financial year solvent by selling great holdings of shares to one or other of its sisters, and paying a dividend out of the proceeds. I sat at the table and agreed. That was our method of equilibrium at the iridescent climax of the bubble.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901327"><said direct=False>You perceive now, however, the nature of the services for which this fantastic community have him unmanageable wealth and power and real respect. It was all a monstrous payment for courageous fiction, a gratuity in return for the one reality of human life-illusion. We gave them a feeling of hope and profit; we sent a tidal wave of water and confidence into their stranded affairs. "We mint Faith, George," said my uncle one day. "That's what we do. And by Jove we got to keep minting! We been making human confidence ever since I drove the first cork of Tono-Bungay."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901328"><said direct=True>"Coining"</said><said direct=False> would have been a better word than minting! And yet, you know, in a sense he was right. Civilisation is possible only through confidence, so that we can bank our money and go unarmed about the streets. The bank reserve or a policeman keeping order in a jostling multitude of people, are only slightly less impudent bluffs than my uncle's prospectuses. They couldn't for a moment "make good" if the quarter of what they guarantee was demanded of them. The whole of this modern mercantile investing civilisation is indeed such stuff as dreams are made of. A mass of people swelters and toils, great railway systems grow, cities arise to the skies and spread wide and far, mines are opened, factories hum, foundries roar, ships plough the seas, countries are settled; about this busy striving world the rich owners go, controlling all, enjoying all, confident and creating the confidence that draws us all together into a reluctant, nearly unconscious brotherhood. I wonder and plan my engines. The flags flutter, the crowds cheer, the legislatures meet. Yet it seems to me indeed at times that all this present commercial civilisation is no more than my poor uncle's career writ large, a swelling, thinning bubble of assurances; that its arithmetic is just as unsound, its dividends as ill-advised, its ultimate aim as vague and forgotten; that it all drifts on perhaps to some tremendous parallel to his individual disaster...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901329"><said direct=False>Well, so it was we Boomed, and for four years and a half we lived a life of mingled substance and moonshine. Until our particular unsoundness overtook us we went about in the most magnificent of motor-cars upon tangible high roads, made ourselves conspicuous and stately in splendid houses, ate sumptuously and had a perpetual stream of notes and money trickling into our pockets; hundreds of thousands of men and women respected us, saluted us and gave us toil and honour; I asked, and my worksheets rose, my aeroplanes swooped out of nothingness to scare the downland pe-wits; my uncle waved his hand and Lady Grove and all its associations of chivalry and ancient peace were his; waved again, and architects were busy planning the great palace he never finished at Crest Hill and an army of folkmen gathered to do his bidding, blue marble came from Canada, and timber from New Zealand; and beneath it all, you know, there was nothing but fictitious values as evanescent as rainbow gold.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901330"><said direct=False>I pass the Hardingham ever and again and glance aside through the great archway at the fountain and the ferns, and think of those receding days when I was so near the centre of our eddy of greed and enterprise. I see again my uncle's face, white and intent, and hear him discourse, hear him make consciously Napoleonic decisions, "grip" his nettles, put his "finger on the spot," "bluff," say "snap." He became particularly addicted to the last idiom. Towards the end every conceivable act took the form of saying "snap!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901331"><said direct=False>The odd fish that came to us! And among others came Gordon-Nasmyth, that queer blend of romance and illegality who was destined to drag me into the most irrelevant adventure in my life the Mordet Island affair; and leave me, as they say, with blood upon my hands. It is remarkable how little it troubles my conscience and how much it stirs my imagination, that particular memory of the life I took. The story of Mordet Island has been told in a government report and told all wrong; there are still excellent reasons for leaving it wrong in places, but the liveliest appeals of discretion forbid my leaving it out altogether.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901332"><said direct=False>I've still the vividest memory of Gordon-Nasmyth's appearance in the inner sanctum, a lank, sunburnt person in tweeds with a yellow-brown hatchet face and one faded blue eye-the other was a closed and sunken lid-and how he told us with a stiff affectation of ease his incredible story of this great heap of quap that lay abandoned or undiscovered on the beach behind Mordet's Island among white dead mangroves and the black ooze of brackish water.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901333"><said direct=True>"What'</said><said direct=False>s quap?" said my uncle on the fourth repetition of the word.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901334"><said direct=True>"They call it quap, or quab, or quabb,"</said><said direct=False> said Gordon-Nasmyth; "but our relations weren't friendly enough to get the accent right....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901335"><said direct=True>"But there the stuff is for the taking. They don'</said><said direct=False>t know about it. Nobody knows about it. I got down to the damned place in a canoe alone. The boys wouldn't come. I pretended to be botanising." ...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901336"><said direct=False>To begin with, Gordon-Nasmyth was inclined to be dramatic.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901337"><said direct=True>"Look here,"</said><said direct=False> he said when he first came in, shutting the door rather carefully behind him as he spoke, "do you two men-yes or no-want to put up six thousand-for-a clear good chance of fifteen hundred per cent. on your money in a year?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901338"><said direct=True>"We'</said><said direct=False>re always getting chances like that," said my uncle, cocking his cigar offensively, wiping his glasses and tilting his chair back. "We stick to a safe twenty."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901339"><said direct=False>Gordon-Nasmyth's quick temper showed in a slight stiffening of his attitude.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901340"><said direct=True>"Don'</said><said direct=False>t you believe him," said I, getting up before he could reply. "You're different, and I know your books. We're very glad you've come to us. Confound it, uncle! Its Gordon-Nasmyth! Sit down. What is it? Minerals?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901341"><said direct=True>"Quap,"</said><said direct=False> said Gordon-Nasmyth, fixing his eye on me, "in heaps."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901342"><said direct=True>"In heaps,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle softly, with his glasses very oblique.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901343"><said direct=True>"You'</said><said direct=False>re only fit for the grocery," said Gordon-Nasmyth scornfully, sitting down and helping himself to one of my uncle's cigars. "I'm sorry I came. But, still, now I'm here.... And first as to quap; quap, sir, is the most radio-active stuff in the world. That's quap! It's a festering mass of earths and heavy metals, polonium, radium, ythorium, thorium, carium, and new things, too. There's a stuff called Xk-provisionally. There they are, mucked up together in a sort of rotting sand. What it is, how it got made, I don't know. It's like as if some young creator had been playing about there. There it lies in two heaps, one small, one great, and the world for miles about it is blasted and scorched and dead. You can have it for the getting. You've got to take it-that's all!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901344"><said direct=True>"That sounds all right,"</said><said direct=False> said I. "Have you samples?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901345"><said direct=False>"Well-should I? You can have anything-up to two ounces."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901346"><said direct=True>"Where is it?"</said><said direct=False>...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901347"><said direct=False>His blue eye smiled at me and scrutinised me. He smoked and was fragmentary for a time, fending off my questions; then his story began to piece itself together. He conjured up a vision of this strange forgotten kink in the world's littoral, of the long meandering channels that spread and divaricate and spend their burden of mud and silt within the thunderbelt of Atlantic surf, of the dense tangled vegetation that creeps into the shimmering water with root and sucker. He gave a sense of heat and a perpetual reek of vegetable decay, and told how at last comes a break among these things, an arena fringed with bone-white dead trees, a sight of the hard-blue sea line beyond the dazzling surf and a wide desolation of dirty shingle and mud, bleached and scarred.... A little way off among charred dead weeds stands the abandoned station,-abandoned because every man who stayed two months at that station stayed to die, eaten up mysteriously like a leper with its dismantled sheds and its decaying pier of wormrotten and oblique piles and planks, still insecurely possible.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901348"><said direct=False>And in the midst, two clumsy heaps shaped like the backs of hogs, one small, one great, sticking out under a rib of rock that cuts the space across,-quap!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901349"><said direct=True>"There it is,"</said><said direct=False> said Gordon-Nasmyth, "worth three pounds an ounce, if it's worth a penny; two great heaps of it, rotten stuff and soft, ready to shovel and wheel, and you may get it by the ton!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901350"><said direct=False>"How did it get there?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901351"><said direct=True>"God knows! ... There it is-for the taking! In a country where you mustn'</said><said direct=False>t trade. In a country where the company waits for good kind men to find it riches and then take 'em away from 'em. There you have it-derelict."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901352"><said direct=True>"Can'</said><said direct=False>t you do any sort of deal?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901353"><said direct=True>"They'</said><said direct=False>re too damned stupid. You've got to go and take it. That's all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901354"><said direct=False>"They might catch you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901355"><said direct=True>"They might, of course. But they'</said><said direct=False>re not great at catching."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901356"><said direct=False>We went into the particulars of that difficulty. "They wouldn't catch me, because I'd sink first. Give me a yacht," said Gordon-Nasmyth; "that's all I need."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901357"><said direct=True>"But if you get caught,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901358"><said direct=False>I am inclined to think Gordon-Nasmyth imagined we would give him a cheque for six thousand pounds on the strength of his talk. It was very good talk, but we didn't do that. I stipulated for samples of his stuff for analysis, and he consented-reluctantly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901359"><said direct=False>I think, on the whole, he would rather I didn't examine samples. He made a motion pocketwards, that gave us an invincible persuasion that he had a sample upon him, and that at the last instant he decided not to produce it prematurely.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901360"><said direct=False>There was evidently a curious strain of secretiveness in him. He didn't like to give us samples, and he wouldn't indicate within three hundred miles the position of this Mordet Island of his. He had it clear in his mind that he had a secret of immense value, and he had no idea at all of just how far he ought to go with business people. And so presently, to gain time for these hesitations of his, he began to talk of other things. He talked very well. He talked of the Dutch East Indies and of the Congo, of Portuguese East Africa and Paraguay, of Malays and rich Chinese merchants, Dyaks and negroes and the spread of the Mahometan world in Africa to-day. And all this time he was trying to judge if we were good enough to trust with his adventure. Our cosy inner office became a little place, and all our business cold and lifeless exploits beside his glimpses of strange minglings of men, of slayings unavenged and curious customs, of trade where no writs run, and the dark treacheries of eastern ports and uncharted channels.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901361"><said direct=False>We had neither of us gone abroad except for a few vulgar raids on Paris; our world was England, are the places of origin of half the raw material of the goods we sold had seemed to us as remote as fairyland or the forest of Arden. But Gordon-Nasmyth made it so real and intimate for us that afternoon-for me, at any rate-that it seemed like something seen and forgotten and now again remembered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901362"><said direct=False>And in the end he produced his sample, a little lump of muddy clay speckled with brownish grains, in a glass bottle wrapped about with lead and flannel-red flannel it was, I remember-a hue which is, I know, popularly supposed to double all the mystical efficacies of flannel.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901363"><said direct=True>"Don'</said><said direct=False>t carry it about on you," said Gordon-Nasmyth. "It makes a sore."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901364"><said direct=False>I took the stuff to Thorold, and Thorold had the exquisite agony of discovering two new elements in what was then a confidential analysis. He has christened them and published since, but at the time Gordon-Nasmyth wouldn't hear for a moment of our publication of any facts at all; indeed, he flew into a violent passion and abused me mercilessly even for showing the stuff to Thorold. "I thought you were going to analyse it yourself," he said with the touching persuasion of the layman that a scientific man knows and practises at the sciences.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901365"><said direct=False>I made some commercial inquiries, and there seemed even then much truth in Gordon-Nasmyth's estimate of the value of the stuff. It was before the days of Capern's discovery of the value of canadium and his use of it in the Capern filament, but the cerium and thorium alone were worth the money he extracted for the gas-mantles then in vogue. There were, however, doubts. Indeed, there were numerous doubts. What were the limits of the gas-mantle trade? How much thorium, not to speak of cerium, could they take at a maximum. Suppose that quantity was high enough to justify our shipload, came doubts in another quarter. Were the heaps up to sample? Were they as big as he said? Was Gordon-Nasmyth-imaginative? And if these values held, could we after all get the stuff? It wasn't ours. It was on forbidden ground. You see, there were doubts of every grade and class in the way of this adventure.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901366"><said direct=False>We went some way, nevertheless, in the discussion of his project, though I think we tried his patience. Then suddenly he vanished from London, and I saw no more of him for a year and a half.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901367"><said direct=False>My uncle said that was what he had expected, and when at last Gordon-Nasmyth reappeared and mentioned in an incidental way that he had been to Paraguay on private (and we guessed passionate) affairs, the business of the "quap" expedition had to be begun again at the beginning. My uncle was disposed to be altogether sceptical, but I wasn't so decided. I think I was drawn by its picturesque aspects. But we neither of us dreamt of touching it seriously until Capern's discovery.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901368"><said direct=False>Nasmyth's story had laid hold of my imagination like one small, intense picture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey business affairs. I kept it going during Gordon-Nasmyth's intermittent appearances in England. Every now and then he and I would meet and reinforce its effect. We would lunch in London, or he would cone to see my gliders at Crest Hill, and make new projects for getting at those heaps again now with me, now alone.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901369"><said direct=False>At times they became a sort of fairy-story with us, an imaginative exercise. And there came Capern's discovery of what he called the ideal filament and with it an altogether less problematical quality about the business side of quap. For the ideal filament needed five per cent. of canadium, and canadium was known to the world only as a newly separated constituent of a variety of the rare mineral rutile. But to Thorold it was better known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by me, and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap. I told my uncle, and we jumped on to the process at once. We found that Gordon-Nasmyth, still unaware of the altered value of the stuff, and still thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the rarity value of cerium, had got hold of a cousin named Pollack, made some extraordinary transaction about his life insurance policy, and was buying a brig. We put in, put down three thousand pounds, and forthwith the life insurance transaction and the Pollack side of this finance vanished into thin air, leaving Pollack, I regret to say, in the brig and in the secret-except so far as canadium and the filament went-as residuum. We discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or go on with the brig, but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous instrument for an enterprise that was after all, to put it plainly, stealing.</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG19090819"><said direct=True>"The very thing. You'</said><said direct=False>ve heard him. And saying our fortunes were made. Took me out to the Ho'burm Restaurant, George,-dinner, and we had champagne, stuff that blows up the back of your nose and makes you go SO, and he said at last he'd got things worthy of me-and we moved here next day. It's a swell house, George. Three pounds a week for the rooms. And he says the Business'll stand it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090820"><said direct=False>She looked at me doubtfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090821"><said direct=True>"Either do that or smash,"</said><said direct=False> I said profoundly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090822"><said direct=False>We discussed the question for a moment mutely with our eyes. My aunt slapped the pile of books from Mudie's.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090823"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>ve been having such a Go of reading, George. You never did!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090824"><said direct=True>"What do you think of the business?"</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090825"><said direct=True>"Well, they'</said><said direct=False>ve let him have money," she said, and thought and raised her eyebrows.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090826"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s been a time," she went on. "The flapping about! Me sitting doing nothing and him on the go like a rocket. He's done wonders. But he wants you, George-he wants you. Sometimes he's full of hope-talks of when we're going to have a carriage and be in society-makes it seem so natural and topsy-turvy, I hardly know whether my old heels aren't up here listening to him, and my old head on the floor.... Then he gets depressed. Says he wants restraint. Says he can make a splash but can't keep on. Says if you don't come in everything will smash-But you are coming in?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090827"><said direct=False>She paused and looked at me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090828"><said direct=False>"Well-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090829"><said direct=True>"You don'</said><said direct=False>t say you won't come in!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090830"><said direct=True>"But look here, aunt,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "do you understand quite?... It's a quack medicine. It's trash."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090831"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s no law against selling quack medicine that I know of," said my aunt. She thought for a minute and became unusually grave. "It's our only chance, George," she said. "If it doesn't go..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090832"><said direct=False>There came the slamming of a door, and a loud bellowing from the next apartment through the folding doors. "Here-er Shee Rulk lies Poo Tom Bo-oling."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090833"><said direct=True>"Silly old Concertina! Hark at him, George!"</said><said direct=False> She raised her voice. "Don't sing that, you old Walrus, you! Sing 'I'm afloat!'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090834"><said direct=False>One leaf of the folding doors opened and my uncle appeared.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090835"><said direct=False>"Hullo, George! Come along at last? Gossome tea-cake, Susan?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090836"><said direct=True>"Thought it over George?"</said><said direct=False> he said abruptly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090837"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090838"><said direct=False>"Coming in?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090839"><said direct=False>I paused for a last moment and nodded yes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090840"><said direct=True>"Ah!"</said><said direct=False> he cried. "Why couldn't you say that a week ago?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090841"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>ve had false ideas about the world," I said. "Oh! they don't matter now! Yes, I'll come, I'll take my chance with you, I won't hesitate again."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090842"><said direct=False>And I didn't. I stuck to that resolution for seven long years.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090843"><said direct=False>So I made my peace with my uncle, and we set out upon this bright enterprise of selling slightly injurious rubbish at one-and-three-halfpence and two-and-nine a bottle, including the Government stamp. We made Tono-Bungay hum! It brought us wealth, influence, respect, the confidence of endless people. All that my uncle promised me proved truth and understatement; Tono-Bungay carried me to freedoms and powers that no life of scientific research, no passionate service of humanity could ever have given me....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090844"><said direct=False>It was my uncle's genius that did it. No doubt he needed me,-I was, I will admit, his indispensable right hand; but his was the brain to conceive. He wrote every advertisement; some of them even he sketched. You must remember that his were the days before the Time took to enterprise and the vociferous hawking of that antiquated Encyclopedia. That alluring, button-holing, let-me -just-tell-you-quite-soberly-something-you-ought-to-know style of newspaper advertisement, with every now and then a convulsive jump of some attractive phrase into capitals, was then almost a novelty. "Many people who are MODERATELY well think they are QUITE well," was one of his early efforts. The jerks in capitals were, "DO NOT NEED DRUGS OR MEDICINE," and "SIMPLY A PROPER REGIMEN TO GET YOU IN TONE." One was warned against the chemist or druggist who pushed "much-advertised nostrums" on one's attention. That trash did more harm than good. The thing needed was regimen-and Tono-Bungay!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090845"><said direct=False>Very early, too, was that bright little quarter column, at least it was usually a quarter column in the evening papers: "HILARITY-Tono-Bungay. Like Mountain Air in the Veins." The penetrating trio of questions: "Are you bored with your Business? Are you bored with your Dinner. Are you bored with your Wife?"-that, too, was in our Gower Street days. Both these we had in our first campaign when we worked London south central, and west; and then, too, we had our first poster-the HEALTH, BEAUTY, AND STRENGTH one. That was his design; I happen still to have got by me the first sketch he made for it. I have reproduced it here with one or two others to enable the reader to understand the mental quality that initiated these familiar ornaments of London.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090846"><said direct=False>(The second one is about eighteen months later, the germ of the well-known "Fog" poster; the third was designed for an influenza epidemic, but never issued.)</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090847"><said direct=False>These things were only incidental in my department.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090848"><said direct=False>I had to polish them up for the artist and arrange the business of printing and distribution, and after my uncle had had a violent and needless quarrel with the advertising manager of the Daily Regulator about the amount of display given to one of his happy thoughts, I also took up the negotiations of advertisements for the press.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090849"><said direct=False>We discussed and worked out distribution together first in the drawing-room floor in Gower Street with my aunt sometimes helping very shrewdly, and then, with a steadily improving type of cigar and older and older whisky, in his smuggery at their first house, the one in Beckenham. Often we worked far into the night sometimes until dawn.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090850"><said direct=False>We really worked infernally hard, and, I recall, we worked with a very decided enthusiasm, not simply on my uncle's part but mine, It was a game, an absurd but absurdly interesting game, and the points were scored in cases of bottles. People think a happy notion is enough to make a man rich, that fortunes can be made without toil. It's a dream, as every millionaire (except one or two lucky gamblers) can testify; I doubt if J.D. Rockefeller in the early days of Standard Oil, worked harder than we did. We worked far into the night-and we also worked all day. We made a rule to be always dropping in at the factory unannounced to keep things right-for at first we could afford no properly responsible underlings-and we traveled London, pretending to be our own representatives and making all sorts of special arrangements.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090851"><said direct=False>But none of this was my special work, and as soon as we could get other men in, I dropped the traveling, though my uncle found it particularly interesting and kept it up for years. "Does me good, George, to see the chaps behind their counters like I was once," he explained. My special and distinctive duty was to give Tono-Bungay substance and an outward and visible bottle, to translate my uncle's great imaginings into the creation of case after case of labelled bottles of nonsense, and the punctual discharge of them by railway, road and steamer towards their ultimate goal in the Great Stomach of the People. By all modern standards the business was, as my uncle would say, "absolutely bona fide." We sold our stuff and got the money, and spent the money honestly in lies and clamour to sell more stuff. Section by section we spread it over the whole of the British Isles; first working the middle-class London suburbs, then the outer suburbs, then the home counties, then going (with new bills and a more pious style of "ad") into Wales, a great field always for a new patent-medicine, and then into Lancashire.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090852"><said direct=False>My uncle had in his inner office a big map of England, and as we took up fresh sections of the local press and our consignments invaded new areas, flags for advertisements and pink underlines for orders showed our progress.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090853"><said direct=True>"The romance of modern commerce, George!"</said><said direct=False> my uncle would say, rubbing his hands together and drawing in air through his teeth. "The romance of modern commerce, eh? Conquest. Province by province. Like sogers."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090854"><said direct=False>We subjugated England and Wales; we rolled over the Cheviots with a special adaptation containing eleven per cent. of absolute alcohol; "Tono-Bungay: Thistle Brand." We also had the Fog poster adapted to a kilted Briton in a misty Highland scene.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090855"><said direct=False>Under the shadow of our great leading line we were presently taking subsidiary specialties into action; "Tono-Bungay Hair Stimulant" was our first supplement. Then came "Concentrated Tono-Bungay" for the eyes. That didn't go, but we had a considerable success with the Hair Stimulant. We broached the subject, I remember, in a little catechism beginning: "Why does the hair fall out? Because the follicles are fagged. What are the follicles?..." So it went on to the climax that the Hair Stimulant contained all "The essential principles of that most reviving tonic, Tono-Bungay, together with an emollient and nutritious oil derived from crude Neat's Foot Oil by a process of refinement, separation and deodorization.... It will be manifest to any one of scientific attainments that in Neat's Foot Oil derived from the hoofs and horns of beasts, we must necessarily have a natural skin and hair lubricant."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090856"><said direct=False>And we also did admirable things with our next subsidiaries, "Tono-Bungay Lozenges," and "Tono-Bungay Chocolate." These we urged upon the public for their extraordinary nutritive and recuperative value in cases of fatigue and strain. We gave them posters and illustrated advertisements showing climbers hanging from marvelously vertical cliffs, cyclist champions upon the track, mounted messengers engaged in Aix-to-Ghent rides, soldiers lying out in action under a hot sun. "You can GO for twenty-four hours," we declared, "on Tono-Bungay Chocolate." We didn't say whether you could return on the same commodity. We also showed a dreadfully barristerish barrister, wig, side-whiskers, teeth, a horribly life-like portrait of all existing barristers, talking at a table, and beneath, this legend: "A Four Hours' Speech on Tono-Bungay Lozenges, and as fresh as when he began." Then brought in regiments of school-teachers, revivalist ministers, politicians and the like. I really do believe there was an element of "kick" in the strychnine in these lozenges, especially in those made according to our earlier formula. For we altered all our formulae-invariably weakening them enormously as sales got ahead.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090857"><said direct=False>In a little while-so it seems to me now-we were employing travelers and opening up Great Britain at the rate of a hundred square miles a day. All the organisation throughout was sketched in a crude, entangled, half-inspired fashion by my uncle, and all of it had to be worked out into a practicable scheme of quantities and expenditure by me. We had a lot of trouble finding our travelers; in the end at least half of them were Irish-Americans, a wonderful breed for selling medicine. We had still more trouble over our factory manager, because of the secrets of the inner room, and in the end we got a very capable woman, Mrs. Hampton Diggs, who had formerly managed a large millinery workroom, whom we could trust to keep everything in good working order without finding out anything that wasn't put exactly under her loyal and energetic nose. She conceived a high opinion of Tono-Bungay and took it in all forms and large quantities so long as I knew her. It didn't seem to do her any harm. And she kept the girls going quite wonderfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090858"><said direct=False>My uncle's last addition to the Tono-Bungay group was the Tono-Bungay Mouthwash. The reader has probably read a hundred times that inspiring inquiry of his, "You are Young Yet, but are you Sure Nothing has Aged your Gums?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090859"><said direct=False>And after that we took over the agency for three or four good American lines that worked in with our own, and could be handled with it; Texan Embrocation, and "23-to clear the system" were the chief....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090860"><said direct=False>I set down these bare facts. To me they are all linked with the figure of my uncle. In some of the old seventeenth and early eighteenth century prayerbooks at Bladesover there used to be illustrations with long scrolls coming out of the mouths of the wood-cut figures. I wish I could write all this last chapter on a scroll coming out of the head of my uncle, show it all the time as unfolding and pouring out from a short, fattening, small-legged man with stiff cropped hair, disobedient glasses on a perky little nose, and a round stare behind them. I wish I could show you him breathing hard and a little through his nose as his pen scrabbled out some absurd inspiration for a poster or a picture page, and make you hear his voice, charged with solemn import like the voice of a squeaky prophet, saying, "George! list'n! I got an ideer. I got a notion! George!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090861"><said direct=False>I should put myself into the same picture. Best setting for us, I think, would be the Beckenham snuggery, because there we worked hardest. It would be the lamplit room of the early nineties, and the clock upon the mantel would indicate midnight or later. We would be sitting on either side of the fire, I with a pipe, my uncle with a cigar or cigarette. There would be glasses standing inside the brass fender. Our expressions would be very grave. My uncle used to sit right back in his armchair; his toes always turned in when he was sitting down and his legs had a way of looking curved, as though they hadn't bones or joints but were stuffed with sawdust.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090862"><said direct=True>"George, whad'</said><said direct=False>yer think of T.B. for sea-sickness?" he would say.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090863"><said direct=False>"No good that I can imagine."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090864"><said direct=False>"Oom! No harm TRYING, George. We can but try."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090865"><said direct=False>I would suck my pipe. "Hard to get at. Unless we sold our stuff specially at the docks. Might do a special at Cook's office, or in the Continental Bradshaw."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090866"><said direct=True>"It '</said><said direct=False>ud give 'em confidence, George."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090867"><said direct=False>He would Zzzz, with his glasses reflecting the red of the glowing coals.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090868"><said direct=True>"No good hiding our light under a Bushel,"</said><said direct=False> he would remark.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090869"><said direct=False>I never really determined whether my uncle regarded Tono-Bungay as a fraud, or whether he didn't come to believe in it in a kind of way by the mere reiteration of his own assertions. I think that his average attitude was one of kindly, almost parental, toleration. I remember saying on one occasion, "But you don't suppose this stuff ever did a human being the slightest good all?" and how his face assumed a look of protest, as of one reproving harshness and dogmatism.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090870"><said direct=True>"You'</said><said direct=False>ve a hard nature, George," he said. "You're too ready to run things down. How can one TELL? How can one venture to TELL!..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090871"><said direct=False>I suppose any creative and developing game would have interested me in those years. At any rate, I know I put as much zeal into this Tono-Bungay as any young lieutenant could have done who suddenly found himself in command of a ship. It was extraordinarily interesting to me to figure out the advantage accruing from this shortening of the process or that, and to weigh it against the capital cost of the alteration. I made a sort of machine for sticking on the labels, that I patented; to this day there is a little trickle of royalties to me from that. I also contrived to have our mixture made concentrated, got the bottles, which all came sliding down a guarded slant-way, nearly filled with distilled water at one tap, and dripped our magic ingredients in at the next. This was an immense economy of space for the inner sanctum. For the bottling we needed special taps, and these, too, I invented and patented.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090872"><said direct=False>We had a sort of endless band of bottles sliding along an inclined glass trough made slippery with running water. At one end a girl held them up to the light, put aside any that were imperfect and placed the others in the trough; the filling was automatic; at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet. Each tank, the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled water, had a level indicator, and inside I had a float arrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low. Another girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand them to the three packers, who slipped them into their outer papers and put them, with a pad of corrugated paper between each pair, into a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into position in our standard packing-case. It sounds wild, I know, but I believe I was the first man in the city of London to pack patent medicines through the side of the packing-case, to discover there was a better way in than by the lid. Our cases packed themselves, practically; had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs, who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side. Our girls, moreover, packed with corrugated paper and matchbook-wood box partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to pack through the top of the box with straw, many breakages and much waste and confusion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090873"><said direct=False>As I look back at them now, those energetic years seem all compacted to a year or so; from the days of our first hazardous beginning in Farringdon Street with barely a thousand pounds' worth of stuff or credit all told-and that got by something perilously like snatching-to the days when my uncle went to the public on behalf of himself and me (one-tenth share) and our silent partners, the drug wholesalers and the printing people and the owner of that group of magazines and newspapers, to ask with honest confidence for L150,000. Those silent partners were remarkably sorry, I know, that they had not taken larger shares and given us longer credit when the subscriptions came pouring in. My uncle had a clear half to play with (including the one-tenth understood to be mine).</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090874"><said direct=False>L150,000-think of it!-for the goodwill in a string of lies and a trade in bottles of mitigated water! Do you realise the madness of the world that sanctions such a thing? Perhaps you don't. At times use and wont certainly blinded me. If it had not been for Ewart, I don't think I should have had an inkling of the wonderfulness of this development of my fortunes; I should have grown accustomed to it, fallen in with all its delusions as completely as my uncle presently did. He was immensely proud of the flotation. "They've never been given such value," he said, "for a dozen years." But Ewart, with his gesticulating hairy hands and bony wrists, his single-handed chorus to all this as it played itself over again in my memory, and he kept my fundamental absurdity illuminated for me during all this astonishing time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090875"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s just on all fours with the rest of things," he remarked; "only more so. You needn't think you're anything out of the way."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090876"><said direct=False>I remember one disquisition very distinctly. It was just after Ewart had been to Paris on a mysterious expedition to "rough in" some work for a rising American sculptor. This young man had a commission for an allegorical figure of Truth (draped, of course) for his State Capitol, and he needed help. Ewart had returned with his hair cut en brosse and with his costume completely translated into French. He wore, I remember, a bicycling suit of purplish-brown, baggy beyond ageing-the only creditable thing about it was that it had evidently not been made for him-a voluminous black tie, a decadent soft felt hat and several French expletives of a sinister description. "Silly clothes, aren't they?" he said at the sight of my startled eye. "I don't know why I got'm. They seemed all right over there."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090877"><said direct=False>He had come down to our Raggett Street place to discuss a benevolent project of mine for a poster by him, and he scattered remarkable discourse over the heads (I hope it was over the heads) of our bottlers.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090878"><said direct=True>"What I like about it all, Ponderevo, is its poetry.... That'</said><said direct=False>s where we get the pull of the animals. No animal would ever run a factory like this. Think!... One remembers the Beaver, of course. He might very possibly bottle things, but would he stick a label round 'em and sell 'em? The Beaver is a dreamy fool, I'll admit, him and his dams, but after all there's a sort of protection about 'em, a kind of muddy practicality! They prevent things getting at him. And it's not your poetry only. It's the poetry of the customer too. Poet answering to poet-soul to soul. Health, Strength and Beauty-in a bottle-the magic philtre! Like a fairy tale....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090879"><said direct=True>"Think of the people to whom your bottles of footle go! (I'</said><said direct=False>m calling it footle, Ponderevo, out of praise," he said in parenthesis.)</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090880"><said direct=True>"Think of the little clerks and jaded women and overworked people. People overstrained with wanting to do, people overstrained with wanting to be.... People, in fact, overstrained.... The real trouble of life, Ponderevo, isn'</said><said direct=False>t that we exist-that's a vulgar error; the real trouble is that we DON'T really exist and we want to. That's what this-in the highest sense-just stands for! The hunger to be-for once-really alive-to the finger tips!...</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090881"><said direct=True>"Nobody wants to do and be the things people are-nobody. YOU don'</said><said direct=False>t want to preside over this-this bottling; I don't want to wear these beastly clothes and be led about by you; nobody wants to keep on sticking labels on silly bottles at so many farthings a gross. That isn't existing! That's-sus-substratum. None of us want to be what we are, or to do what we do. Except as a sort of basis. What do we want? You know. I know. Nobody confesses. What we all want to be is something perpetually young and beautiful-young Joves-young Joves, Ponderevo"-his voice became loud, harsh and declamatory-"pursuing coy half-willing nymphs through everlasting forests."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090882"><said direct=False>There was a just-perceptible listening hang in the work about us.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090883"><said direct=True>"Come downstairs,"</said><said direct=False> I interrupted, "we can talk better there."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090884"><said direct=True>"I can talk better here,"</said><said direct=False> he answered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090885"><said direct=False>He was just going on, but fortunately the implacable face of Mrs. Hampton Diggs appeared down the aisle of bottling machines.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090886"><said direct=True>"All right,"</said><said direct=False> he said, "I'll come."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090887"><said direct=False>In the little sanctum below, my uncle was taking a digestive pause after his lunch and by no means alert. His presence sent Ewart back to the theme of modern commerce, over the excellent cigar my uncle gave him. He behaved with the elaborate deference due to a business magnate from an unknown man.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090888"><said direct=True>"What I was pointing out to your nephew, sir,"</said><said direct=False> said Ewart, putting both elbows on the table, "was the poetry of commerce. He doesn't, you know, seem to see it at all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090889"><said direct=False>My uncle nodded brightly. "Whad I tell 'im," he said round his cigar.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090890"><said direct=True>"We are artists. You and I, sir, can talk, if you will permit me, as one artist to another. It'</said><said direct=False>s advertisement has-done it. Advertisement has revolutionised trade and industry; it is going to revolutionise the world. The old merchant used to tote about commodities; the new one creates values. Doesn't need to tote. He takes something that isn't worth anything-or something that isn't particularly worth anything-and he makes it worth something. He takes mustard that is just like anybody else's mustard, and he goes about saying, shouting, singing, chalking on walls, writing inside people's books, putting it everywhere, 'Smith's Mustard is the Best.' And behold it is the best!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090891"><said direct=True>"True,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, chubbily and with a dreamy sense of mysticism; "true!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090892"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s just like an artist; he takes a lump of white marble on the verge of a lime-kiln, he chips it about, he makes-he makes a monument to himself-and others-a monument the world will not willingly let die. Talking of mustard, sir, I was at Clapham Junction the other day, and all the banks are overgrown with horse radish that's got loose from a garden somewhere. You know what horseradish is-grows like wildfire-spreads-spreads. I stood at the end of the platform looking at the stuff and thinking about it. 'Like fame,' I thought, 'rank and wild where it isn't wanted. Why don't the really good things in life grow like horseradish?' I thought. My mind went off in a peculiar way it does from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tin-I bought some the other day for a ham I had. It came into my head that it would be ripping good business to use horseradish to adulterate mustard. I had a sort of idea that I could plunge into business on that, get rich and come back to my own proper monumental art again. And then I said, 'But why adulterate? I don't like the idea of adulteration.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090893"><said direct=True>"Shabby,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, nodding his head. "Bound to get found out!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090894"><said direct=False>"And totally unnecessary, too! Why not do up a mixture-three-quarters pounded horseradish and a quarter mustard-give it a fancy name-and sell it at twice the mustard price. See? I very nearly started the business straight away, only something happened. My train came along."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090895"><said direct=True>"Jolly good ideer,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle. He looked at me. "That really is an ideer, George," he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090896"><said direct=True>"Take shavin'</said><said direct=False>s, again! You know that poem of Longfellow's, sir, that sounds exactly like the first declension. What is it?-'Marr's a maker, men say!'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090897"><said direct=False>My uncle nodded and gurgled some quotation that died away.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090898"><said direct=True>"Jolly good poem, George,"</said><said direct=False> he said in an aside to me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090899"><said direct=True>"Well, it'</said><said direct=False>s about a carpenter and a poetic Victorian child, you know, and some shavin's. The child made no end out of the shavin's. So might you. Powder 'em. They might be anything. Soak 'em in jipper,-Xylo-tobacco! Powder'em and get a little tar and turpentinous smell in,-wood-packing for hot baths-a Certain Cure for the scourge of Influenza! There's all these patent grain foods,-what Americans call cereals. I believe I'm right, sir, in saying they're sawdust."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090900"><said direct=True>"No!"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, removing his cigar; "as far as I can find out it's really grain,-spoilt grain.... I've been going into that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090901"><said direct=True>"Well, there you are!"</said><said direct=False> said Ewart. "Say it's spoilt grain. It carried out my case just as well. Your modern commerce is no more buying and selling than sculpture. It's mercy-it's salvation. It's rescue work! It takes all sorts of fallen commodities by the hand and raises them. Cana isn't in it. You turn water-into Tono-Bungay."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090902"><said direct=True>"Tono-Bungay'</said><said direct=False>s all right," said my uncle, suddenly grave. "We aren't talking of Tono-Bungay."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090903"><said direct=True>"Your nephew, sir, is hard; he wants everything to go to a sort of predestinated end; he'</said><said direct=False>s a Calvinist of Commerce. Offer him a dustbin full of stuff; he calls it refuse-passes by on the other side. Now YOU, sir you'd make cinders respect themselves."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090904"><said direct=False>My uncle regarded him dubiously for a moment. But there was a touch of appreciation in his eye.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090905"><said direct=True>"Might make '</said><said direct=False>em into a sort of sanitary brick," he reflected over his cigar end.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090906"><said direct=True>"Or a friable biscuit. Why NOT? You might advertise: '</said><said direct=False>Why are Birds so Bright? Because they digest their food perfectly! Why do they digest their food so perfectly? Because they have a gizzard! Why hasn't man a gizzard? Because he can buy Ponderevo's Asphalt Triturating, Friable Biscuit-Which is Better.'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090907"><said direct=False>He delivered the last words in a shout, with his hairy hand flourished in the air....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090908"><said direct=True>"Damn clever fellow,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, after he had one. "I know a man when I see one. He'd do. But drunk, I should say. But that only makes some chap brighter. If he WANTS to do that poster, he can. Zzzz. That ideer of his about the horseradish. There's something in that, George. I'm going to think over that...."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090909"><said direct=False>I may say at once that my poster project came to nothing in the end, though Ewart devoted an interesting week to the matter. He let his unfortunate disposition to irony run away with him. He produced a picture of two beavers with a subtle likeness, he said, to myself and my uncle-the likeness to my uncle certainly wasn't half bad-and they were bottling rows and rows of Tono-Bungay, with the legend "Modern commerce." It certainly wouldn't have sold a case, though he urged it on me one cheerful evening on the ground that it would "arouse curiosity." In addition he produced a quite shocking study of my uncle, excessively and needlessly nude, but, so far as I was able to judge, an admirable likeness, engaged in feats of strength of a Gargantuan type before an audience of deboshed and shattered ladies. The legend, "Health, Beauty, Strength," below, gave a needed point to his parody. This he hung up in the studio over the oil shop, with a flap of brown paper; by way of a curtain over it to accentuate its libellous offence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090910"><said direct=False>As I look back on those days in which we built up the great Tono-Bungay property out of human hope and credit for bottles and rent and printing, I see my life as it were arranged in two parallel columns of unequal width, a wider, more diffused, eventful and various one which continually broadens out, the business side of my life, and a narrow, darker and darkling one shot ever and again with a gleam of happiness, my home-life with Marion. For, of course, I married Marion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090911"><said direct=False>I didn't, as a matter of fact, marry her until a year after Tono-Bungay was thoroughly afloat, and then only after conflicts and discussions of a quite strenuous sort. By that time I was twenty-four. It seems the next thing to childhood now. We were both in certain directions unusually ignorant and simple; we were temperamentally antagonistic, and we hadn't-I don't think we were capable of-an idea in common. She was young and extraordinarily conventional-she seemed never to have an idea of her own but always the idea of her class-and I was young and sceptical, enterprising and passionate; the two links that held us together were the intense appeal her physical beauty had for me, and her appreciation of her importance in my thoughts. There can be no doubt of my passion for her. In her I had discovered woman desired. The nights I have lain awake on account of her, writhing, biting my wrists in a fever of longing! ...</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090912"><said direct=False>I have told how I got myself a silk hat and black coat to please her on Sunday-to the derision of some of my fellow-students who charged to meet me, and how we became engaged. But that was only the beginning of our difference. To her that meant the beginning of a not unpleasant little secrecy, an occasional use of verbal endearments, perhaps even kisses. It was something to go on indefinitely, interfering in no way with her gossiping spells of work at Smithie's. To me it was a pledge to come together into the utmost intimacy of soul and body so soon as we could contrive it....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090913"><said direct=False>I don't know if it will strike the reader that I am setting out to discuss the queer, unwise love relationship and my bungle of a marriage with excessive solemnity. But to me it seems to reach out to vastly wider issues than our little personal affair. I've thought over my life. In these last few years I've tried to get at least a little wisdom out of it. And in particular I've thought over this part of my life. I'm enormously impressed by the ignorant, unguided way in which we two entangled ourselves with each other. It seems to me the queerest thing in all this network of misunderstandings and misstatements and faulty and ramshackle conventions which makes up our social order as the individual meets it, that we should have come together so accidentally and so blindly. Because we were no more than samples of the common fate. Love is not only the cardinal fact in the individual life, but the most important concern of the community; after all, the way in which the young people of this generation pair off determines the fate of the nation; all the other affairs of the State are subsidiary to that. And we leave it to flushed and blundering youth to stumble on its own significance, with nothing to guide in but shocked looks and sentimental twaddle and base whisperings and cant-smeared examples.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090914"><said direct=False>I have tried to indicate something of my own sexual development in the preceding chapter. Nobody was ever frank and decent with me in this relation; nobody, no book, ever came and said to me thus and thus is the world made, and so and so is necessary. Everything came obscurely, indefinitely, perplexingly; and all I knew of law or convention in the matter had the form of threatenings and prohibitions. Except through the furtive, shameful talk of my coevals at Goudhurst and Wimblehurst, I was not even warned against quite horrible dangers. My ideas were made partly of instinct, partly of a romantic imagination, partly woven out of a medley of scraps of suggestion that came to me haphazard. I had read widely and confusedly "Vathek," Shelley, Tom Paine, Plutarch, Carlyle, Haeckel, William Morris, the Bible, the Freethinker, the Clarion, "The Woman Who Did,"-I mention the ingredients that come first to mind. All sorts of ideas were jumbled up in me and never a lucid explanation. But it was evident to me that the world regarded Shelley, for example, as a very heroic as well as beautiful person; and that to defy convention and succumb magnificently to passion was the proper thing to do to gain the respect and affection of all decent people.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090915"><said direct=False>And the make-up of Marion's mind in the matter was an equally irrational affair. Her training had been one, not simply of silences, but suppressions. An enormous force of suggestion had so shaped her that the intense natural fastidiousness of girlhood had developed into an absolute perversion of instinct. For all that is cardinal in this essential business of life she had one inseparable epithet-"horrid." Without any such training she would have been a shy lover, but now she was an impossible one. For the rest she had derived, I suppose, partly from the sort of fiction she got from the Public Library, and partly from the workroom talk at Smithie's. So far as the former origin went, she had an idea of love as a state of worship and service on the part of the man and of condescension on the part of the woman. There was nothing "horrid" about it in any fiction she had read. The man gave presents, did services, sought to be in every way delightful. The woman "went out" with him, smiled at him, was kissed by him in decorous secrecy, and if he chanced to offend, denied her countenance and presence. Usually she did something "for his good" to him, made him go to church, made him give up smoking or gambling, smartened him up. Quite at the end of the story came a marriage, and after that the interest ceased.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090916"><said direct=False>That was the tenor of Marion's fiction; but I think the work-table conversation at Smithie's did something to modify that. At Smithie's it was recognised, I think, that a "fellow" was a possession to be desired; that it was better to be engaged to a fellow than not; that fellows had to be kept-they might be mislaid, they might even be stolen. There was a case of stealing at Smithie's, and many tears.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090917"><said direct=False>Smithie I met before we were married, and afterwards she became a frequent visitor to our house at Ealing. She was a thin, bright-eyed, hawk-nosed girl of thirtyodd, with prominent teeth, a high-pitched, eager voice and a disposition to be urgently smart in her dress. Her hats were startling and various, but invariably disconcerting, and she talked in a rapid, nervous flow that was hilarious rather than witty, and broken by little screams of "Oh, my dear!" and "you never did!" She was the first woman I ever met who used scent. Poor old Smithie! What a harmless, kindly soul she really was, and how heartily I detested her! Out of the profits on the Persian robes she supported a sister's family of three children, she "helped" a worthless brother, and overflowed in help even to her workgirls, but that didn't weigh with me in those youthfully-narrow times. It was one of the intense minor irritations of my married life that Smithie's whirlwind chatter seemed to me to have far more influence with Marion than anything I had to say. Before all things I coveted her grip upon Marion's inaccessible mind.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090918"><said direct=False>In the workroom at Smithie's, I gathered, they always spoke of me demurely as "A Certain Person." I was rumoured to be dreadfully "clever," and there were doubts-not altogether without justification-of the sweetness of my temper.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090919"><said direct=False>Well, these general explanations will enable the reader to understand the distressful times we two had together when presently I began to feel on a footing with Marion and to fumble conversationally for the mind and the wonderful passion I felt, obstinately and stupidity, must be in her. I think she thought me the maddest of sane men; "clever," in fact, which at Smithie's was, I suppose, the next thing to insanity, a word intimating incomprehensible and incalculable motives.... She could be shocked at anything, she misunderstood everything, and her weapon was a sulky silence that knitted her brows, spoilt her mouth and robbed her face of beauty. "Well, if we can't agree, I don't see why you should go on talking," she used to say. That would always enrage me beyond measure. Or, "I'm afraid I'm not clever enough to understand that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090920"><said direct=False>Silly little people! I see it all now, but then I was no older than she and I couldn't see anything but that Marion, for some inexplicable reason, wouldn't come alive.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090921"><said direct=False>We would contrive semi-surreptitious walks on Sunday, and part speechless with the anger of indefinable offences. Poor Marion! The things I tried to put before her, my fermenting ideas about theology, about Socialism, about aesthetics-the very words appalled her, gave her the faint chill of approaching impropriety, the terror of a very present intellectual impossibility. Then by an enormous effort I would suppress myself for a time and continue a talk that made her happy, about Smithie's brother, about the new girl who had come to the workroom, about the house we would presently live in. But there we differed a little. I wanted to be accessible to St. Paul's or Cannon Street Station, and she had set her mind quite resolutely upon Eating.... It wasn't by any means quarreling all the time, you understand. She liked me to play the lover "nicely"; she liked the effect of going about-we had lunches, we went to Earl's Court, to Kew, to theatres and concerts, but not often to concerts, because, though Marion "liked" music, she didn't like "too much of it," to picture shows-and there was a nonsensical sort of babytalk I picked up-I forget where now-that became a mighty peacemaker.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090922"><said direct=False>Her worst offence for me was an occasional excursion into the Smithie style of dressing, debased West Kensington. For she had no sense at all of her own beauty. She had no comprehension whatever of beauty of the body, and she could slash her beautiful lines to rags with hat-brims and trimmings. Thank Heaven! a natural refinement, a natural timidity, and her extremely slender purse kept her from the real Smithie efflorescence! Poor, simple, beautiful, kindly limited Marion! Now that I am forty-five, I can look back at her with all my old admiration and none of my old bitterness with a new affection and not a scrap of passion, and take her part against the equally stupid, drivingly-energetic, sensuous, intellectual sprawl I used to be. I was a young beast for her to have married-a hound beast. With her it was my business to understand and control-and I exacted fellowship, passion....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090923"><said direct=False>We became engaged, as I have told; we broke it off and joined again. We went through a succession of such phases. We had no sort of idea what was wrong with us. Presently we were formally engaged. I had a wonderful interview with her father, in which he was stupendously grave and H-less, wanted to know about my origins and was tolerant (exasperatingly tolerant) because my mother was a servant, and afterwards her mother took to kissing me, and I bought a ring. But the speechless aunt, I gathered, didn't approve-having doubts of my religiosity. Whenever we were estranged we could keep apart for days; and to begin with, every such separation was a relief. And then I would want her; a restless longing would come upon me. I would think of the flow of her arms, of the soft, gracious bend of her body. I would lie awake or dream of a transfigured Marion of light and fire. It was indeed Dame Nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid, inexorable way; but I thought it was the need of Marion that troubled me. So I always went back to Marion at last and made it up and more or less conceded or ignored whatever thing had parted us, and more and more I urged her to marry me....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090924"><said direct=False>In the long run that became a fixed idea. It entangled my will and my pride; I told myself I was not going to be beaten. I hardened to the business. I think, as a matter of fact, my real passion for Marion had waned enormously long before we were married, that she had lived it down by sheer irresponsiveness. When I felt sure of my three hundred a year she stipulated for delay, twelve months' delay, "to see how things would turn out." There were times when she seemed simply an antagonist holding out irritatingly against something I had to settle. Moreover, I began to be greatly distracted by the interest and excitement of Tono-Bungay's success, by the change and movement in things, the going to and fro. I would forget her for days together, and then desire her with an irritating intensity at last, one Saturday afternoon, after a brooding morning, I determined almost savagely that these delays must end.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090925"><said direct=False>I went off to the little home at Walham Green, and made Marion come with me to Putney Common. Marion wasn't at home when I got there and I had to fret for a time and talk to her father, who was just back from his office, he explained, and enjoying himself in his own way in the greenhouse.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090926"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>m going to ask your daughter to marry me!" I said. "I think we've been waiting long enough."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090927"><said direct=True>"I don'</said><said direct=False>t approve of long engagements either," said her father. "But Marion will have her own way about it, anyhow. Seen this new powdered fertiliser?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090928"><said direct=False>I went in to talk to Mrs. Ramboat. "She'll want time to get her things," said Mrs. Ramboat....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090929"><said direct=False>I and Marion sat down together on a little seat under some trees at the top of Putney Hill, and I came to my point abruptly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090930"><said direct=True>"Look here, Marion,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "are you going to marry me or are you not?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090931"><said direct=False>She smiled at me. "Well," she said, "we're engaged-aren't we?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090932"><said direct=True>"That can'</said><said direct=False>t go on for ever. Will you marry me next week?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090933"><said direct=False>She looked me in the face. "We can't," she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090934"><said direct=False>"You promised to marry me when I had three hundred a year."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090935"><said direct=False>She was silent for a space. "Can't we go on for a time as we are? We COULD marry on three hundred a year. But it means a very little house. There's Smithie's brother. They manage on two hundred and fifty, but that's very little. She says they have a semi-detached house almost on the road, and hardly a bit of garden. And the wall to next-door is so thin they hear everything. When her baby cries-they rap. And people stand against the railings and talk.... Can't we wait? You're doing so well."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090936"><said direct=False>An extraordinary bitterness possessed me at this invasion of the stupendous beautiful business of love by sordid necessity. I answered her with immense restraint.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090937"><said direct=True>"If,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "we could have a double-fronted, detached house-at Ealing, say-with a square patch of lawn in front and a garden behind-and-and a tiled bathroom."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090938"><said direct=False>"That would be sixty pounds a year at least."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090939"><said direct=True>"Which means five hundred a year.... Yes, well, you see, I told my uncle I wanted that, and I'</said><said direct=False>ve got it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090940"><said direct=False>"Got what?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090941"><said direct=False>"Five hundred pounds a year."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090942"><said direct=False>"Five hundred pounds!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090943"><said direct=False>I burst into laughter that had more than a taste of bitterness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090944"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "really! and NOW what do you think?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090945"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> she said, a little flushed; "but be sensible! Do you really mean you've got a Rise, all at once, of two hundred a year?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090946"><said direct=False>"To marry on-yes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090947"><said direct=False>She scrutinised me a moment. "You've done this as a surprise!" she said, and laughed at my laughter. She had become radiant, and that made me radiant, too.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090948"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "yes," and laughed no longer bitterly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090949"><said direct=False>She clasped her hands and looked me in the eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090950"><said direct=False>She was so pleased that I forgot absolutely my disgust of a moment before. I forgot that she had raised her price two hundred pounds a year and that I had bought her at that.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090951"><said direct=True>"Come!"</said><said direct=False> I said, standing up; "let's go towards the sunset, dear, and talk about it all. Do you know-this is a most beautiful world, an amazingly beautiful world, and when the sunset falls upon you it makes you into shining gold. No, not gold-into golden glass.... Into something better that either glass or gold."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090952"><said direct=False>And for all that evening I wooed her and kept her glad. She made me repeat my assurances over again and still doubted a little.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090953"><said direct=False>We furnished that double-fronted house from attic-it ran to an attic-to cellar, and created a garden.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090954"><said direct=True>"Do you know Pampas Grass?"</said><said direct=False> said Marion. "I love Pampas Grass... if there is room."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090955"><said direct=True>"You shall have Pampas Grass,"</said><said direct=False> I declared. And there were moments as we went in imagination about that house together, when my whole being cried out to take her in my arms-now. But I refrained. On that aspect of life I touched very lightly in that talk, very lightly because I had had my lessons. She promised to marry me within two months' time. Shyly, reluctantly, she named a day, and next afternoon, in heat and wrath, we "broke it off" again for the last time. We split upon procedure. I refused flatly to have a normal wedding with wedding cake, in white favours, carriages and the rest of it. It dawned upon me suddenly in conversation with her and her mother, that this was implied. I blurted out my objection forthwith, and this time it wasn't any ordinary difference of opinion; it was a "row." I don't remember a quarter of the things we flung out in that dispute. I remember her mother reiterating in tones of gentle remonstrance: "But, George dear, you must have a cake-to send home." I think we all reiterated things. I seem to remember a refrain of my own: "A marriage is too sacred a thing, too private a thing, for this display. Her father came in and stood behind me against the wall, and her aunt appeared beside the sideboard and stood with arms, looking from speaker to speaker, a sternly gratified prophetess. It didn't occur to me then! How painful it was to Marion for these people to witness my rebellion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090956"><said direct=True>"But, George,"</said><said direct=False> said her father, "what sort of marriage do you want? You don't want to go to one of those there registry offices?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090957"><said direct=True>"That'</said><said direct=False>s exactly what I'd like to do. Marriage is too private a thing-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090958"><said direct=True>"I shouldn'</said><said direct=False>t feel married," said Mrs. Ramboat.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090959"><said direct=True>"Look here, Marion,"</said><said direct=False> I said; "we are going to be married at a registry office. I don't believe in all these fripperies and superstitions, and I won't submit to them. I've agreed to all sorts of things to please you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090960"><said direct=True>"What'</said><said direct=False>s he agreed to?" said her father-unheeded.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090961"><said direct=True>"I can'</said><said direct=False>t marry at a registry office," said Marion, sallow-white.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090962"><said direct=True>"Very well,"</said><said direct=False> I said. "I'll marry nowhere else."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090963"><said direct=True>"I can'</said><said direct=False>t marry at a registry office."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090964"><said direct=True>"Very well,"</said><said direct=False> I said, standing up, white and tense and it amazed me, but I was also exultant; "then we won't marry at all."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090965"><said direct=False>She leant forward over the table, staring blankly. But presently her half-averted face began to haunt me as she had sat at the table, and her arm and the long droop of her shoulder.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090966"><said direct=False>The next day I did an unexampled thing. I sent a telegram to my uncle, "Bad temper not coming to business," and set off for Highgate and Ewart. He was actually at work-on a bust of Millie, and seemed very glad for any interruption.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090967"><said direct=True>"Ewart, you old Fool,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "knock off and come for a day's gossip. I'm rotten. There's a sympathetic sort of lunacy about you. Let's go to Staines and paddle up to Windsor."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090968"><said direct=True>"Girl?"</said><said direct=False> said Ewart, putting down a chisel.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090969"><said direct=False>"Yes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090970"><said direct=False>That was all I told him of my affair.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090971"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>ve got no money," he remarked, to clear up ambiguity in my invitation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090972"><said direct=False>We got a jar of shandy-gaff, some food, and, on Ewart's suggestion, two Japanese sunshades in Staines; we demanded extra cushions at the boathouse and we spent an enormously soothing day in discourse and meditation, our boat moored in a shady place this side of Windsor. I seem to remember Ewart with a cushion forward, only his heels and sunshade and some black ends of hair showing, a voice and no more, against the shining, smoothly-streaming mirror of the trees and bushes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090973"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s not worth it," was the burthen of the voice. "You'd better get yourself a Millie, Ponderevo, and then you wouldn't feel so upset."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090974"><said direct=True>"No,"</said><said direct=False> I said decidedly, "that's not my way."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090975"><said direct=False>A thread of smoke ascended from Ewart for a while, like smoke from an altar.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090976"><said direct=True>"Everything'</said><said direct=False>s a muddle, and you think it isn't. Nobody knows where we are-because, as a matter of fact we aren't anywhere. Are women property-or are they fellow-creatures? Or a sort of proprietary goddesses? They're so obviously fellow-creatures. You believe in the goddess?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090977"><said direct=True>"No,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "that's not my idea."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090978"><said direct=False>"What is your idea?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090979"><said direct=False>"Well"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090980"><said direct=True>"H'</said><said direct=False>m," said Ewart, in my pause.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090981"><said direct=True>"My idea,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "is to meet one person who will belong to me-to whom I shall belong-body and soul. No half-gods! Wait till she comes. If she comes at all.... We must come to each other young and pure."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090982"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s no such thing as a pure person or an impure person.... Mixed to begin with."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090983"><said direct=False>This was so manifestly true that it silenced me altogether.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090984"><said direct=True>"And if you belong to her and she to you, Ponderevo-which end'</said><said direct=False>s the head?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090985"><said direct=False>I made no answer except an impatient "oh!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090986"><said direct=False>For a time we smoked in silence....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090987"><said direct=True>"Did I tell you, Ponderevo, of a wonderful discovery I'</said><said direct=False>ve made?" Ewart began presently.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090988"><said direct=True>"No,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "what is it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090989"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s no Mrs. Grundy."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090990"><said direct=False>"No?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090991"><said direct=True>"No! Practically not. I'</said><said direct=False>ve just thought all that business out. She's merely an instrument, Ponderevo. She's borne the blame. Grundy's a man. Grundy unmasked. Rather lean and out of sorts. Early middle age. With bunchy black whiskers and a worried eye. Been good so far, and it's fretting him! Moods! There's Grundy in a state of sexual panic, for example,-'For God's sake cover it up! They get together-they get together! It's too exciting! The most dreadful things are happening!' Rushing about-long arms going like a windmill. 'They must be kept apart!' Starts out for an absolute obliteration of everything absolute separations. One side of the road for men, and the other for women, and a hoarding-without posters between them. Every boy and girl to be sewed up in a sack and sealed, just the head and hands and feet out until twenty-one. Music abolished, calico garments for the lower animals! Sparrows to be suppressed-ab-so-lutely."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090992"><said direct=False>I laughed abruptly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090993"><said direct=True>"Well, that'</said><said direct=False>s Mr. Grundy in one mood-and it puts Mrs. Grundy-She's a much-maligned person, Ponderevo-a rake at heart-and it puts her in a most painful state of fluster-most painful! She's an amenable creature. When Grundy tells her things are shocking, she's shocked-pink and breathless. She goes about trying to conceal her profound sense of guilt behind a haughty expression....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090994"><said direct=True>"Grundy, meanwhile, is in a state of complete whirlabout. Long lean knuckly hands pointing and gesticulating! '</said><said direct=False>They're still thinking of things-thinking of things! It's dreadful. They get it out of books. I can't imagine where they get it! I must watch! There're people over there whispering! Nobody ought to whisper!-There's something suggestive in the mere act! Then, pictures! In the museum-things too dreadful for words. Why can't we have pure art-with the anatomy all wrong and pure and nice-and pure fiction pure poetry, instead of all this stuff with allusions-allusions?... Excuse me! There's something up behind that locked door! The keyhole! In the interests of public morality-yes, Sir, as a pure good man-I insist-I'LL look-it won't hurt me-I insist on looking my duty-M'm'm-the keyhole!'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090995"><said direct=False>He kicked his legs about extravagantly, and I laughed again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090996"><said direct=True>"That'</said><said direct=False>s Grundy in one mood, Ponderevo. It isn't Mrs. Grundy. That's one of the lies we tell about women. They're too simple. Simple! Woman ARE simple! They take on just what men tell 'em."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090997"><said direct=False>Ewart meditated for a space. "Just exactly as it's put to them," he said, and resumed the moods of Mr. Grundy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090998"><said direct=True>"Then you get old Grundy in another mood. Ever caught him nosing, Ponderevo? Mad with the idea of mysterious, unknown, wicked, delicious things. Things that aren'</said><said direct=False>t respectable. Wow! Things he mustn't do!... Any one who knows about these things, knows there's just as much mystery and deliciousness about Grundy's forbidden things as there is about eating ham. Jolly nice if it's a bright morning and you're well and hungry and having breakfast in the open air. Jolly unattractive if you're off colour. But Grundy's covered it all up and hidden it and put mucky shades and covers over it until he's forgotten it. Begins to fester round it in his mind. Has dreadful struggles-with himself about impure thoughts.... Then you set Grundy with hot ears,-curious in undertones. Grundy on the loose, Grundy in a hoarse whisper and with furtive eyes and convulsive movements-making things indecent. Evolving-in dense vapours-indecency!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090999"><said direct=True>"Grundy sins. Oh, yes, he'</said><said direct=False>s a hypocrite. Sneaks round a corner and sins ugly. It's Grundy and his dark corners that make vice, vice! We artists-we have no vices.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901000"><said direct=True>"And then he'</said><said direct=False>s frantic with repentance. And wants to be cruel to fallen women and decent harmless sculptors of the simple nude-like me-and so back to his panic again."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901001"><said direct=True>"Mrs. Grundy, I suppose, doesn'</said><said direct=False>t know he sins," I remarked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901002"><said direct=True>"No? I'</said><said direct=False>m not so sure.... But, bless her heart she's a woman.... She's a woman. Then again you get Grundy with a large greasy smile-like an accident to a butter tub-all over his face, being Liberal Minded-Grundy in his Anti-Puritan moments, 'trying not to see Harm in it'-Grundy the friend of innocent pleasure. He makes you sick with the Harm he's trying not to see in it...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901003"><said direct=True>"And that'</said><said direct=False>s why everything's wrong, Ponderevo. Grundy, damn him! stands in the light, and we young people can't see. His moods affect us. We catch his gusts of panic, his disease of nosing, his greasiness. We don't know what we may think, what we may say, he does his silly utmost to prevent our reading and seeing the one thing, the one sort of discussion we find-quite naturally and properly-supremely interesting. So we don't adolescence; we blunder up to sex. Dare-dare to look-and he may dirt you for ever! The girls are terror-stricken to silence by his significant whiskers, by the bleary something in his eyes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901004"><said direct=False>Suddenly Ewart, with an almost Jack-in-the-box effect, sat up.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901005"><said direct=True>"He'</said><said direct=False>s about us everywhere, Ponderevo," he said, very solemnly. "Sometimes-sometimes I think he is-in our blood. In MINE."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901006"><said direct=False>He regarded me for my opinion very earnestly, with his pipe in the corner of his mouth.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901007"><said direct=True>"You'</said><said direct=False>re the remotest cousin he ever had," I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901008"><said direct=False>I reflected. "Look here, Ewart," I asked, "how would you have things different?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901009"><said direct=False>He wrinkled up his queer face, regarded the wait and made his pipe gurgle for a space, thinking deeply.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901010"><said direct=True>"There are complications, I admit. We'</said><said direct=False>ve grown up under the terror of Grundy and that innocent but docile and-yes-formidable lady, his wife. I don't know how far the complications aren't a disease, a sort of bleaching under the Grundy shadow.... It is possible there are things I have still to learn about women.... Man has eaten of the Tree of Knowledge. His innocence is gone. You can't have your cake and eat it. We're in for knowledge; let's have it plain and straight. I should begin, I think, by abolishing the ideas of decency and indecency...."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901011"><said direct=True>"Grundy would have fits!"</said><said direct=False> I injected.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901012"><said direct=True>"Grundy, Ponderevo, would have cold douches-publicly-if the sight was not too painful-three times a day.... But I don'</said><said direct=False>t think, mind you, that I should let the sexes run about together. No. The fact behind the sexes-is sex. It's no good humbugging. It trails about-even in the best mixed company. Tugs at your ankle. The men get showing off and quarrelling-and the women. Or they're bored. I suppose the ancestral males have competed for the ancestral females ever since they were both some sort of grubby little reptile. You aren't going to alter that in a thousand years or so.... Never should you have a mixed company, never-except with only one man or only one woman. How would that be?...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901013"><said direct=False>"Or duets only?...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901014"><said direct=True>"How to manage it? Some rule of etiquette, perhaps."</said><said direct=False>... He became portentously grave.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901015"><said direct=False>Then his long hand went out in weird gestures.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901016"><said direct=True>"I seem to see-I seem to see-a sort of City of Women, Ponderevo. Yes.... A walled enclosure-good stone-mason'</said><said direct=False>s work-a city wall, high as the walls of Rome, going about a garden. Dozens of square miles of garden-trees-fountains-arbours-lakes. Lawns on which the women play, avenues in which they gossip, boats.... Women like that sort of thing. Any woman who's been to a good eventful girls' school lives on the memory of it for the rest of her life. It's one of the pathetic things about women-the superiority of school and college-to anything they get afterwards. And this city-garden of women will have beautiful places for music, places for beautiful dresses, places for beautiful work. Everything a woman can want. Nurseries. Kindergartens. Schools. And no man-except to do rough work, perhaps-ever comes in. The men live in a world where they can hunt and engineer, invent and mine and manufacture, sail ships, drink deep and practice the arts, and fight-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901017"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "but-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901018"><said direct=False>He stilled me with a gesture.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901019"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>m coming to that. The homes of the women, Ponderevo, will be set in the wall of their city; each woman will have her own particular house and home, furnished after her own heart in her own manner-with a little balcony on the outside wall. Built into the wall-and a little balcony. And there she will go and look out, when the mood takes her, and all round the city there will be a broad road and seats and great shady trees. And men will stroll up and down there when they feel the need of feminine company; when, for instance, they want to talk about their souls or their characters or any of the things that only women will stand.... The women will lean over and look at the men and smile and talk to them as they fancy. And each woman will have this; she will have a little silken ladder she can let down if she chooses-if she wants to talk closer..."</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG19090202"><said direct=True>"What did he say, father?"</said><said direct=False> said Mrs. Frapp.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090203"><said direct=True>"Things I couldn'</said><said direct=False>t' repeat," said he.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090204"><said direct=True>"What things?"</said><said direct=False> I asked hotly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090205"><said direct=True>"Ask '</said><said direct=False>IM," said my uncle, pointing with his knife to his informant, and making me realise the nature of my offence. My aunt looked at the witness. "Not—?" she framed a question.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090206"><said direct=True>"Wuss,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle. "Blarsphemy."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090207"><said direct=False>My aunt couldn't touch another mouthful. I was already a little troubled in my conscience by my daring, and now I began to feel the black enormity of the course upon which I had embarked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090208"><said direct=True>"I was only talking sense,"</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090209"><said direct=False>I had a still more dreadful moment when presently I met my cousin in the brick alley behind the yard, that led back to his grocer's shop.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090210"><said direct=True>"You sneak!"</said><said direct=False> I said, and smacked his face hard forthwith. "Now then," said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090211"><said direct=False>He started back, astonished and alarmed. His eyes met mine, and I saw a sudden gleam of resolution. He turned his other cheek to me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090212"><said direct=True>"'</said><said direct=False>It 'it," he said. "'It 'it. I'LL forgive you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090213"><said direct=False>I felt I had never encountered a more detestable way of evading a licking. I shoved him against the wall and left him there, forgiving me, and went back into the house.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090214"><said direct=True>"You better not speak to your cousins, George,"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt, "till you're in a better state of mind."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090215"><said direct=False>I became an outcast forthwith. At supper that night a gloomy silence was broken by my cousin saying,</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090216"><said direct=True>"'</said><said direct=False>E 'it me for telling you, and I turned the other cheek, muvver."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090217"><said direct=True>"'</said><said direct=False>E's got the evil one be'ind 'im now, a ridin' on 'is back," said my aunt, to the grave discomfort of the eldest girl, who sat beside me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090218"><said direct=False>After supper my uncle, in a few ill-chosen words, prayed me to repent before I slept.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090219"><said direct=True>"Suppose you was took in your sleep, George,"</said><said direct=False> he said; "where'd you be then? You jest think of that me boy." By this time I was thoroughly miserable and frightened, and this suggestion unnerved me dreadfully but I kept up an impenitent front. "To wake in 'ell," said Uncle Nicodemus, in gentle tones. "You don't want to wake in 'ell, George, burnin' and screamin' for ever, do you? You wouldn't like that?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090220"><said direct=False>He tried very hard to get me to "jest 'ave a look at the bake'ouse fire" before I retired. "It might move you," he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090221"><said direct=False>I was awake longest that night. My cousins slept, the sleep of faith on either side of me. I decided I would whisper my prayers, and stopped midway because I was ashamed, and perhaps also because I had an idea one didn't square God like that.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090222"><said direct=True>"No,"</said><said direct=False> I said, with a sudden confidence, "damn me if you're coward enough.... But you're not. No! You couldn't be!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090223"><said direct=False>I woke my cousins up with emphatic digs, and told them as much, triumphantly, and went very peacefully to sleep with my act of faith accomplished.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090224"><said direct=False>I slept not only through that night, but for all my nights since then. So far as any fear of Divine injustice goes, I sleep soundly, and shall, I know, to the end of things. That declaration was an epoch in my spiritual life.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090225"><said direct=False>But I didn't expect to have the whole meeting on Sunday turned on to me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090226"><said direct=False>It was. It all comes back to me, that convergence of attention, even the faint leathery smell of its atmosphere returns, and the coarse feel of my aunt's black dress beside me in contact with my hand. I see again the old Welsh milkman "wrestling" with me, they all wrestled with me, by prayer or exhortation. And I was holding out stoutly, though convinced now by the contagion of their universal conviction that by doing so I was certainly and hopelessly damned. I felt that they were right, that God was probably like them, and that on the whole it didn't matter. And to simplify the business thoroughly I had declared I didn't believe anything at all. They confuted me by texts from Scripture which I now perceive was an illegitimate method of reply. When I got home, still impenitent and eternally lost and secretly very lonely and miserable and alarmed, Uncle Nicodemus docked my Sunday pudding.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090227"><said direct=False>One person only spoke to me like a human being on that day of wrath, and that was the younger Frapp. He came up to me in the afternoon while I was confined upstairs with a Bible and my own thoughts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090228"><said direct=True>"'</said><said direct=False>Ello," he said, and fretted about.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090229"><said direct=True>"D'</said><said direct=False>you mean to say there isn't—no one," he said, funking the word.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090230"><said direct=False>"No one?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090231"><said direct=False>"No one watching yer—always."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090232"><said direct=True>"Why should there be?"</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090233"><said direct=True>"You can'</said><said direct=False>t 'elp thoughts," said my cousin, "anyhow. You mean—" He stopped hovering. "I s'pose I oughtn't to be talking to you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090234"><said direct=False>He hesitated and flitted away with a guilty back glance over his shoulder....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090235"><said direct=False>The following week made life quite intolerable for me; these people forced me at last into an Atheism that terrified me. When I learnt that next Sunday the wrestling was to be resumed, my courage failed me altogether.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090236"><said direct=False>I happened upon a map of Kent in a stationer's window on Saturday, and that set me thinking of one form of release. I studied it intently for half an hour perhaps, on Saturday night, got a route list of villages well fixed in my memory, and got up and started for Bladesover about five on Sunday morning while my two bed mates were still fast asleep.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090237"><said direct=False>I remember something, but not so much of it as I should like to recall, of my long tramp to Bladesover House. The distance from Chatham is almost exactly seventeen miles, and it took me until nearly one. It was very interesting and I do not think I was very fatigued, though I got rather pinched by one boot.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090238"><said direct=False>The morning must have been very clear, because I remember that near Itchinstow Hall I looked back and saw the estuary of the Thames, that river that has since played so large a part in my life. But at the time I did not know it was the Thames, I thought this great expanse of mud flats and water was the sea, which I had never yet seen nearly. And out upon it stood ships, sailing ships and a steamer or so, going up to London or down out into the great seas of the world. I stood for a long time watching these and thinking whether after all I should not have done better to have run away to sea.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090239"><said direct=False>The nearer I drew to Bladesover, the more doubtful I grew of the duality of my reception, and the more I regretted that alternative. I suppose it was the dirty clumsiness of the shipping I had seen nearly, that put me out of mind of that. I took a short cut through the Warren across the corner of the main park to intercept the people from the church. I wanted to avoid meeting any one before I met my mother, and so I went to a place where the path passed between banks, and without exactly hiding, stood up among the bushes. This place among other advantages eliminated any chance of seeing Lady Drew, who would drive round by the carriage road.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090240"><said direct=False>Standing up to waylay in this fashion I had a queer feeling of brigandage, as though I was some intrusive sort of bandit among these orderly things. It is the first time I remember having that outlaw feeling distinctly, a feeling that has played a large part in my subsequent life. I felt there existed no place for me that I had to drive myself in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090241"><said direct=False>Presently, down the hill, the servants appeared, straggling by twos and threes, first some of the garden people and the butler's wife with them, then the two laundry maids, odd inseparable old creatures, then the first footman talking to the butler's little girl, and at last, walking grave and breathless beside old Ann and Miss Fison, the black figure of my mother.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090242"><said direct=False>My boyish mind suggested the adoption of a playful form of appearance. "Coo-ee, mother" said I, coming out against the sky, "Coo-ee!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090243"><said direct=False>My mother looked up, went very white, and put her hand to her bosom.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090244"><said direct=False>I suppose there was a fearful fuss about me. And of course I was quite unable to explain my reappearance. But I held out stoutly, "I won't go back to Chatham; I'll drown myself first." The next day my mother carried me off to Wimblehurst, took me fiercely and aggressively to an uncle I had never heard of before, near though the place was to us. She gave me no word as to what was to happen, and I was too subdued by her manifest wrath and humiliation at my last misdemeanour to demand information. I don't for one moment think Lady Drew was "nice" about me. The finality of my banishment was endorsed and underlined and stamped home. I wished very much now that I had run away to sea, in spite of the coal dust and squalour Rochester had revealed to me. Perhaps over seas one came to different lands.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090245"><said direct=False>I do not remember much of my journey to Wimblehurst with my mother except the image of her as sitting bolt upright, as rather disdaining the third-class carriage in which we traveled, and how she looked away from me out of the window when she spoke of my uncle. "I have not seen your uncle," she said, "since he was a boy...." She added grudgingly, "Then he was supposed to be clever."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090246"><said direct=False>She took little interest in such qualities as cleverness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090247"><said direct=False>"He married about three years ago, and set up for himself in Wimblehurst.... So I suppose she had some money."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090248"><said direct=False>She mused on scenes she had long dismissed from her mind. "Teddy," she said at last in the tone of one who has been feeling in the dark and finds. "He was called Teddy... about your age.... Now he must be twenty-six or seven."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090249"><said direct=False>I thought of my uncle as Teddy directly I saw him; there was something in his personal appearance that in the light of that memory phrased itself at once as Teddiness—a certain Teddidity. To describe it in and other terms is more difficult. It is nimbleness without grace, and alertness without intelligence. He whisked out of his shop upon the pavement, a short figure in grey and wearing grey carpet slippers; one had a sense of a young fattish face behind gilt glasses, wiry hair that stuck up and forward over the forehead, an irregular nose that had its aquiline moments, and that the body betrayed an equatorial laxity, an incipient "bow window" as the image goes. He jerked out of the shop, came to a stand on the pavement outside, regarded something in the window with infinite appreciation, stroked his chin, and, as abruptly, shot sideways into the door again, charging through it as it were behind an extended hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090250"><said direct=True>"That must be him,"</said><said direct=False> said my mother, catching at her breath.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090251"><said direct=False>We came past the window whose contents I was presently to know by heart, a very ordinary chemist's window except that there was a frictional electrical machine, an air pump and two or three tripods and retorts replacing the customary blue, yellow, and red bottles above. There was a plaster of Paris horse to indicate veterinary medicines among these breakables, and below were scent packets and diffusers and sponges and soda-water syphons and such-like things. Only in the middle there was a rubricated card, very neatly painted by hand, with these words—</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090252"><said direct=False>Buy Ponderevo's Cough Linctus NOW. NOW! WHY? Twopence Cheaper than in Winter. You Store apples! why not the Medicine You are Bound to Need?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090253"><said direct=False>in which appeal I was to recognise presently my uncle's distinctive note.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090254"><said direct=False>My uncle's face appeared above a card of infant's comforters in the glass pane of the door. I perceived his eyes were brown, and that his glasses creased his nose. It was manifest he did not know us from Adam. A stare of scrutiny allowed an expression of commercial deference to appear in front of it, and my uncle flung open the door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090255"><said direct=True>"You don'</said><said direct=False>t know me?" panted my mother.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090256"><said direct=False>My uncle would not own he did not, but his curiosity was manifest. My mother sat down on one of the little chairs before the soap and patent medicine-piled counter, and her lips opened and closed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090257"><said direct=True>"A glass of water, madam,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, waved his hand in a sort of curve and shot away.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090258"><said direct=False>My mother drank the water and spoke. "That boy," she said, "takes after his father. He grows more like him every day.... And so I have brought him to you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090259"><said direct=False>"His father, madam?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090260"><said direct=False>"George."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090261"><said direct=False>For a moment the chemist was still at a loss. He stood behind the counter with the glass my mother had returned to him in his hand. Then comprehension grew.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090262"><said direct=True>"By Gosh!"</said><said direct=False> he said. "Lord!" he cried. His glasses fell off. He disappeared replacing them, behind a pile of boxed-up bottles of blood mixture. "Eleven thousand virgins!" I heard him cry. The glass was banged down. "O—ri—ental Gums!"</said></p>
<said direct=False>"By Gosh!" he said. "Lord!" he cried. His glasses fell off. He disappeared replacing them, behind a pile of boxed-up bottles of blood mixture. "Eleven thousand virgins!" I heard him cry. The glass was banged down. "O</said><said direct=True>—ri—</said><said direct=False>ental Gums!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090263"><said direct=False>He shot away out of the shop through some masked door. One heard his voice. "Susan! Susan!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090264"><said direct=False>Then he reappeared with an extended hand. "Well, how are you?" he said. "I was never so surprised in my life. Fancy!... You!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090265"><said direct=False>He shook my mother's impassive hand and then mine very warmly holding his glasses on with his left forefinger.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090266"><said direct=True>"Come right in!"</said><said direct=False> he cried—"come right in! Better late than never!" and led the way into the parlour behind the shop.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090267"><said direct=False>After Bladesover that apartment struck me as stuffy and petty, but it was very comfortable in comparison with the Frapp living-room. It had a faint, disintegrating smell of meals about it, and my most immediate impression was of the remarkable fact that something was hung about or wrapped round or draped over everything. There was bright-patterned muslin round the gas-bracket in the middle of the room, round the mirror over the mantel, stuff with ball-fringe along the mantel and casing in the fireplace,—I first saw ball-fringe here—and even the lamp on the little bureau wore a shade like a large muslin hat. The table-cloth had ball-fringe and so had the window curtains, and the carpet was a bed of roses. There were little cupboards on either side of the fireplace, and in the recesses, ill-made shelves packed with books, and enriched with pinked American cloth. There was a dictionary lying face downward on the table, and the open bureau was littered with foolscap paper and the evidences of recently abandoned toil. My eye caught "The Ponderevo Patent Flat, a Machine you can Live in," written in large firm letters. My uncle opened a little door like a cupboard door in the corner of this room, and revealed the narrowest twist of staircase I had ever set eyes upon. "Susan!" he bawled again. "Wantje. Some one to see you. Surprisin'."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090268"><said direct=False>There came an inaudible reply, and a sudden loud bump over our heads as of some article of domestic utility pettishly flung aside, then the cautious steps of someone descending the twist, and then my aunt appeared in the doorway with her hand upon the jamb.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090269"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s Aunt Ponderevo," cried my uncle. "George's wife—and she's brought over her son!" His eye roamed about the room. He darted to the bureau with a sudden impulse, and turned the sheet about the patent flat face down. Then he waved his glasses at us, "You know, Susan, my elder brother George. I told you about 'im lots of times."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090270"><said direct=False>He fretted across to the hearthrug and took up a position there, replaced his glasses and coughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090271"><said direct=False>My aunt Susan seemed to be taking it in. She was then rather a pretty slender woman of twenty-three or four, I suppose, and I remember being struck by the blueness of her eyes and the clear freshness of her complexion. She had little features, a button nose, a pretty chin and a long graceful neck that stuck out of her pale blue cotton morning dress. There was a look of half-assumed perplexity on her face, a little quizzical wrinkle of the brow that suggested a faintly amused attempt to follow my uncle's mental operations, a vain attempt and a certain hopelessness that had in succession become habitual. She seemed to be saying, "Oh Lord! What's he giving me THIS time?" And as came to know her better I detected, as a complication of her effort of apprehension, a subsidiary riddle to "What's he giving me?" and that was—to borrow a phrase from my schoolboy language "Is it keeps?" She looked at my mother and me, and back to her husband again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090272"><said direct=True>"You know,"</said><said direct=False> he said. "George."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090273"><said direct=True>"Well,"</said><said direct=False> she said to my mother, descending the last three steps of the staircase and holding out her hand! "you're welcome. Though it's a surprise.... I can't ask you to HAVE anything, I'm afraid, for there isn't anything in the house." She smiled, and looked at her husband banteringly. "Unless he makes up something with his old chemicals, which he's quite equal to doing."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090274"><said direct=False>My mother shook hands stiffly, and told me to kiss my aunt....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090275"><said direct=True>"Well, let'</said><said direct=False>s all sit down," said my uncle, suddenly whistling through his clenched teeth, and briskly rubbing his hands together. He put up a chair for my mother, raised the blind of the little window, lowered it again, and returned to his hearthrug. "I'm sure," he said, as one who decides, "I'm very glad to see you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090276"><said direct=False>As they talked I gave my attention pretty exclusively to my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090277"><said direct=False>I noted him in great detail. I remember now his partially unbuttoned waistcoat, as though something had occurred to distract him as he did it up, and a little cut upon his chin. I liked a certain humour in his eyes. I watched, too, with the fascination that things have for an observant boy, the play of his lips—they were a little oblique, and there was something "slipshod," if one may strain a word so far, about his mouth, so that he lisped and sibilated ever and again and the coming and going of a curious expression, triumphant in quality it was, upon his face as he talked. He fingered his glasses, which did not seem to fit his nose, fretted with things in his waistcoat pockets or put his hands behind him, looked over our heads, and ever and again rose to his toes and dropped back on his heels. He had a way of drawing air in at times through his teeth that gave a whispering zest to his speech It's a sound I can only represent as a soft Zzzz.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090278"><said direct=False>He did most of the talking. My mother repeated what she had already said in the shop, "I have brought George over to you," and then desisted for a time from the real business in hand. "You find this a comfortable house?" she asked; and this being affirmed: "It looks—very convenient.... Not too big to be a trouble—no. You like Wimblehurst, I suppose?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090279"><said direct=False>My uncle retorted with some inquiries about the great people of Bladesover, and my mother answered in the character of a personal friend of Lady Drew's. The talk hung for a time, and then my uncle embarked upon a dissertation upon Wimblehurst.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090280"><said direct=True>"This place,"</said><said direct=False> he began, "isn't of course quite the place I ought to be in."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090281"><said direct=False>My mother nodded as though she had expected that.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090282"><said direct=True>"It gives me no Scope,"</said><said direct=False> he went on. "It's dead-and-alive. Nothing happens."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090283"><said direct=True>"He'</said><said direct=False>s always wanting something to happen," said my aunt Susan. "Some day he'll get a shower of things and they'll be too much for him."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090284"><said direct=True>"Not they,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, buoyantly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090285"><said direct=True>"Do you find business—slack?"</said><said direct=False> asked my mother.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090286"><said direct=True>"Oh! one rubs along. But there'</said><said direct=False>s no Development—no growth. They just come along here and buy pills when they want 'em—and a horseball or such. They've got to be ill before there's a prescription. That sort they are. You can't get 'em to launch out, you can't get 'em to take up anything new. For instance, I've been trying lately—induce them to buy their medicines in advance, and in larger quantities. But they won't look for it! Then I tried to float a little notion of mine, sort of an insurance scheme for colds; you pay so much a week, and when you've got a cold you get a bottle of Cough Linctus so long as you can produce a substantial sniff. See? But Lord! they've no capacity for ideas, they don't catch on; no Jump about the place, no Life. Live!—they trickle, and what one has to do here is to trickle too—Zzzz."</said></p>

<p n="ENG19090287"><said direct=True>"Ah!"</said><said direct=False> said my mother.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090288"><said direct=True>"It doesn'</said><said direct=False>t suit me," said my uncle. "I'm the cascading sort."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090289"><said direct=True>"George was that,"</said><said direct=False> said my mother after a pondering moment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090290"><said direct=False>My aunt Susan took up the parable with an affectionate glance at her husband.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090291"><said direct=True>"He'</said><said direct=False>s always trying to make his old business jump," she said. "Always putting fresh cards in the window, or getting up to something. You'd hardly believe. It makes ME jump sometimes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090292"><said direct=True>"But it does no good,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090293"><said direct=True>"It does no good,"</said><said direct=False> said his wife. "It's not his miloo..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090294"><said direct=False>Presently they came upon a wide pause.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090295"><said direct=False>From the beginning of their conversation there had been the promise of this pause, and I pricked my ears. I knew perfectly what was bound to come; they were going to talk of my father. I was enormously strengthened in my persuasion when I found my mother's eyes resting thoughtfully upon me in the silence, and than my uncle looked at me and then my aunt. I struggled unavailingly to produce an expression of meek stupidity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090296"><said direct=True>"I think,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, "that George will find it more amusing to have a turn in the market-place than to sit here talking with us. There's a pair of stocks there, George—very interesting. Old-fashioned stocks."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090297"><said direct=True>"I don'</said><said direct=False>t mind sitting here," I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090298"><said direct=False>My uncle rose and in the most friendly way led me through the shop. He stood on his doorstep and jerked amiable directions to me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090299"><said direct=True>"Ain'</said><said direct=False>t it sleepy, George, eh? There's the butcher's dog over there, asleep in the road—half an hour from midday! If the last Trump sounded I don't believe it would wake. Nobody would wake! The chaps up there in the churchyard—they'd just turn over and say: 'Naar—you don't catch us, you don't! See?'.... Well, you'll find the stocks just round that corner."</said></p>
<said direct=False>"Ain't it sleepy, George, eh? There's the butcher's dog over there, asleep in the road</said><said direct=True>—half an hour from midday!

Well, you'll find the stocks just round that corner."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090300"><said direct=False>He watched me out of sight.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090301"><said direct=False>So I never heard what they said about my father after all.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090302"><said direct=False>When I returned, my uncle had in some remarkable way become larger and central. "Tha'chu, George?" he cried, when the shop-door bell sounded. "Come right through"; and I found him, as it were, in the chairman's place before the draped grate.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090303"><said direct=False>The three of them regarded me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090304"><said direct=True>"We have been talking of making you a chemist, George,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090305"><said direct=False>My mother looked at me. "I had hoped," she said, "that Lady Drew would have done something for him—" She stopped.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090306"><said direct=True>"In what way?"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090307"><said direct=True>"She might have spoken to some one, got him into something perhaps...."</said><said direct=False> She had the servant's invincible persuasion that all good things are done by patronage.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090308"><said direct=True>"He is not the sort of boy for whom things are done,"</said><said direct=False> she added, dismissing these dreams. "He doesn't accommodate himself. When he thinks Lady Drew wishes a thing, he seems not to wish it. Towards Mr. Redgrave, too, he has been—disrespectful—he is like his father."</said></p>
<said direct=False>"He is not the sort of boy for whom things are done," she added, dismissing these dreams. "He doesn't accommodate himself. When he thinks Lady Drew wishes a thing, he seems not to wish it. Towards Mr. Redgrave, too, he has been</said><said direct=True>—disrespectful—</said><said direct=False>he is like his father."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090309"><said direct=True>"Who'</said><said direct=False>s Mr. Redgrave?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090310"><said direct=False>"The Vicar."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090311"><said direct=True>"A bit independent?"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, briskly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090312"><said direct=True>"Disobedient,"</said><said direct=False> said my mother. "He has no idea of his place. He seems to think he can get on by slighting people and flouting them. He'll learn perhaps before it is too late."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090313"><said direct=False>My uncle stroked his cut chin and me. "Have you learnt any Latin?" he asked abruptly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090314"><said direct=False>I said I had not.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090315"><said direct=True>"He'</said><said direct=False>ll have to learn a little Latin," he explained to my mother, "to qualify. H'm. He could go down to the chap at the grammar school here—it's just been routed into existence again by the Charity Commissioners and have lessons."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090316"><said direct=True>"What, me learn Latin!"</said><said direct=False> I cried, with emotion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090317"><said direct=True>"A little,"</said><said direct=False> he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090318"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>ve always wanted" I said and; "LATIN!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090319"><said direct=False>I had long been obsessed by the idea that having no Latin was a disadvantage in the world, and Archie Garvell had driven the point of this pretty earnestly home. The literature I had read at Bladesover had all tended that way. Latin had had a quality of emancipation for me that I find it difficult to convey. And suddenly, when I had supposed all learning was at an end for me, I heard this!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090320"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s no good to you, of course," said my uncle, "except to pass exams with, but there you are!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090321"><said direct=True>"You'</said><said direct=False>ll have to learn Latin because you have to learn Latin," said my mother, "not because you want to. And afterwards you will have to learn all sorts of other things...."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090322"><said direct=False>The idea that I was to go on learning, that to read and master the contents of books was still to be justifiable as a duty, overwhelmed all other facts. I had had it rather clear in my mind for some weeks that all that kind of opportunity might close to me for ever. I began to take a lively interest in this new project.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090323"><said direct=True>"Then shall I live here?"</said><said direct=False> I asked, "with you, and study... as well as work in the shop?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090324"><said direct=True>"That'</said><said direct=False>s the way of it," said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090325"><said direct=False>I parted from my mother that day in a dream, so sudden and important was this new aspect of things to me. I was to learn Latin! Now that the humiliation of my failure at Bladesover was past for her, now that she had a little got over her first intense repugnance at this resort to my uncle and contrived something that seemed like a possible provision for my future, the tenderness natural to a parting far more significant than any of our previous partings crept into her manner.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090326"><said direct=False>She sat in the train to return, I remember, and I stood at the open door of her compartment, and neither of us knew how soon we should cease for ever to be a trouble to one another.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090327"><said direct=True>"You must be a good boy, George,"</said><said direct=False> she said. "You must learn.... And you mustn't set yourself up against those who are above you and better than you.... Or envy them."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090328"><said direct=True>"No, mother,"</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090329"><said direct=False>I promised carelessly. Her eyes were fixed upon me. I was wondering whether I could by any means begin Latin that night.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090330"><said direct=False>Something touched her heart then, some thought, some memory; perhaps some premonition.... The solitary porter began slamming carriage doors.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090331"><said direct=True>"George"</said><said direct=False> she said hastily, almost shamefully, "kiss me!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090332"><said direct=False>I stepped up into her compartment as she bent downward.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090333"><said direct=False>She caught me in her arms quite eagerly, she pressed me to her—a strange thing for her to do. I perceived her eyes were extraordinarily bright, and then this brightness burst along the lower lids and rolled down her cheeks.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090334"><said direct=False>For the first and last time in my life I saw my mother's tears. Then she had gone, leaving me discomforted and perplexed, forgetting for a time even that I was to learn Latin, thinking of my mother as of something new and strange.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090335"><said direct=False>The thing recurred though I sought to dismiss it, it stuck itself into my memory against the day of fuller understanding. Poor, proud, habitual, sternly narrow soul! poor difficult and misunderstanding son! it was the first time that ever it dawned upon me that my mother also might perhaps feel.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090336"><said direct=False>My mother died suddenly and, it was thought by Lady Drew, inconsiderately, the following spring. Her ladyship instantly fled to Folkestone with Miss Somerville and Fison, until the funeral should be over and my mother's successor installed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090337"><said direct=False>My uncle took me over to the funeral. I remember there was a sort of prolonged crisis in the days preceding this because, directly he heard of my loss, he had sent a pair of check trousers to the Judkins people in London to be dyed black, and they did not come back in time. He became very excited on the third day, and sent a number of increasingly fiery telegrams without any result whatever, and succumbed next morning with a very ill grace to my aunt Susan's insistence upon the resources of his dress-suit. In my memory those black legs of his, in a particularly thin and shiny black cloth—for evidently his dress-suit dated from adolescent and slenderer days—straddle like the Colossus of Rhodes over my approach to my mother's funeral. Moreover, I was inconvenienced and distracted by a silk hat he had bought me, my first silk hat, much ennobled, as his was also, by a deep mourning band.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090338"><said direct=False>I remember, but rather indistinctly, my mother's white paneled housekeeper's room and the touch of oddness about it that she was not there, and the various familiar faces made strange by black, and I seem to recall the exaggerated self-consciousness that arose out of their focussed attention. No doubt the sense of the new silk hat came and went and came again in my emotional chaos. Then something comes out clear and sorrowful, rises out clear and sheer from among all these rather base and inconsequent things, and once again I walk before all the other mourners close behind her coffin as it is carried along the churchyard path to her grave, with the old vicar's slow voice saying regretfully and unconvincingly above me, triumphant solemn things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090339"><said direct=False>"I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090340"><said direct=False>Never die! The day was a high and glorious morning in spring, and all the trees were budding and bursting into green. Everywhere there were blossoms and flowers; the pear trees and cherry trees in the sexton's garden were sunlit snow, there were nodding daffodils and early tulips in the graveyard beds, great multitudes of daisies, and everywhere the birds seemed singing. And in the middle was the brown coffin end, tilting on men's shoulders and half occluded by the vicar's Oxford hood.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090341"><said direct=False>And so we came to my mother's waiting grave.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090342"><said direct=False>For a time I was very observant, watching the coffin lowered, hearing the words of the ritual. It seemed a very curious business altogether.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090343"><said direct=False>Suddenly as the service drew to its end, I felt something had still to be said which had not been said, realised that she had withdrawn in silence, neither forgiving me nor hearing from me—those now lost assurances. Suddenly I knew I had not understood. Suddenly I saw her tenderly; remembered not so much tender or kindly things of her as her crossed wishes and the ways in which I had thwarted her. Surprisingly I realised that behind all her hardness and severity she had loved me, that I was the only thing she had ever loved and that until this moment I had never loved her. And now she was there and deaf and blind to me, pitifully defeated in her designs for me, covered from me so that she could not know....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090344"><said direct=False>I dug my nails into the palms of my hands, I set my teeth, but tears blinded me, sobs would have choked me had speech been required of me. The old vicar read on, there came a mumbled response—and so on to the end. I wept as it were internally, and only when we had come out of the churchyard could I think and speak calmly again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090345"><said direct=False>Stamped across this memory are the little black figures of my uncle and Rabbits, telling Avebury, the sexton and undertaker, that "it had all passed off very well—very well indeed."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090346"><said direct=False>That is the last I shall tell of Bladesover. The dropscene falls on that, and it comes no more as an actual presence into this novel. I did indeed go back there once again, but under circumstances quite immaterial to my story. But in a sense Bladesover has never left me; it is, as I said at the outset, one of those dominant explanatory impressions that make the framework of my mind. Bladesover illuminates England; it has become all that is spacious, dignified pretentious, and truly conservative in English life. It is my social datum. That is why I have drawn it here on so large a scale.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090347"><said direct=False>When I came back at last to the real Bladesover on an inconsequent visit, everything was far smaller than I could have supposed possible. It was as though everything had shivered and shrivelled a little at the Lichtenstein touch. The harp was still in the saloon, but there was a different grand piano with a painted lid and a metrostyle pianola, and an extraordinary quantity of artistic litter and bric-a-brac scattered about. There was the trail of the Bond Street showroom over it all. The furniture was still under chintz, but it wasn't the same sort of chintz although it pretended to be, and the lustre-dangling chandeliers had passed away. Lady Lichtenstein's books replaced the brown volumes I had browsed among—they were mostly presentation copies of contemporary novels and the National Review and the Empire Review, and the Nineteenth Century and after jostled current books on the tables—English new books in gaudy catchpenny "artistic" covers, French and Italian novels in yellow, German art handbooks of almost incredible ugliness. There were abundant evidences that her ladyship was playing with the Keltic renascence, and a great number of ugly cats made of china—she "collected" china and stoneware cats—stood about everywhere—in all colours, in all kinds of deliberately comic, highly glazed distortion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090348"><said direct=False>It is nonsense to pretend that finance makes any better aristocrats than rent. Nothing can make an aristocrat but pride, knowledge, training, and the sword. These people were no improvement on the Drews, none whatever. There was no effect of a beneficial replacement of passive unintelligent people by active intelligent ones. One felt that a smaller but more enterprising and intensely undignified variety of stupidity had replaced the large dullness of the old gentry, and that was all. Bladesover, I thought, had undergone just the same change between the seventies and the new century that had overtaken the dear old Times, and heaven knows how much more of the decorous British fabric. These Lichtensteins and their like seem to have no promise in them at all of any fresh vitality for the kingdom. I do not believe in their intelligence or their power—they have nothing new about them at all, nothing creative nor rejuvenescent, no more than a disorderly instinct of acquisition; and the prevalence of them and their kind is but a phase in the broad slow decay of the great social organism of England. They could not have made Bladesover they cannot replace it; they just happen to break out over it—saprophytically.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090349"><said direct=False>Well—that was my last impression of Bladesover.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090350"><said direct=False>So far as I can remember now, except for that one emotional phase by the graveside, I passed through all these experiences rather callously. I had already, with the facility of youth, changed my world, ceased to think at all of the old school routine and put Bladesover aside for digestion at a latter stage. I took up my new world in Wimblehurst with the chemist's shop as its hub, set to work at Latin and materia medica, and concentrated upon the present with all my heart. Wimblehurst is an exceptionally quiet and grey Sussex town rare among south of England towns in being largely built of stone. I found something very agreeable and picturesque in its clean cobbled streets, its odd turnings and abrupt corners; and in the pleasant park that crowds up one side of the town. The whole place is under the Eastry dominion and it was the Eastry influence and dignity that kept its railway station a mile and three-quarters away. Eastry House is so close that it dominates the whole; one goes across the marketplace (with its old lock-up and stocks), past the great pre-reformation church, a fine grey shell, like some empty skull from which the life has fled, and there at once are the huge wrought-iron gates, and one peeps through them to see the facade of this place, very white and large and fine, down a long avenue of yews. Eastry was far greater than Bladesover and an altogether completer example of the eighteenth century system. It ruled not two villages, but a borough, that had sent its sons and cousins to parliament almost as a matter of right so long as its franchise endured. Every one was in the system, every one-except my uncle. He stood out and complained.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090351"><said direct=False>My uncle was the first real breach I found in the great front of Bladesover the world had presented me, for Chatham was not so much a breach as a confirmation. But my uncle had no respect for Bladesover and Eastry-none whatever. He did not believe in them. He was blind even to what they were. He propounded strange phrases about them, he exfoliated and wagged about novel and incredible ideas.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090352"><said direct=True>"This place,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, surveying it from his open doorway in the dignified stillness of a summer afternoon, "wants Waking Up!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090353"><said direct=False>I was sorting up patent medicines in the corner.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090354"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>d like to let a dozen young Americans loose into it," said my uncle. "Then we'd see."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090355"><said direct=False>I made a tick against Mother Shipton's Sleeping Syrup. We had cleared our forward stock.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090356"><said direct=True>"Things must be happening SOMEWHERE, George,"</said><said direct=False> he broke out in a querulously rising note as he came back into the little shop. He fiddled with the piled dummy boxes of fancy soap and scent and so forth that adorned the end of the counter, then turned about petulantly, stuck his hands deeply into his pockets and withdrew one to scratch his head. "I must do SOMETHING," he said. "I can't stand it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090357"><said direct=False>"I must invent something. And shove it.... I could.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090358"><said direct=True>"Or a play. There'</said><said direct=False>s a deal of money in a play, George. What would you think of me writing a play eh?... There's all sorts of things to be done.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090359"><said direct=False>"Or the stog-igschange."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090360"><said direct=False>He fell into that meditative whistling of his.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090361"><said direct=True>"Sac-ramental wine!"</said><said direct=False> he swore, "this isn't the world-it's Cold Mutton Fat! That's what Wimblehurst is! Cold Mutton Fat!-dead and stiff! And I'm buried in it up to the arm pits. Nothing ever happens, nobody wants things to happen 'scept me! Up in London, George, things happen. America! I wish to Heaven, George, I'd been born American-where things hum.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090362"><said direct=True>"What can one do here? How can one grow? While we'</said><said direct=False>re sleepin' here with our Capital oozing away into Lord Eastry's pockets for rent-men are up there...." He indicated London as remotely over the top of the dispensing counter, and then as a scene of great activity by a whirl of the hand and a wink and a meaning smile at me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090363"><said direct=True>"What sort of things do they do?"</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090364"><said direct=True>"Rush about,"</said><said direct=False> he said. "Do things! Somethin' glorious. There's cover gambling. Ever heard of that, George?" He drew the air in through his teeth. "You put down a hundred say, and buy ten thousand pounds worth. See? That's a cover of one per cent. Things go up one, you sell, realise cent per cent; down, whiff, it's gone! Try again! Cent per cent, George, every day. Men are made or done for in an hour. And the shoutin'! Zzzz.... Well, that's one way, George. Then another way-there's Corners!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090365"><said direct=True>"They'</said><said direct=False>re rather big things, aren't they?" I ventured.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090366"><said direct=True>"Oh, if you go in for wheat or steel-yes. But suppose you tackled a little thing, George. Just some little thing that only needed a few thousands. Drugs for example. Shoved all you had into it-staked your liver on it, so to speak. Take a drug-take ipecac, for example. Take a lot of ipecac. Take all there is! See? There you are! There aren'</said><said direct=False>t unlimited supplies of ipecacuanha-can't be!-and it's a thing people must have. Then quinine again! You watch your chance, wait for a tropical war breaking out, let's say, and collar all the quinine. Where ARE they? Must have quinine, you know. Eh? Zzzz.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090367"><said direct=True>"Lord! there'</said><said direct=False>s no end of things-no end of little things. Dill-water-all the suffering babes yowling for it. Eucalyptus again-cascara-witch hazel-menthol-all the toothache things. Then there's antiseptics, and curare, cocaine...."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090368"><said direct=True>"Rather a nuisance to the doctors,"</said><said direct=False> I reflected.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090369"><said direct=True>"They got to look out for themselves. By Jove, yes. They'</said><said direct=False>ll do you if they can, and you do them. Like brigands. That makes it romantic. That's the Romance of Commerce, George. You're in the mountains there! Think of having all the quinine in the world, and some millionaire's pampered wife gone ill with malaria, eh? That's a squeeze, George, eh? Eh? Millionaire on his motor car outside, offering you any price you liked. That 'ud wake up Wimblehurst.... Lord! You haven't an Idea down here. Not an idea. Zzzz."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090370"><said direct=False>He passed into a rapt dream, from which escaped such fragments as: "Fifty per cent. advance sir; security-to-morrow. Zzzz."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090371"><said direct=False>The idea of cornering a drug struck upon my mind then as a sort of irresponsible monkey trick that no one would ever be permitted to do in reality. It was the sort of nonsense one would talk to make Ewart laugh and set him going on to still odder possibilities. I thought it was part of my uncle's way of talking. But I've learnt differently since. The whole trend of modern money-making is to foresee something that will presently be needed and put it out of reach, and then to haggle yourself wealthy. You buy up land upon which people will presently want to build houses, you secure rights that will bar vitally important developments, and so on, and so on. Of course the naive intelligence of a boy does not grasp the subtler developments of human inadequacy. He begins life with a disposition to believe in the wisdom of grown-up people, he does not realise how casual and disingenuous has been the development of law and custom, and he thinks that somewhere in the state there is a power as irresistible as a head master's to check mischievous and foolish enterprises of every sort. I will confess that when my uncle talked of cornering quinine, I had a clear impression that any one who contrived to do that would pretty certainly go to jail. Now I know that any one who could really bring it off would be much more likely to go to the House of Lords!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090372"><said direct=False>My uncle ranged over the gilt labels of his bottles and drawers for a while, dreaming of corners in this and that. But at last he reverted to Wimblehurst again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090373"><said direct=False>"You got to be in London when these things are in hand. Down here-!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090374"><said direct=True>"Jee-rusalem!"</said><said direct=False> he cried. "Why did I plant myself here? Everything's done. The game's over. Here's Lord Eastry, and he's got everything, except what his lawyers get, and before you get any more change this way you'll have to dynamite him-and them. HE doesn't want anything more to happen. Why should he? Any chance 'ud be a loss to him. He wants everything to burble along and burble along and go on as it's going for the next ten thousand years, Eastry after Eastry, one parson down another come, one grocer dead, get another! Any one with any ideas better go away. They HAVE gone away! Look at all these blessed people in this place! Look at 'em! All fast asleep, doing their business out of habit-in a sort of dream, Stuffed men would do just as well-just. They've all shook down into their places. THEY don't want anything to happen either. They're all broken in. There you are! Only what are they all alive for?...</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090375"><said direct=True>"Why can'</said><said direct=False>t they get a clockwork chemist?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090376"><said direct=False>He concluded as he often concluded these talks. "I must invent something,-that's about what I must do. Zzzz. Some convenience. Something people want.... Strike out.... You can't think, George, of anything everybody wants and hasn't got? I mean something you could turn out retail under a shilling, say? Well, YOU think, whenever you haven't got anything better to do. See?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090377"><said direct=False>So I remember my uncle in that first phase, young, but already a little fat, restless, fretful, garrulous, putting in my fermenting head all sorts of discrepant ideas. Certainly he was educational....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090378"><said direct=False>For me the years at Wimblehurst were years of pretty active growth. Most of my leisure and much of my time in the shop I spent in study. I speedily mastered the modicum of Latin necessary for my qualifying examinations, and-a little assisted by the Government Science and Art Department classes that were held in the Grammar School-went on with my mathematics. There were classes in physics, in chemistry, in mathematics and machine drawing, and I took up these subjects with considerable avidity. Exercise I got chiefly in the form of walks. There was some cricket in the summer and football in the winter sustained by young men's clubs that levied a parasitic blackmail of the big people and the sitting member, but I was never very keen at these games. I didn't find any very close companions among the youths of Wimblehurst. They struck me, after my cockney schoolmates, as loutish and slow, servile and furtive, spiteful and mean. WE used to swagger, but these countrymen dragged their feet and hated an equal who didn't; we talked loud, but you only got the real thoughts of Wimblehurst in a knowing undertone behind its hand. And even then they weren't much in the way of thoughts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090379"><said direct=False>No, I didn't like those young countrymen, and I'm no believer in the English countryside under the Bladesover system as a breeding ground for honourable men. One hears a frightful lot of nonsense about the Rural Exodus and the degeneration wrought by town life upon our population. To my mind, the English townsman, even in the slums, is infinitely better spiritually, more courageous, more imaginative and cleaner, than his agricultural cousin. I've seen them both when they didn't think they were being observed, and I know. There was something about my Wimblehurst companions that disgusted me. It's hard to define. Heaven knows that at that cockney boarding-school at Goudhurst we were coarse enough; the Wimblehurst youngsters had neither words nor courage for the sort of thing we used to do-for our bad language, for example; but, on the other hand, they displayed a sort of sluggish, real lewdness, lewdness is the word-a baseness of attitude. Whatever we exiled urbans did at Goudhurst was touched with something, however coarse, of romantic imagination. We had read the Boys of England, and told each other stories. In the English countryside there are no books at all, no songs, no drama, no valiant sin even; all these things have never come or they were taken away and hidden generations ago, and the imagination aborts and bestialises. That, I think, is where the real difference against the English rural man lies. It is because I know this that I do not share in the common repinings because our countryside is being depopulated, because our population is passing through the furnace of the towns. They starve, they suffer, no doubt, but they come out of it hardened, they come out of it with souls.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090380"><said direct=False>Of an evening the Wimblehurst blade, shiny-faced from a wash and with some loud finery, a coloured waistcoat or a vivid tie, would betake himself to the Eastry Arms billiard-room, or to the bar parlour of some minor pub where nap could be played. One soon sickened of his slow knowingness, the cunning observation of his deadened eyes, his idea of a "good story," always, always told in undertones, poor dirty worm! his shrewd, elaborate maneuvers for some petty advantage, a drink to the good or such-like deal. There rises before my eyes as I write, young Hopley Dodd, the son of the Wimblehurst auctioneer, the pride of Wimblehurst, its finest flower, with his fur waistcoat and his bulldog pipe, his riding breeches-he had no horse-and his gaiters, as he used to sit, leaning forward and watching the billiard-table from under the brim of his artfully tilted hat. A half-dozen phrases constituted his conversation: "hard lines!" he used to say, and "Good baazness," in a bass bleat. Moreover, he had a long slow whistle that was esteemed the very cream of humorous comment. Night after night he was there.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090381"><said direct=False>Also you knew he would not understand that I could play billiards, and regarded every stroke I made as a fluke. For a beginner I didn't play so badly, I thought. I'm not so sure now; that was my opinion at the time. But young Dodd's scepticism and the "good baazness" finally cured me of my disposition to frequent the Eastry Arms, and so these noises had their value in my world.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090382"><said direct=False>I made no friends among the young men of the place at all, and though I was entering upon adolescence I have no love-affair to tell of here. Not that I was not waking up to that aspect of life in my middle teens I did, indeed, in various slightly informal ways scrape acquaintance with casual Wimblehurst girls; with a little dressmaker's apprentice I got upon shyly speaking terms, and a pupil teacher in the National School went further and was "talked about" in connection with me but I was not by any means touched by any reality of passion for either of these young people; love-love as yet came to me only in my dreams. I only kissed these girls once or twice. They rather disconcerted than developed those dreams. They were so clearly not "it." I shall have much to say of love in this story, but I may break it to the reader now that it is my role to be a rather ineffectual lover. Desire I knew well enough-indeed, too well; but love I have been shy of. In all my early enterprises in the war of the sexes, I was torn between the urgency of the body and a habit of romantic fantasy that wanted every phase of the adventure to be generous and beautiful. And I had a curiously haunting memory of Beatrice, of her kisses in the bracken and her kiss upon the wall, that somehow pitched the standard too high for Wimblehurst's opportunities. I will not deny I did in a boyish way attempt a shy, rude adventure or so in love-making at Wimblehurst; but through these various influences, I didn't bring things off to any extent at all. I left behind me no devastating memories, no splendid reputation. I came away at last, still inexperienced and a little thwarted, with only a natural growth of interest and desire in sexual things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090383"><said direct=False>If I fell in love with any one in Wimblehurst it was with my aunt. She treated me with a kindliness that was only half maternal-she petted my books, she knew about my certificates, she made fun of me in a way that stirred my heart to her. Quite unconsciously I grew fond of her....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090384"><said direct=False>My adolescent years at Wimblehurst were on the whole laborious, uneventful years that began in short jackets and left me in many ways nearly a man, years so uneventful that the Calculus of Variations is associated with one winter, and an examination in Physics for Science and Art department Honours marks an epoch. Many divergent impulses stirred within me, but the master impulse was a grave young disposition to work and learn and thereby in some not very clearly defined way get out of the Wimblehurst world into which I had fallen. I wrote with some frequency to Ewart, self-conscious, but, as I remember them, not intelligent letters, dated in Latin and with lapses into Latin quotation that roused Ewart to parody. There was something about me in those days more than a little priggish. But it was, to do myself justice, something more than the petty pride of learning. I had a very grave sense of discipline and preparation that I am not ashamed at all to remember. I was serious. More serious than I am at the present time. More serious, indeed, than any adult seems to be. I was capable then of efforts-of nobilities.... They are beyond me now. I don't see why, at forty, I shouldn't confess I respect my own youth. I had dropped being a boy quite abruptly. I thought I was presently to go out into a larger and quite important world and do significant things there. I thought I was destined to do something definite to a world that had a definite purpose. I did not understand then, as I do now, that life was to consist largely in the world's doing things to me. Young people never do seem to understand that aspect of things. And, as I say, among my educational influences my uncle, all unsuspected, played a leading part, and perhaps among other things gave my discontent with Wimblehurst, my desire to get away from that clean and picturesque emptiness, a form and expression that helped to emphasise it. In a way that definition made me patient. "Presently I shall get to London," I said, echoing him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090385"><said direct=False>I remember him now as talking, always talking, in those days. He talked to me of theology, he talked of politics, of the wonders of science and the marvels of art, of the passions and the affections, of the immortality of the soul and the peculiar actions of drugs; but predominantly and constantly he talked of getting on, of enterprises, of inventions and great fortunes, of Rothschilds, silver kings, Vanderbilts, Goulds, flotations, realisations and the marvelous ways of Chance with men-in all localities, that is to say, that are not absolutely sunken to the level of Cold Mutton Fat.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090386"><said direct=False>When I think of those early talks, I figure him always in one of three positions. Either we were in the dispensing lair behind a high barrier, he pounding up things in a mortar perhaps, and I rolling pill-stuff into long rolls and cutting it up with a sort of broad, fluted knife, or he stood looking out of the shop door against the case of sponges and spray-diffusers, while I surveyed him from behind the counter, or he leant against the little drawers behind the counter, and I hovered dusting in front. The thought of those early days brings back to my nostrils the faint smell of scent that was always in the air, marbled now with streaks of this drug and now of that, and to my eyes the rows of jejune glass bottles with gold labels, mirror-reflected, that stood behind him. My aunt, I remember, used sometimes to come into the shop in a state of aggressive sprightliness, a sort of connubial ragging expedition, and get much fun over the abbreviated Latinity of those gilt inscriptions. "Ol Amjig, George," she would read derisively, "and he pretends it's almond oil! Snap!-and that's mustard. Did you ever, George?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090387"><said direct=True>"Look at him, George, looking dignified. I'</said><said direct=False>d like to put an old label on to him round the middle like his bottles are, with Ol Pondo on it. That's Latin for Impostor, George MUST be. He'd look lovely with a stopper."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090388"><said direct=True>"YOU want a stopper,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, projecting his face....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090389"><said direct=False>My aunt, dear soul, was in those days quite thin and slender, with a delicate rosebud completion and a disposition to connubial badinage, to a sort of gentle skylarking. There was a silvery ghost of lisping in her speech. She was a great humourist, and as the constraint of my presence at meals wore off, I became more and more aware of a filmy but extensive net of nonsense she had woven about her domestic relations until it had become the reality of her life. She affected a derisive attitude to the world at large and applied the epithet "old" to more things than I have ever heard linked to it before or since. "Here's the old news-paper," she used to say-to my uncle. "Now don't go and get it in the butter, you silly old Sardine!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090390"><said direct=True>"What'</said><said direct=False>s the day of the week, Susan?" my uncle would ask.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090391"><said direct=True>"Old Monday, Sossidge,"</said><said direct=False> she would say, and add, "I got all my Old Washing to do. Don't I KNOW it!"...</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090392"><said direct=False>She had evidently been the wit and joy of a large circle of schoolfellows, and this style had become a second nature with her. It made her very delightful to me in that quiet place. Her customary walk even had a sort of hello! in it. Her chief preoccupation in life was, I believe, to make my uncle laugh, and when by some new nickname, some new quaintness or absurdity, she achieved that end, she was, behind a mask of sober amazement, the happiest woman on earth. My uncle's laugh when it did come, I must admit was, as Baedeker says, "rewarding." It began with gusty blowings and snortings, and opened into a clear "Ha ha!" but in fullest development it included, in those youthful days, falling about anyhow and doubling up tightly, and whackings of the stomach, and tears and cries of anguish. I never in my life heard my uncle laugh to his maximum except at her; he was commonly too much in earnest for that, and he didn't laugh much at all, to my knowledge, after those early years. Also she threw things at him to an enormous extent in her resolve to keep things lively in spite of Wimblehurst; sponges out of stock she threw, cushions, balls of paper, clean washing, bread; and once up the yard when they thought that I and the errand boy and the diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the way, she smashed a boxful of eight-ounce bottles I had left to drain, assaulting my uncle with a new soft broom. Sometimes she would shy things at me-but not often. There seemed always laughter round and about her-all three of us would share hysterics at times-and on one occasion the two of them came home from church shockingly ashamed of themselves, because of a storm of mirth during the sermon. The vicar, it seems, had tried to blow his nose with a black glove as well as the customary pocket-handkerchief. And afterwards she had picked up her own glove by the finger, and looking innocently but intently sideways, had suddenly by this simple expedient exploded my uncle altogether. We had it all over again at dinner.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090393"><said direct=True>"But it shows you,"</said><said direct=False> cried my uncle, suddenly becoming grave, "what Wimblehurst is, to have us all laughing at a little thing like that! We weren't the only ones that giggled. Not by any means! And, Lord! it was funny!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090394"><said direct=False>Socially, my uncle and aunt were almost completely isolated. In places like Wimblehurst the tradesmen's lives always are isolated socially, all of them, unless they have a sister or a bosom friend among the other wives, but the husbands met in various bar-parlours or in the billiard-room of the Eastry Arms. But my uncle, for the most part, spent his evenings at home. When first he arrived in Wimblehurst I think he had spread his effect of abounding ideas and enterprise rather too aggressively; and Wimblehurst, after a temporary subjugation, had rebelled and done its best to make a butt of him. His appearance in a public-house led to a pause in any conversation that was going on.</said></p>

<sample><p n="ENG190901382"><said direct=False>THE BEST PILL IN THE WORLD FOR AN IRREGULAR LIVER</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901383"><said direct=False>I suppose it is some lingering traces of the Bladesover tradition to me that makes this combination of letters and pills seem so incongruous, just as I suppose it is a lingering trace of Plutarch and my ineradicable boyish imagination that at bottom our State should be wise, sane and dignified, that makes me think a country which leaves its medical and literary criticism, or indeed any such vitally important criticism, entirely to private enterprise and open to the advances of any purchaser must be in a frankly hopeless condition. These are ideal conceptions of mine.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901384"><said direct=False>As a matter of fact, nothing would be more entirely natural and representative of the relations of learning, thought and the economic situation in the world at the present time than this cover of the Sacred Grove-the quiet conservatism of the one element embedded in the aggressive brilliance of the other; the contrasted notes of bold physiological experiment and extreme mental immobility.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901385"><said direct=False>There comes back, too, among these Hardingham memories, an impression of a drizzling November day, and how we looked out of the windows upon a procession of the London unemployed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901386"><said direct=False>It was like looking down a well into some momentarily revealed nether world. Some thousands of needy ineffectual men had been raked together to trail their spiritless misery through the West Eire with an appeal that was also in its way a weak and insubstantial threat: "It is Work we need, not Charity."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901387"><said direct=False>There they were, half-phantom through the fog, a silent, foot-dragging, interminable, grey procession. They carried wet, dirty banners, they rattled boxes for pence; these men who had not said "snap" in the right place, the men who had "snapped" too eagerly, the men who had never said "snap," the men who had never had a chance of saying "snap." A shambling, shameful stream they made, oozing along the street, the gutter waste of competitive civilisation. And we stood high out of it all, as high as if we looked godlike from another world, standing in a room beautifully lit and furnished, skillfully warmed, filled with costly things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901388"><said direct=True>"There,"</said><said direct=False> thought I, "but for the grace of God, go George and Edward Ponderevo."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901389"><said direct=False>But my uncle's thoughts ran in a different channel, and he made that vision the test of a spirited but inconclusive harangue upon Tariff Reform.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901390"><said direct=False>So far my history of my aunt and uncle has dealt chiefly with his industrial and financial exploits. But side by side with that history of inflation from the infinitesimal to the immense is another development, the change year by year from the shabby impecuniosity of the Camden Town lodging to the lavish munificence of the Crest Hill marble staircase and my aunt's golden bed, the bed that was facsimiled from Fontainebleau. And the odd thing is that as I come to this nearer part of my story I find it much more difficult to tell than the clear little perspective memories of the earlier days. Impressions crowd upon one another and overlap one another; I was presently to fall in love again, to be seized by a passion to which I still faintly respond, a passion that still clouds my mind. I came and went between Ealing and my aunt and uncle, and presently between Effie and clubland, and then between business and a life of research that became far more continuous, infinitely more consecutive and memorable than any of these other sets of experiences. I didn't witness a regular social progress therefore; my aunt and uncle went up in the world, so far as I was concerned, as if they were displayed by an early cinematograph, with little jumps and flickers.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901391"><said direct=False>As I recall this side of our life, the figure of my round-eyes, button-nosed, pink-and-white Aunt Susan tends always to the central position. We drove the car and sustained the car, she sat in it with a magnificent variety of headgear poised upon her delicate neck, and always with that faint ghost of a lisp no misspelling can render-commented on and illuminated the new aspects.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901392"><said direct=False>I've already sketched the little home behind the Wimblehurst chemist's shop, the lodging near the Cobden statue, and the apartments in Gower Street. Thence my aunt and uncle went into a flat in Redgauntlet Mansions. There they lived when I married. It was a compact flat, with very little for a woman to do in it In those days my aunt, I think, used to find the time heavy upon her hands, and so she took to books and reading, and after a time even to going to lectures in the afternoon. I began to find unexpected books upon her table: sociological books, travels, Shaw's plays. "Hullo!" I said, at the sight of some volume of the latter.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901393"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>m keeping a mind, George," she explained.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901394"><said direct=False>"Eh?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901395"><said direct=True>"Keeping a mind. Dogs I never cared for. It'</said><said direct=False>s been a toss-up between setting up a mind and setting up a soul. It's jolly lucky for Him and you it's a mind. I've joined the London Library, and I'm going in for the Royal Institution and every blessed lecture that comes along next winter. You'd better look out."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901396"><said direct=False>And I remember her coming in late one evening with a note-book in her hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901397"><said direct=True>"Where ya been, Susan?"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901398"><said direct=True>"Birkbeck-Physiology. I'</said><said direct=False>m getting on." She sat down and took off her gloves. "You're just glass to me," she sighed, and then in a note of grave reproach: "You old PACKAGE! I had no idea! The Things you've kept from me!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901399"><said direct=False>Presently they were setting; up the house at Beckengham, and my aunt intermitted her intellectual activities. The house at Beckengham was something of an enterprise for them at that time, a reasonably large place by the standards of the early years of Tono-Bungay. It was a big, rather gaunt villa, with a conservatory and a shrubbery, a tennis-lawn, a quite considerable vegetable garden, and a small disused coach-house. I had some glimpses of the excitements of its inauguration, but not many because of the estrangement between my aunt and Marion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901400"><said direct=False>My aunt went into that house with considerable zest, and my uncle distinguished himself by the thoroughness with which he did the repainting and replumbing. He had all the drains up and most of the garden with them, and stood administrative on heaps-administrating whisky to the workmen. I found him there one day, most Napoleonic, on a little Elba of dirt, in an atmosphere that defies print. He also, I remember, chose what he considered cheerful contrasts of colours for the painting of the woodwork. This exasperated my aunt extremely-she called him a "Pestilential old Splosher" with an unusual note of earnestness-and he also enraged her into novelties of abuse by giving each bedroom the name of some favourite hero-Cliff, Napoleon, Caesar, and so forth-and having it painted on the door in gilt letters on a black label. "Martin Luther" was kept for me. Only her respect for domestic discipline, she said, prevented her retaliating with "Old Pondo" on the housemaid's cupboard.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901401"><said direct=False>Also he went and ordered one of the completest sets of garden requisites I have ever seen-and had them all painted a hard clear blue. My aunt got herself large tins of a kindlier hued enamel and had everything secretly recoated, and this done, she found great joy in the garden and became an ardent rose grower and herbaceous borderer, leaving her Mind, indeed, to damp evenings and the winter months. When I think of her at Beckenham, I always think first of her as dressed in that blue cotton stuff she affected, with her arms in huge gauntleted gardening gloves, a trowel in one hand and a small but no doubt hardy and promising annual, limp and very young-looking and sheepish, in the other.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901402"><said direct=False>Beckenham, in the persons of a vicar, a doctor's wife, and a large proud lady called Hogberry, "called" on my uncle and aunt almost at once, so soon in fact as the lawn was down again, and afterwards my aunt made friends with a quiet gentlewoman next door, a propos of an overhanging cherry tree and the need of repairing the party fence. So she resumed her place in society from which she had fallen with the disaster of Wimblehurst. She made a partially facetious study of the etiquette of her position, had cards engraved and retaliated calls. And then she received a card for one of Mrs. Hogberry's At Homes, gave an old garden party herself, participated in a bazaar and sale of work, and was really becoming quite cheerfully entangled in Beckenham society when she was suddenly taken up by the roots again by my uncle and transplanted to Chiselhurst.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901403"><said direct=True>"Old Trek, George,"</said><said direct=False> she said compactly, "Onward and Up," when I found her superintending the loading of two big furniture vans. "Go up and say good-bye to 'Martin Luther,' and then I'll see what you can do to help me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901404"><said direct=False>I look into the jumbled stores of the middle distance of memory, and Beckenham seems to me a quite transitory phase. But really they were there several years; through nearly all my married life, in fact, and far longer than the year and odd months we lived together at Wimblehurst. But the Wimblehurst time with them is fuller in my memory by far then the Beckenham period. There comes back to me with a quite considerable amount of detail the effect of that garden party of my aunt's and of a little social misbehaviour of which I was guilty on that occasion. It's like a scrap from another life. It's all set in what is for me a kind of cutaneous feeling, the feeling of rather ill-cut city clothes, frock coat and grey trousers, and of a high collar and tie worn in sunshine among flowers. I have still a quite vivid memory of the little trapezoidal lawn, of the gathering, and particularly of the hats and feathers of the gathering, of the parlour-maid and the blue tea-cups, and of the magnificent presence of Mrs. Hogberry and of her clear, resonant voice. It was a voice that would have gone with a garden party on a larger scale; it went into adjacent premises; it included the gardener who was far up the vegetable patch and technically out of play. The only other men were my aunt's doctor, two of the clergy, amiable contrasted men, and Mrs. Hogberry's imperfectly grown-up son, a youth just bursting into collar. The rest were women, except for a young girl or so in a state of speechless good behaviour. Marion also was there.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901405"><said direct=False>Marion and I had arrived a little estranged, and I remember her as a silent presence, a shadow across all that sunlit emptiness of intercourse. We had embittered each other with one of those miserable little disputes that seemed so unavoidable between us. She had, with the help of Smithie, dressed rather elaborately for the occasion, and when she saw me prepared to accompany her in, I think it was a grey suit, she protested that silk hat and frock coat were imperative. I was recalcitrant, she quoted an illustrated paper showing a garden party with the King present, and finally I capitulated-but after my evil habit, resentfully.... Eh, dear! those old quarrels, how pitiful they were, how trivial! And how sorrowful they are to recall! I think they grow more sorrowful as I grow older, and all the small passionate reasons for our mutual anger fade and fade out of memory.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901406"><said direct=False>The impression that Beckenham company has left on my mind is one of a modest unreality; they were all maintaining a front of unspecified social pretension, and evading the display of the economic facts of the case. Most of the husbands were "in business" off stage, it would have been outrageous to ask what the business was-and the wives were giving their energies to produce, with the assistance of novels and the illustrated magazines, a moralised version of the afternoon life of the aristocratic class. They hadn't the intellectual or moral enterprise of the upper-class woman, they had no political interests, they had no views about anything, and consequently they were, I remember, extremely difficult to talk to. They all sat about in the summer-house and in garden-chairs, and were very hatty and ruffley and sunshady. Three ladies and the curate played croquet with a general immense gravity, broken by occasional loud cries of feigned distress from the curate. "Oh! Whacking me about again! Augh!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901407"><said direct=False>The dominant social fact that afternoon was Mrs. Hogberry; she took up a certain position commanding the croquet and went on, as my aunt said to me in an incidental aside, "like an old Roundabout." She talked of the way in which Beckenham society was getting mixed, and turned on to a touching letter she had recently received from her former nurse at Little Gossdean. Followed a loud account of Little Gossdean and how much she and her eight sisters had been looked up to there. "My poor mother was quite a little Queen there," she said. "And such NICE Common people! People say the country labourers are getting disrespectful nowadays. It isn't so-not if they're properly treated. Here of course in Beckenham it's different. I won't call the people we get here a Poor-they're certainly not a proper Poor. They're Masses. I always tell Mr. Bugshoot they're Masses, and ought to be treated as such."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901408"><said direct=False>Dim memories of Mrs. Mackridge floated through my mind as I listened to her....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901409"><said direct=False>I was whirled on this roundabout for a bit, and then had the fortune to fall off into a tete-a-tete with a lady whom my aunt introduced as Mrs. Mumble-but then she introduced everybody to me as Mumble that afternoon, either by way of humour or necessity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901410"><said direct=False>That must have been one of my earliest essays in the art of polite conversation, and I remember that I began by criticising the local railway service, and that at the third sentence or thereabouts Mrs. Mumble said in a distinctly bright and encouraging way that she feared I was a very "frivolous" person.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901411"><said direct=False>I wonder now what it was I said that was "frivolous."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901412"><said direct=False>I don't know what happened to end that conversation, or if it had an end. I remember talking to one of the clergy for a time rather awkwardly, and being given a sort of topographical history of Beckenham, which he assured me time after time was "Quite an old place. Quite an old place." As though I had treated it as new and he meant to be very patient but very convincing. Then we hung up in a distinct pause, and my aunt rescued me. "George," she said in a confidential undertone, "keep the pot a-boiling." And then audibly, "I say, will you both old trot about with tea a bit?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901413"><said direct=True>"Only too delighted to TROT for you, Mrs. Ponderevo,"</said><said direct=False> said the clergyman, becoming fearfully expert and in his elements; "only too delighted."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901414"><said direct=False>I found we were near a rustic table, and that the housemaid was behind us in a suitable position to catch us on the rebound with the tea things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901415"><said direct=True>"Trot!"</said><said direct=False> repeated the clergyman to me, much amused; "excellent expression!" And I just saved him from the tray as he turned about.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901416"><said direct=False>We handed tea for a while....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901417"><said direct=True>"Give '</said><said direct=False>em cakes," said my aunt, flushed, but well in hand. "Helps 'em to talk, George. Always talk best after a little nourishment. Like throwing a bit of turf down an old geyser."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901418"><said direct=False>She surveyed the gathering with a predominant blue eye and helped herself to tea.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901419"><said direct=True>"They keep on going stiff,"</said><said direct=False> she said in an undertone.... "I've done my best."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901420"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s been a huge success," I said encouragingly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901421"><said direct=True>"That boy has had his legs crossed in that position and hasn'</said><said direct=False>t spoken for ten minutes. Stiffer and stiffer. Brittle. He's beginning a dry cough-always a bad sign, George.... Walk 'em about, shall I?-rub their noses with snow?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901422"><said direct=False>Happily she didn't. I got myself involved with the gentlewoman from next door, a pensive, languid-looking little woman with a low voice, and fell talking; our topic, Cats and Dogs, and which it was we liked best.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901423"><said direct=True>"I always feel,"</said><said direct=False> said the pensive little woman, "that there's something about a dog-A cat hasn't got it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901424"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> I found myself admitting with great enthusiasm, "there is something. And yet again-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901425"><said direct=True>"Oh! I know there'</said><said direct=False>s something about a cat, too. But it isn't the same."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901426"><said direct=True>"Not quite the same,"</said><said direct=False> I admitted; "but still it's something."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901427"><said direct=False>"Ah! But such a different something!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901428"><said direct=False>"More sinuous."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901429"><said direct=False>"Much more."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901430"><said direct=False>"Ever so much more."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901431"><said direct=True>"It makes all the difference, don'</said><said direct=False>t you think?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901432"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "ALL."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901433"><said direct=False>She glanced at me gravely and sighed a long, deeply felt "Yes." A long pause.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901434"><said direct=False>The thing seemed to me to amount to a stale-mate. Fear came into my heart and much perplexity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901435"><said direct=True>"The-er-Roses,"</said><said direct=False> I said. I felt like a drowning man. "Those roses-don't you think they are-very beautiful flowers?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901436"><said direct=True>"Aren'</said><said direct=False>t they!" she agreed gently. "There seems to be something in roses-something-I don't know how to express it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901437"><said direct=True>"Something,"</said><said direct=False> I said helpfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901438"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> she said, "something. Isn't there?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901439"><said direct=True>"So few people see it,"</said><said direct=False> I said; "more's the pity!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901440"><said direct=False>She sighed and said again very softly, "Yes."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901441"><said direct=False>There was another long pause. I looked at her and she was thinking dreamily. The drowning sensation returned, the fear and enfeeblement. I perceived by a sort of inspiration that her tea-cup was empty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901442"><said direct=True>"Let me take your cup,"</said><said direct=False> I said abruptly, and, that secured, made for the table by the summer-house. I had no intention then of deserting my aunt. But close at hand the big French window of the drawing-room yawned inviting and suggestive. I can feel all that temptation now, and particularly the provocation of my collar. In an instant I was lost. I would-Just for a moment!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901443"><said direct=False>I dashed in, put down the cup on the keys of the grand piano and fled upstairs, softly, swiftly, three steps at a time, to the sanctuary of my uncle's study, his snuggery. I arrived there breathless, convinced there was no return for me. I was very glad and ashamed of myself, and desperate. By means of a penknife I contrived to break open his cabinet of cigars, drew a chair to the window, took off my coat, collar and tie, and remained smoking guiltily and rebelliously, and peeping through the blind at the assembly on the lawn until it was altogether gone....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901444"><said direct=False>The clergymen, I thought, were wonderful.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901445"><said direct=False>A few such pictures of those early days at Beckenham stand out, and then I find myself among the Chiselhurst memories. The Chiselhurst mansion had "grounds" rather than a mere garden, and there was a gardener's cottage and a little lodge at the gate. The ascendant movement was always far more in evidence there than at Beckenham. The velocity was increasing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901446"><said direct=False>One night picks itself out as typical, as, in its way, marking an epoch. I was there, I think, about some advertisement stuff, on some sort of business anyhow, and my uncle and aunt had come back in a fly from a dinner at the Runcorns. (Even there he was nibbling at Runcorn with the idea of our great Amalgamation budding in his mind.) I got down there, I suppose, about eleven. I found the two of them sitting in the study, my aunt on a chair-arm with a whimsical pensiveness on her face, regarding my uncle, and he, much extended and very rotund, in the low arm-chair drawn up to the fender.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901447"><said direct=True>"Look here, George,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, after my first greetings. "I just been saying: We aren't Oh Fay!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901448"><said direct=False>"Eh?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901449"><said direct=False>"Not Oh Fay! Socially!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901450"><said direct=False>"Old FLY, he means, George-French!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901451"><said direct=True>"Oh! Didn'</said><said direct=False>t think of French. One never knows where to have him. What's gone wrong to-night?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901452"><said direct=True>"I been thinking. It isn'</said><said direct=False>t any particular thing. I ate too much of that fishy stuff at first, like salt frog spawn, and was a bit confused by olives; and-well, I didn't know which wine was which. Had to say THAT each time. It puts your talk all wrong. And she wasn't in evening dress, not like the others. We can't go on in that style, George-not a proper ad."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901453"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>m not sure you were right," I said, "in having a fly."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901454"><said direct=True>"We got to do it all better,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, "we got to do it in Style. Smart business, smart men. She tries to pass it off as humorous"-my aunt pulled a grimace-"it isn't humorous! See! We're on the up-grade now, fair and square. We're going to be big. We aren't going to be laughed at as Poovenoos, see!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901455"><said direct=True>"Nobody laughed at you,"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt. "Old Bladder!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901456"><said direct=True>"Nobody isn'</said><said direct=False>t going to laugh at me," said my uncle, glancing at his contours and suddenly sitting up.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901457"><said direct=False>My aunt raised her eyebrows slightly, swung her foot, and said nothing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901458"><said direct=True>"We aren'</said><said direct=False>t keeping pace with our own progress, George. We got to. We're bumping against new people, and they set up to be gentlefolks-etiquette dinners and all the rest of it. They give themselves airs and expect us to be fish-out-of-water. We aren't going to be. They think we've no Style. Well, we give them Style for our advertisements, and we're going to give 'em Style all through.... You needn't be born to it to dance well on the wires of the Bond Street tradesmen. See?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901459"><said direct=False>I handed him the cigar-box.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901460"><said direct=True>"Runcorn hadn'</said><said direct=False>t cigars like these," he said, truncating one lovingly. "We beat him at cigars. We'll beat him all round."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901461"><said direct=False>My aunt and I regarded him, full of apprehensions.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901462"><said direct=True>"I got idees,"</said><said direct=False> he said darkly to the cigar, deepening our dread.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901463"><said direct=False>He pocketed his cigar-cutter and spoke again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901464"><said direct=True>"We got to learn all the rotten little game first. See, F'</said><said direct=False>rinstance, we got to get samples of all the blessed wines there are-and learn 'em up. Stern, Smoor, Burgundy, all of 'em! She took Stern to-night-and when she tasted it first-you pulled a face, Susan, you did. I saw you. It surprised you. You bunched your nose. We got to get used to wine and not do that. We got to get used to wearing evening dress-YOU, Susan, too."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901465"><said direct=True>"Always have had a tendency to stick out of my clothes,"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt. "However-Who cares?" She shrugged her shoulders.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901466"><said direct=False>I had never seen my uncle so immensely serious.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901467"><said direct=True>"Got to get the hang of etiquette,"</said><said direct=False> he went on to the fire. "Horses even. Practise everything. Dine every night in evening dress.... Get a brougham or something. Learn up golf and tennis and things. Country gentleman. Oh Fay. It isn't only freedom from Goochery."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901468"><said direct=True>"Eh?"</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901469"><said direct=False>"Oh!-Gawshery, if you like!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901470"><said direct=True>"French, George,"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt. "But I'M not ol' Gooch. I made that face for fun."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901471"><said direct=True>"It isn'</said><said direct=False>t only freedom from Gawshery. We got to have Style. See! Style! Just all right and one better. That's what I call Style. We can do it, and we will."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901472"><said direct=False>He mumbled his cigar and smoked for a space, leaning forward and looking into the fire.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901473"><said direct=True>"What is it,"</said><said direct=False> he asked, "after all? What is it? Tips about eating; tips about drinking. Clothes. How to hold yourself, and not say jes' the few little things they know for certain are wrong-jes' the shibboleth things."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901474"><said direct=False>He was silent again, and the cigar crept up from the horizontal towards the zenith as the confidence of his mouth increased.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901475"><said direct=True>"Learn the whole bag of tricks in six months."</said><said direct=False> he said, becoming more cheerful. "Ah, Susan? Beat it out! George, you in particular ought to get hold of it. Ought to get into a good club, and all that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901476"><said direct=True>"Always ready to learn!"</said><said direct=False> I said. "Ever since you gave me the chance of Latin. So far we don't seem to have hit upon any Latin-speaking stratum in the population."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901477"><said direct=True>"We'</said><said direct=False>ve come to French," said my aunt, "anyhow."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901478"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s a very useful language," said my uncle. "Put a point on things. Zzzz. As for accent, no Englishman has an accent. No Englishman pronounces French properly. Don't you tell ME. It's a Bluff.-It's all a Bluff. Life's a Bluff-practically. That's why it's so important, Susan, for us to attend to Style. Le Steel Say Lum. The Style it's the man. Whad you laughing at, Susan? George, you're not smoking. These cigars are good for the mind.... What do YOU think of it all? We got to adapt ourselves. We have-so far.... Not going to be beat by these silly things."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901479"><said direct=True>"What do you think of it, George?"</said><said direct=False> he insisted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901480"><said direct=False>What I said I thought of it I don't now recall. Only I have very distinctly the impression of meeting for a moment my aunt's impenetrable eye. And anyhow he started in with his accustomed energy to rape the mysteries of the Costly Life, and become the calmest of its lords. On the whole, I think he did it-thoroughly. I have crowded memories, a little difficult to disentangle, of his experimental stages, his experimental proceedings. It's hard at times to say which memory comes in front of which. I recall him as presenting on the whole a series of small surprises, as being again and again, unexpectedly, a little more self-confident, a little more polished, a little richer and finer, a little more aware of the positions and values of things and men.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901481"><said direct=False>There was a time-it must have been very early-when I saw him deeply impressed by the splendours of the dining-room of the National Liberal Club. Heaven knows who our host was or what that particular little "feed" was about now!-all that sticks is the impression of our straggling entry, a string of six or seven guests, and my uncle looking about him at the numerous bright red-shaded tables, at the exotics in great Majolica jars, at the shining ceramic columns and pilasters, at the impressive portraits of Liberal statesmen and heroes, and all that contributes to the ensemble of that palatial spectacle. He was betrayed into a whisper to me, "This is all Right, George!" he said. That artless comment seems almost incredible as I set it down; there came a time so speedily when not even the clubs of New York could have overawed my uncle, and when he could walk through the bowing magnificence of the Royal Grand Hotel to his chosen table in that aggressively exquisite gallery upon the river, with all the easy calm of one of earth's legitimate kings.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901482"><said direct=False>The two of them learnt the new game rapidly and well; they experimented abroad, they experimented at home. At Chiselhurst, with the aid of a new, very costly, but highly instructive cook, they tried over everything they heard of that roused their curiosity and had any reputation for difficulty, from asparagus to plover's eggs. They afterwards got a gardener who could wait at table-and he brought the soil home to one. Then there came a butler.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901483"><said direct=False>I remember my aunt's first dinner-gown very brightly, and how she stood before the fire in the drawing-room confessing once unsuspected pretty arms with all the courage she possessed, and looking over her shoulder at herself in a mirror.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901484"><said direct=True>"A ham,"</said><said direct=False> she remarked reflectively, "must feel like this. Just a necklace."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901485"><said direct=False>I attempted, I think, some commonplace compliment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901486"><said direct=False>My uncle appeared at the door in a white waistcoat and with his hands in his trouser pockets; he halted and surveyed her critically.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901487"><said direct=True>"Couldn'</said><said direct=False>t tell you from a duchess, Susan," he remarked. "I'd like to have you painted, standin' at the fire like that. Sargent! You look-spirited, somehow. Lord!-I wish some of those damned tradesmen at Wimblehurst could see you."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901488"><said direct=False>They did a lot of week-ending at hotels, and sometimes I went down with them. We seemed to fall into a vast drifting crowd of social learners. I don't know whether it is due simply to my changed circumstances, but it seems to me there have been immensely disproportionate developments of the hotel-frequenting and restaurant-using population during the last twenty years. It is not only, I think, that there are crowds of people who, like we were, are in the economically ascendant phase, but whole masses of the prosperous section of the population must be altering its habits, giving up high-tea for dinner and taking to evening dress, using the week-end hotels as a practise-ground for these new social arts. A swift and systematic conversion to gentility has been going on, I am convinced, throughout the whole commercial upper-middle class since I was twenty-one. Curiously mixed was the personal quality of the people one saw in these raids. There were conscientiously refined and low-voiced people reeking with proud bashfulness; there were aggressively smart people using pet diminutives for each other loudly and seeking fresh occasions for brilliant rudeness; there were awkward husbands and wives quarrelling furtively about their manners and ill at ease under the eye of the winter; cheerfully amiable and often discrepant couples with a disposition to inconspicuous corners, and the jolly sort, affecting an unaffected ease; plump happy ladies who laughed too loud, and gentlemen in evening dress who subsequently "got their pipes." And nobody, you knew, was anybody, however expensively they dressed and whatever rooms they took.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901489"><said direct=False>I look back now with a curious remoteness of spirit to those crowded dining-rooms with their dispersed tables and their inevitable red-shaded lights and the unsympathetic, unskillful waiters, and the choice of "Thig or Glear, Sir?" I've not dined in that way, in that sort of place, now for five years-it must be quite five years, so specialised and narrow is my life becoming.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901490"><said direct=False>My uncle's earlier motor-car phases work in with these associations, and there stands out a little bright vignette of the hall of the Magnificent, Bexhill-on-Sea, and people dressed for dinner and sitting about amidst the scarlet furniture-satin and white-enameled woodwork until the gong should gather them; and my aunt is there, very marvelously wrapped about in a dust cloak and a cage-like veil, and there are hotel porters and under-porters very alert, and an obsequious manager; and the tall young lady in black from the office is surprised into admiration, and in the middle of the picture is my uncle, making his first appearance in that Esquimaux costume I have already mentioned, a short figure, compactly immense, hugely goggled, wearing a sort of brown rubber proboscis, and surmounted by a table-land of motoring cap.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901491"><said direct=False>So it was we recognised our new needs as fresh invaders of the upper levels of the social system, and set ourselves quite consciously to the acquisition of Style and Savoir Faire. We became part of what is nowadays quite an important element in the confusion of our world, that multitude of economically ascendant people who are learning how to spend money. It is made up of financial people, the owners of the businesses that are eating up their competitors, inventors of new sources of wealth, such as ourselves; it includes nearly all America as one sees it on the European stage. It is a various multitude having only this in common: they are all moving, and particularly their womankind are moving, from conditions in which means were insistently finite, things were few, and customs simple, towards a limitless expenditure and the sphere of attraction of Bond Street, Fifth Avenue, and Paris. Their general effect is one of progressive revolution, of limitless rope.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901492"><said direct=False>They discover suddenly indulgences their moral code never foresaw and has no provision for, elaborations, ornaments, possessions beyond their wildest dreams. With an immense astonished zest they begin shopping begin a systematic adaptation to a new life crowded and brilliant with things shopped, with jewels, maids, butlers, coachmen, electric broughams, hired town and country houses. They plunge into it as one plunges into a career; as a class, they talk, think, and dream possessions. Their literature, their Press, turns all on that; immense illustrated weeklies of unsurpassed magnificence guide them in domestic architecture, in the art of owning a garden, in the achievement of the sumptuous in motor-cars, in an elaborate sporting equipment, in the purchase and control of their estates, in travel and stupendous hotels. Once they begin to move they go far and fast. Acquisition becomes the substance of their lives. They find a world organised to gratify that passion. In a brief year or so they are connoisseurs. They join in the plunder of the eighteenth century, buy rare old books, fine old pictures, good old furniture. Their first crude conception of dazzling suites of the newly perfect is replaced almost from the outset by a jackdaw dream of accumulating costly discrepant old things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901493"><said direct=False>I seem to remember my uncle taking to shopping quite suddenly. In the Beckenham days and in the early Chiselhurst days he was chiefly interested in getting money, and except for his onslaught on the Beckenham house, bothered very little about his personal surroundings and possessions. I forget now when the change came and he began to spend. Some accident must have revealed to him this new source of power, or some subtle shifting occurred in the tissues of his brain. He began to spend and "shop." So soon as he began to shop, he began to shop violently. He began buying pictures, and then, oddly enough, old clocks. For the Chiselhurst house he bought nearly a dozen grandfather clocks and three copper warming pans. After that he bought much furniture. Then he plunged into art patronage, and began to commission pictures and to make presents to churches and institutions. His buying increased with a regular acceleration. Its development was a part of the mental changes that came to him in the wild excitements of the last four years of his ascent. Towards the climax he was a furious spender; he shopped with large unexpected purchases, he shopped like a mind seeking expression, he shopped to astonish and dismay; shopped crescendo, shopped fortissimo, con molto espressione until the magnificent smash of Crest Hill eroded his shopping for ever. Always it was he who shopped. My aunt did not shine as a purchaser. It is a curious thing, due to I know not what fine strain in her composition, that my aunt never set any great store upon possessions. She plunged through that crowded bazaar of Vanity Fair during those feverish years, spending no doubt freely and largely, but spending with detachment and a touch of humorous contempt for the things, even the "old" things, that money can buy. It came to me suddenly one afternoon just how detached she was, as I saw her going towards the Hardingham, sitting up, as she always did, rather stiffly in her electric brougham, regarding the glittering world with interested and ironically innocent blue eyes from under the brim of a hat that defied comment. "No one," I thought, "would sit so apart if she hadn't dreams-and what are her dreams?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901494"><said direct=False>I'd never thought.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901495"><said direct=False>And I remember, too, an outburst of scornful description after she had lunched with a party of women at the Imperial Cosmic Club. She came round to my rooms on the chance of finding me there, and I gave her tea. She professed herself tired and cross, and flung herself into my chair....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901496"><said direct=True>"George,"</said><said direct=False> she cried, "the Things women are! Do I stink of money?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901497"><said direct=True>"Lunching?"</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901498"><said direct=False>She nodded.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901499"><said direct=False>"Plutocratic ladies?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901500"><said direct=False>"Yes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901501"><said direct=False>"Oriental type?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901502"><said direct=False>"Oh! Like a burst hareem!... Bragging of possessions.... They feel you. They feel your clothes, George, to see if they are good!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901503"><said direct=False>I soothed her as well as I could. "They ARE Good aren't they?" I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901504"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s the old pawnshop in their blood," she said, drinking tea; and then in infinite disgust, "They run their hands over your clothes-they paw you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901505"><said direct=False>I had a moment of doubt whether perhaps she had not been discovered in possession of unsuspected forgeries. I don't know. After that my eyes were quickened, and I began to see for myself women running their hands over other women's furs, scrutinising their lace, even demanding to handle jewelry, appraising, envying, testing. They have a kind of etiquette. The woman who feels says, "What beautiful sables?" "What lovely lace?" The woman felt admits proudly: "It's Real, you know," or disavows pretension modestly and hastily, "It's Rot Good." In each other's houses they peer at the pictures, handle the selvage of hangings, look at the bottoms of china....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901506"><said direct=False>I wonder if it IS the old pawnshop in the blood.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901507"><said direct=False>I doubt if Lady Drew and the Olympians did that sort of thing, but here I may be only clinging to another of my former illusions about aristocracy and the State. Perhaps always possessions have been Booty, and never anywhere has there been such a thing as house and furnishings native and natural to the women and men who made use of them....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901508"><said direct=False>For me, at least, it marked an epoch in my uncle's career when I learnt one day that he had "shopped" Lady Grove. I realised a fresh, wide, unpreluded step. He took me by surprise with the sudden change of scale from such portable possessions as jewels and motor-cars to a stretch of countryside. The transaction was Napoleonic; he was told of the place; he said "snap"; there were no preliminary desirings or searchings. Then he came home and said what he had done. Even my aunt was for a day or so measurably awestricken by this exploit in purchase, and we both went down with him to see the house in a mood near consternation. It struck us then as a very lordly place indeed. I remember the three of us standing on the terrace that looked westward, surveying the sky-reflecting windows of the house, and a feeling of unwarrantable intrusion comes back to me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901509"><said direct=False>Lady Grove, you know, is a very beautiful house indeed, a still and gracious place, whose age-long seclusion was only effectively broken with the toot of the coming of the motor-car. An old Catholic family had died out in it, century by century, and was now altogether dead. Portions of the fabric are thirteenth century, and its last architectural revision was Tudor; within, it is for the most part dark and chilly, save for two or three favoured rooms and its tall-windowed, oak-galleried hall. Its terrace is its noblest feature; a very wide, broad lawn it is, bordered by a low stone battlement, and there is a great cedar in one corner under whose level branches one looks out across the blue distances of the Weald, blue distances that are made extraordinarily Italian in quality by virtue of the dark masses of that single tree. It is a very high terrace; southward one looks down upon the tops of wayfaring trees and spruces, and westward on a steep slope of beechwood, through which the road comes. One turns back to the still old house, and sees a grey and lichenous facade with a very finely arched entrance. It was warmed by the afternoon light and touched with the colour of a few neglected roses and a pyracanthus. It seemed to me that the most modern owner conceivable in this serene fine place was some bearded scholarly man in a black cassock, gentle-voiced and white-handed, or some very soft-robed, grey gentlewoman. And there was my uncle holding his goggles in a sealskin glove, wiping the glass with a pocket-handkerchief, and asking my aunt if Lady Grove wasn't a "Bit of all Right."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901510"><said direct=False>My aunt made him no answer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901511"><said direct=True>"The man who built this,"</said><said direct=False> I speculated, "wore armour and carried a sword."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901512"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s some of it inside still," said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901513"><said direct=False>We went inside. An old woman with very white hair was in charge of the place and cringed rather obviously to the new master. She evidently found him a very strange and frightful apparition indeed, and was dreadfully afraid of him. But if the surviving present bowed down to us, the past did not. We stood up to the dark, long portraits of the extinguished race-one was a Holbein-and looked them in their sidelong eyes. They looked back at us. We all, I know, felt the enigmatical quality in them. Even my uncle was momentarily embarrassed, I think, by that invincibly self-complacent expression. It was just as though, after all, he had not bought them up and replaced them altogether; as though that, secretly, they knew better and could smile at him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901514"><said direct=False>The spirit of the place was akin to Bladesover, but touched with something older and remoter. That armour that stood about had once served in tilt-yards, if indeed it had not served in battle, and this family had sent its blood and treasure, time after time, upon the most romantic quest in history, to Palestine. Dreams, loyalties, place and honour, how utterly had it all evaporated, leaving, at last, the final expression of its spirit, these quaint painted smiles, these smiles of triumphant completion! It had evaporated, indeed, long before the ultimate Durgan had died, and in his old age he had cumbered the place with Early Victorian cushions and carpets and tapestry table-cloths and invalid appliances of a type even more extinct, it seemed to us, than the crusades.... Yes, it was different from Bladesover.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901515"><said direct=True>"Bit stuffy, George,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle. "They hadn't much idea of ventilation when this was built."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901516"><said direct=False>One of the panelled rooms was half-filled with presses and a four-poster bed. "Might be the ghost room," said my uncle; but it did not seem to me that so retiring a family as the Durgans, so old and completely exhausted a family as the Durgans, was likely to haunt anybody. What living thing now had any concern with their honour and judgments and good and evil deeds? Ghosts and witchcraft were a later innovation-that fashion came from Scotland with the Stuarts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901517"><said direct=False>Afterwards, prying for epitaphs, we found a marble crusader with a broken nose, under a battered canopy of fretted stone, outside the restricted limits of the present Duffield church, and half buried in nettles. "Ichabod," said my uncle. "Eh? We shall be like that, Susan, some day.... I'm going to clean him up a bit and put a railing to keep off the children."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901518"><said direct=True>"Old saved at the eleventh hour,"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt, quoting one of the less successful advertisements of Tono-Bungay.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901519"><said direct=False>But I don't think my uncle heard her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901520"><said direct=False>It was by our captured crusader that the vicar found us. He came round the corner at us briskly, a little out of breath. He had an air of having been running after us since the first toot of our horn had warned the village of our presence. He was an Oxford man, clean-shaven, with a cadaverous complexion and a guardedly respectful manner, a cultivated intonation, and a general air of accommodation to the new order of things. These Oxford men are the Greeks of our plutocratic empire. He was a Tory in spirit, and what one may call an adapted Tory by stress of circumstances; that is to say, he was no longer a legitimist; he was prepared for the substitution of new lords for old. We were pill vendors he knew, and no doubt horribly vulgar in soul; but then it might have been some polygamous Indian rajah, a great strain on a good man's tact, or some Jew with an inherited expression of contempt. Anyhow, we were English, and neither Dissenters nor Socialists, and he was cheerfully prepared to do what he could to make gentlemen of both of us. He might have preferred Americans for some reasons; they are not so obviously taken from one part of the social system and dumped down in another, and they are more teachable; but in this world we cannot always be choosers. So he was very bright and pleasant with us, showed us the church, gossiped informingly about our neighbours on the countryside-Tux, the banker; Lord Boom, the magazine and newspaper proprietor; Lord Carnaby, that great sportsman, and old Lady Osprey. And finally he took us by way of a village lane-three children bobbed convulsively with eyes of terror for my uncle-through a meticulous garden to a big, slovenly Vicarage with faded Victorian furniture and a faded Victorian wife, who gave us tea and introduced us to a confusing family dispersed among a lot of disintegrating basket chairs upon the edge of a well-used tennis lawn.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901521"><said direct=False>These people interested me. They were a common type, no doubt, but they were new to me. There were two lank sons who had been playing singles at tennis, red-eared youths growing black moustaches, and dressed in conscientiously untidy tweeds and unbuttoned and ungirt Norfolk jackets. There were a number of ill-nourished-looking daughters, sensible and economical in their costume, the younger still with long, brown-stockinged legs, and the eldest present-there were, we discovered, one or two hidden away-displaying a large gold cross and other aggressive ecclesiastical symbols; there were two or three fox-terriers, a retrieverish mongrel, and an old, bloody-eyed and very evil-smelling St. Bernard. There was a jackdaw. There was, moreover, an ambiguous, silent lady that my aunt subsequently decided must be a very deaf paying guest. Two or three other people had concealed themselves at our coming and left unfinished teas behind them. Rugs and cushions lay among the chairs, and two of the latter were, I noted, covered with Union Jacks.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901522"><said direct=False>The vicar introduced us sketchily, and the faded Victorian wife regarded my aunt with a mixture of conventional scorn and abject respect, and talked to her in a languid, persistent voice about people in the neighbourhood whom my aunt could not possibly know.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901523"><said direct=False>My aunt received these personalia cheerfully, with her blue eyes flitting from point to point, and coming back again and again to the pinched faces of the daughters and the cross upon the eldest's breast. Encouraged by my aunt's manner, the vicar's wife grew patronising and kindly, and made it evident that she could do much to bridge the social gulf between ourselves and the people of family about us.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901524"><said direct=False>I had just snatches of that conversation. "Mrs. Merridew brought him quite a lot of money. Her father, I believe, had been in the Spanish wine trade-quite a lady though. And after that he fell off his horse and cracked his brain pan and took to fishing and farming. I'm sure you'll like to know them. He's most amusing.... The daughter had a disappointment and went to China as a missionary and got mixed up in a massacre."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901525"><said direct=True>"The most beautiful silks and things she brought back, you'</said><said direct=False>d hardly believe!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901526"><said direct=True>"Yes, they gave them to propitiate her. You see, they didn'</said><said direct=False>t understand the difference, and they thought that as they'd been massacring people, THEY'D be massacred. They didn't understand the difference Christianity makes."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901527"><said direct=True>"Seven bishops they'</said><said direct=False>ve had in the family!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901528"><said direct=True>"Married a Papist and was quite lost to them."</said><said direct=False>...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901529"><said direct=True>"He failed some dreadful examination and had to go into the militia."</said><said direct=False>...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901530"><said direct=True>"So she bit his leg as hard as ever she could and he let go."</said><said direct=False>...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901531"><said direct=True>"Had four of his ribs amputated."</said><said direct=False>...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901532"><said direct=False>"Caught meningitis and was carried off in a week."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901533"><said direct=True>"Had to have a large piece of silver tube let into his throat, and if he wants to talk he puts his finger on it. It makes him so interesting, I think. You feel he'</said><said direct=False>s sincere somehow. A most charming man in every way."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901534"><said direct=True>"Preserved them both in spirits very luckily, and there they are in his study, though of course he doesn'</said><said direct=False>t show them to everybody."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901535"><said direct=False>The silent lady, unperturbed by these apparently exciting topics, scrutinised my aunt's costume with a singular intensity, and was visibly moved when she unbuttoned her dust cloak and flung it wide. Meanwhile we men conversed, one of the more spirited daughters listened brightly, and the youths lay on the grass at our feet. My uncle offered them cigars, but they both declined,-out of bashfulness, it seemed to me, whereas the vicar, I think, accepted out of tact. When we were not looking at them directly, these young men would kick each other furtively.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901536"><said direct=False>Under the influence of my uncle's cigar, the vicar's mind had soared beyond the limits of the district. "This Socialism," he said, "seems making great headway."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901537"><said direct=False>My uncle shook his head. "We're too individualistic in this country for that sort of nonsense," he said "Everybody's business is nobody's business. That's where they go wrong."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901538"><said direct=True>"They have some intelligent people in their ranks, I am told,"</said><said direct=False> said the vicar, "writers and so forth. Quite a distinguished playwright, my eldest daughter was telling me-I forget his name.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901539"><said direct=True>"Milly, dear! Oh! she'</said><said direct=False>s not here. Painters, too, they have. This Socialist, it seems to me, is part of the Unrest of the Age.... But, as you say, the spirit of the people is against it. In the country, at any rate. The people down here are too sturdily independent in their small way-and too sensible altogether."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901540"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s a great thing for Duffield to have Lady Grove occupied again," he was saying when my wandering attention came back from some attractive casualty in his wife's discourse. "People have always looked up to the house and considering all things, old Mr. Durgan really was extraordinarily good-extraordinarily good. You intend to give us a good deal of your time here, I hope."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901541"><said direct=True>"I mean to do my duty by the Parish,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901542"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>m sincerely glad to hear it-sincerely. We've missed-the house influence. An English village isn't complete-People get out of hand. Life grows dull. The young people drift away to London."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901543"><said direct=False>He enjoyed his cigar gingerly for a moment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901544"><said direct=True>"We shall look to you to liven things up,"</said><said direct=False> he said, poor man!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901545"><said direct=False>My uncle cocked his cigar and removed it from his mouth.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901546"><said direct=True>"What you think the place wants?"</said><said direct=False> he asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901547"><said direct=False>He did not wait for an answer. "I been thinking while you been talking-things one might do. Cricket-a good English game-sports. Build the chaps a pavilion perhaps. Then every village ought to have a miniature rifle range."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901548"><said direct=True>"Ye-ees,"</said><said direct=False> said the vicar. "Provided, of course, there isn't a constant popping."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901549"><said direct=True>"Manage THAT all right,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle. "Thing'd be a sort of long shed. Paint it red. British colour. Then there's a Union Jack for the church and the village school. Paint the school red, too, p'raps. Not enough colour about now. Too grey. Then a maypole."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901550"><said direct=True>"How far our people would take up that sort of thing-"</said><said direct=False> began the vicar.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901551"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>m all for getting that good old English spirit back again," said my uncle. "Merrymakings. Lads and lasses dancing on the village green. Harvest home. Fairings. Yule Log-all the rest of it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901552"><said direct=True>"How would old Sally Glue do for a May Queen?"</said><said direct=False> asked one of the sons in the slight pause that followed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901553"><said direct=True>"Or Annie Glassbound?"</said><said direct=False> said the other, with the huge virile guffaw of a young man whose voice has only recently broken.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901554"><said direct=True>"Sally Glue is eighty-five,"</said><said direct=False> explained the vicar, "and Annie Glassbound is well-a young lady of extremely generous proportions. And not quite right, you know. Not quite right-here." He tapped his brow.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901555"><said direct=True>"Generous proportions!"</said><said direct=False> said the eldest son, and the guffaws were renewed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901556"><said direct=True>"You see,"</said><said direct=False> said the vicar, "all the brisker girls go into service in or near London. The life of excitement attracts them. And no doubt the higher wages have something to do with it. And the liberty to wear finery. And generally-freedom from restraint. So that there might be a little difficulty perhaps to find a May Queen here just at present who was really young and er-pretty.... Of course I couldn't think of any of my girls-or anything of that sort."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901557"><said direct=True>"We got to attract '</said><said direct=False>em back," said my uncle. "That's what I feel about it. We got to Buck-Up the country. The English country is a going concern still; just as the Established Church-if you'll excuse me saying it, is a going concern. Just as Oxford is-or Cambridge. Or any of those old, fine old things. Only it wants fresh capital, fresh idees and fresh methods. Light railways, f'rinstance-scientific use of drainage. Wire fencing machinery-all that."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901558"><said direct=False>The vicar's face for one moment betrayed dismay. Perhaps he was thinking of his country walks amids the hawthorns and honeysuckle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901559"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s great things," said my uncle, "to be done on Mod'un lines with Village Jam and Pickles-boiled in the country."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901560"><said direct=False>It was the reverberation of this last sentence in my mind, I think, that sharpened my sentimental sympathy as we went through the straggling village street and across the trim green on our way back to London. It seemed that afternoon the most tranquil and idyllic collection of creeper-sheltered homes you can imagine; thatch still lingered on a whitewashed cottage or two, pyracanthus, wall-flowers, and daffodils abounded, and an unsystematic orchard or so was white with blossom above and gay with bulbs below. I noted a row of straw beehives, beehive-shaped, beehives of the type long since condemned as inefficient by all progressive minds, and in the doctor's acre of grass a flock of two whole sheep was grazing,-no doubt he'd taken them on account. Two men and one old woman made gestures of abject vassalage, and my uncle replied with a lordly gesture of his great motoring glove....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901561"><said direct=True>"England'</said><said direct=False>s full of Bits like this," said my uncle, leaning over the front seat and looking back with great satisfaction. The black glare of his goggles rested for a time on the receding turrets of Lady Grove just peeping over the trees.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901562"><said direct=True>"I shall have a flagstaff, I think,"</said><said direct=False> he considered. "Then one could show when one is in residence. The villagers will like to know."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901563"><said direct=False>I reflected. "They will" I said. "They're used to liking to know."...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901564"><said direct=False>My aunt had been unusually silent. Suddenly she spoke. "He says Snap," she remarked; "he buys that place. And a nice old job of Housekeeping he gives me! He sails through the village swelling like an old turkey. And who'll have to scoot the butler? Me! Who's got to forget all she ever knew and start again? Me! Who's got to trek from Chiselhurst and be a great lady? Me! ... You old Bother! Just when I was settling down and beginning to feel at home."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901565"><said direct=False>My uncle turned his goggles to her. "Ah! THIS time it is home, Susan.... We got there."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901566"><said direct=False>It seems to me now but a step from the buying of Lady Grove to the beginning of Crest Hill, from the days when the former was a stupendous achievement to the days when it was too small and dark and inconvenient altogether for a great financier's use. For me that was a period of increasing detachment from our business and the great world of London; I saw it more and more in broken glimpses, and sometimes I was working in my little pavilion above Lady Grove for a fortnight together; even when I came up it was often solely for a meeting of the aeronautical society or for one of the learned societies or to consult literature or employ searchers or some such special business. For my uncle it was a period of stupendous inflation. Each time I met him I found him more confident, more comprehensive, more consciously a factor in great affairs. Soon he was no longer an associate of merely business men; he was big enough for the attentions of greater powers.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901567"><said direct=False>I grew used to discovering some item of personal news about him in my evening paper, or to the sight of a full-page portrait of him in a sixpenny magazine. Usually the news was of some munificent act, some romantic piece of buying or giving or some fresh rumour of reconstruction. He saved, you will remember, the Parbury Reynolds for the country. Or at times, it would be an interview or my uncle's contribution to some symposium on the "Secret of Success," or such-like topic. Or wonderful tales of his power of work, of his wonderful organisation to get things done, of his instant decisions and remarkable power of judging his fellow-men. They repeated his great mot: "Eight hour working day-I want eighty hours!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901568"><said direct=False>He became modestly but resolutely "public." They cartooned him in Vanity Fair. One year my aunt, looking indeed a very gracious, slender lady, faced the portrait of the King in the great room at Burlington House, and the next year saw a medallion of my uncle by Ewart, looking out upon the world, proud and imperial, but on the whole a trifle too prominently convex, from the walls of the New Gallery.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901569"><said direct=False>I shared only intermittently in his social experiences. People knew of me, it is true, and many of them sought to make through me a sort of flank attack upon him, and there was a legend, owing, very unreasonably, partly to my growing scientific reputation and partly to an element of reserve in my manner, that I played a much larger share in planning his operations than was actually the case. This led to one or two very intimate private dinners, to my inclusion in one or two house parties and various odd offers of introductions and services that I didn't for the most part accept. Among other people who sought me in this way was Archie Garvell, now a smart, impecunious soldier of no particular distinction, who would, I think, have been quite prepared to develop any sporting instincts I possessed, and who was beautifully unaware of our former contact. He was always offering me winners; no doubt in a spirit of anticipatory exchange for some really good thing in our more scientific and certain method of getting something for nothing....</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901570"><said direct=False>In spite of my preoccupation with my experiments, work, I did, I find now that I come to ransack my impressions, see a great deal of the great world during those eventful years; I had a near view of the machinery by which an astounding Empire is run, rubbed shoulders and exchanged experiences with bishops and statesmen, political women and women who were not political, physicians and soldiers, artists and authors, the directors of great journals, philanthropists and all sorts of eminent, significant people. I saw the statesmen without their orders and the bishops with but a little purple silk left over from their canonicals, inhaling, not incensen but cigar smoke. I could look at them all the better because, for the most part, they were not looking at me but at my uncle, and calculating consciously or unconsciously how they might use him and assimilate him to their system, the most unpremeditated, subtle, successful and aimless plutocracy that ever encumbered the destinies of mankind. Not one of them, so far as I could see, until disaster overtook him, resented his lies, his almost naked dishonesty of method, the disorderly disturbance of this trade and that, caused by his spasmodic operations. I can see them now about him, see them polite, watchful, various; his stiff compact little figure always a centre of attention, his wiry hair, his brief nose, his under-lip, electric with self-confidence. Wandering marginally through distinguished gatherings, I would catch the whispers: "That's Mr. Ponderevo!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901571"><said direct=False>"The little man?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901572"><said direct=False>"Yes, the little bounder with the glasses."</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901573"><said direct=True>"They say he'</said><said direct=False>s made-"...</said></p>
<p n="ENG190901574"><said direct=False>Or I would see him on some parterre of a platform beside my aunt's hurraying hat, amidst titles and costumes, "holding his end up," as he would say, subscribing heavily to obvious charities, even at times making brief convulsive speeches in some good cause before the most exalted audiences. "Mr. Chairman, your Royal Highness, my Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen," he would begin amidst subsiding applause and adjust those obstinate glasses and thrust back the wings of his frock-coat and rest his hands upon his hips and speak his fragment with ever and again an incidental Zzzz. His hands would fret about him as he spoke, fiddle his glasses, feel in his waistcoat pockets; ever and again he would rise slowly to his toes as a sentence unwound jerkily like a clockwork snake, and drop back on his heels at the end. They were the very gestures of our first encounter when he had stood before the empty fireplace in his minute draped parlour and talked of my future to my mother.</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG19090627"><said direct=True>"Love me?"</said><said direct=False> she said, struggling away from me, "Don't!" and then, as the train ran into a station, "You must tell no one.... I don't know.... You shouldn't have done that...."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090628"><said direct=False>Then two other people got in with us and terminated my wooing for a time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090629"><said direct=False>When we found ourselves alone together, walking towards Battersea, she had decided to be offended. I parted from her unforgiven and terribly distressed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090630"><said direct=False>When we met again, she told me I must never say "that" again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090631"><said direct=False>I had dreamt that to kiss her lips was ultimate satisfaction. But it was indeed only the beginning of desires. I told her my one ambition was to marry her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090632"><said direct=True>"But,"</said><said direct=False> she said, "you're not in a position-What's the good of talking like that?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090633"><said direct=False>I stared at her. "I mean to," I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090634"><said direct=True>"You can'</said><said direct=False>t," she answered. "It will be years"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090635"><said direct=True>"But I love you,"</said><said direct=False> I insisted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090636"><said direct=False>I stood not a yard from the sweet lips I had kissed; I stood within arm's length of the inanimate beauty I desired to quicken, and I saw opening between us a gulf of years, toil, waiting, disappointments and an immense uncertainty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090637"><said direct=True>"I love you,"</said><said direct=False> I said. "Don't you love me?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090638"><said direct=False>She looked me in the face with grave irresponsive eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090639"><said direct=True>"I don'</said><said direct=False>t know," she said. "I LIKE you, of course.... One has to be sensibl..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090640"><said direct=False>I can remember now my sense of frustration by her unresilient reply. I should have perceived then that for her my ardour had no quickening fire. But how was I to know? I had let myself come to want her, my imagination endowed her with infinite possibilities. I wanted her and wanted her, stupidly and instinctively....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090641"><said direct=True>"But,"</said><said direct=False> I said "Love-!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090642"><said direct=True>"One has to be sensible,"</said><said direct=False> she replied. "I like going about with you. Can't we keep as we are?'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090643"><said direct=False>Well, you begin to understand my breakdown now, I have been copious enough with these apologia. My work got more and more spiritless, my behaviour degenerated, my punctuality declined; I was more and more outclassed in the steady grind by my fellow-students. Such supplies of moral energy as I still had at command shaped now in the direction of serving Marion rather than science.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090644"><said direct=False>I fell away dreadfully, more and more I shirked and skulked; the humped men from the north, the pale men with thin, clenched minds, the intent, hard-breathing students I found against me, fell at last from keen rivalry to moral contempt. Even a girl got above me upon one of the lists. Then indeed I made it a point of honour to show by my public disregard of every rule that I really did not even pretend to try.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090645"><said direct=False>So one day I found myself sitting in a mood of considerable astonishment in Kensington Gardens, reacting on a recent heated interview with the school Registrar in which I had displayed more spirit than sense. I was astonished chiefly at my stupendous falling away from all the militant ideals of unflinching study I had brought up from Wimblehurst. I had displayed myself, as the Registrar put it, "an unmitigated rotter." My failure to get marks in the written examination had only been equalled by the insufficiency of my practical work.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090646"><said direct=True>"I ask you,"</said><said direct=False> the Registrar had said, "what will become of you when your scholarship runs out?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090647"><said direct=False>It certainly was an interesting question. What was going to become of me?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090648"><said direct=False>It was clear there would be nothing for me in the schools as I had once dared to hope; there seemed, indeed, scarcely anything in the world except an illpaid assistantship in some provincial organized Science School or grammar school. I knew that for that sort of work, without a degree or any qualification, one earned hardly a bare living and had little leisure to struggle up to anything better. If only I had even as little as fifty pounds I might hold out in London and take my B.Sc. degree, and quadruple my chances! My bitterness against my uncle returned at the thought. After all, he had some of my money still, or ought to have. Why shouldn't I act within my rights, threaten to 'take proceedings'? I meditated for a space on the idea, and then returned to the Science Library and wrote him a very considerable and occasionally pungent letter.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090649"><said direct=False>That letter to my uncle was the nadir of my failure. Its remarkable consequences, which ended my student days altogether, I will tell in the next chapter.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090650"><said direct=False>I say "my failure." Yet there are times when I can even doubt whether that period was a failure at all, when I become defensively critical of those exacting courses I did not follow, the encyclopaedic process of scientific exhaustion from which I was distracted. My mind was not inactive, even if it fed on forbidden food. I did not learn what my professors and demonstrators had resolved I should learn, but I learnt many things. My mind learnt to swing wide and to swing by itself.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090651"><said direct=False>After all, those other fellows who took high places in the College examinations and were the professor's model boys haven't done so amazingly. Some are professors themselves, some technical experts; not one can show things done such as I, following my own interest, have achieved. For I have built boats that smack across the water like whiplashes; no one ever dreamt of such boats until I built them; and I have surprised three secrets that are more than technical discoveries, in the unexpected hiding-places of Nature. I have come nearer flying than any man has done. Could I have done as much if I had had a turn for obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college who proposed to train my mind? If I had been trained in research-that ridiculous contradiction in terms-should I have done more than produce additions to the existing store of little papers with blunted conclusions, of which there are already too many? I see no sense in mock modesty upon this matter. Even by the standards of worldly success I am, by the side of my fellow-students, no failure. I had my F.R.S. by the time I was thirty-seven, and if I am not very wealthy poverty is as far from me as the Spanish Inquisition. Suppose I had stamped down on the head of my wandering curiosity, locked my imagination in a box just when it wanted to grow out to things, worked by so-and-so's excellent method and so-and-so's indications, where should I be now?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090652"><said direct=False>I may be all wrong in this. It may be I should be a far more efficient man than I am if I had cut off all those divergent expenditures of energy, plugged up my curiosity about society with more currently acceptable rubbish or other, abandoned Ewart, evaded Marion instead of pursuing her, concentrated. But I don't believe it!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090653"><said direct=False>However, I certainly believed it completely and was filled with remorse on that afternoon when I sat dejectedly in Kensington Gardens and reviewed, in the light of the Registrar's pertinent questions my first two years in London.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090654"><said direct=False>Throughout my student days I had not seen my uncle. I refrained from going to him in spite of an occasional regret that in this way I estranged myself from my aunt Susan, and I maintained a sulky attitude of mind towards him. And I don't think that once in all that time I gave a thought to that mystic word of his that was to alter all the world for us. Yet I had not altogether forgotten it. It was with a touch of memory, dim transient perplexity if no more-why did this thing seem in some way personal?-that I read a new inscription upon the hoardings:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090655"><said direct=False>THE SECRET OF VIGOUR, TONO-BUNGAY.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090656"><said direct=False>That was all. It was simple and yet in some way arresting. I found myself repeating the word after I had passed; it roused one's attention like the sound of distant guns. "Tono"-what's that? and deep, rich, unhurrying;-"BUN-gay!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090657"><said direct=False>Then came my uncle's amazing telegram, his answer to my hostile note: "Come to me at once you are wanted three hundred a year certain tono-bungay."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090658"><said direct=True>"By Jove!"</said><said direct=False> I cried, "of course!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090659"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s something-. A patent-medicine! I wonder what he wants with me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090660"><said direct=False>In his Napoleonic way my uncle had omitted to give an address. His telegram had been handed in at Farringdon Road, and after complex meditations I replied to Ponderevo, Farringdon Road, trusting to the rarity of our surname to reach him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090661"><said direct=True>"Where are you?"</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090662"><said direct=False>His reply came promptly:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090663"><said direct=False>"192A, Raggett Street, E.C."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090664"><said direct=False>The next day I took an unsanctioned holiday after the morning's lecture. I discovered my uncle in a wonderfully new silk hat-oh, a splendid hat! with a rolling brim that went beyond the common fashion. It was decidedly too big for him-that was its only fault. It was stuck on the back of his head, and he was in a white waistcoat and shirt sleeves. He welcomed me with a forgetfulness of my bitter satire and my hostile abstinence that was almost divine. His glasses fell off at the sight of me. His round inexpressive eyes shone brightly. He held out his plump short hand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090665"><said direct=True>"Here we are, George! What did I tell you? Needn'</said><said direct=False>t whisper it now, my boy. Shout it-LOUD! spread it about! Tell every one! Tono-TONO-, TONO-BUNGAY!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090666"><said direct=False>Raggett Street, you must understand, was a thoroughfare over which some one had distributed large quantities of cabbage stumps and leaves. It opened out of the upper end of Farringdon Street, and 192A was a shop with the plate-glass front coloured chocolate, on which several of the same bills I had read upon the hoardings had been stuck. The floor was covered by street mud that had been brought in on dirty boots, and three energetic young men of the hooligan type, in neck-wraps and caps, were packing wooden cases with papered-up bottles, amidst much straw and confusion. The counter was littered with these same swathed bottles, of a pattern then novel but now amazingly familiar in the world, the blue paper with the coruscating figure of a genially nude giant, and the printed directions of how under practically all circumstances to take Tono-Bungay. Beyond the counter on one side opened a staircase down which I seem to remember a girl descending with a further consignment of bottles, and the rest of the background was a high partition, also chocolate, with "Temporary Laboratory" inscribed upon it in white letters, and over a door that pierced it, "Office." Here I rapped, inaudible amid much hammering, and then entered unanswered to find my uncle, dressed as I have described, one hand gripping a sheath of letters, and the other scratching his head as he dictated to one of three toiling typewriter girls. Behind him was a further partition and a door inscribed "ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE-NO ADMISSION," thereon. This partition was of wood painted the universal chocolate, up to about eight feet from the ground, and then of glass. Through the glass I saw dimly a crowded suggestion of crucibles and glass retorts, and-by Jove!-yes!-the dear old Wimblehurst air-pump still! It gave me quite a little thrill-that air-pump! And beside it was the electrical machine-but something-some serious trouble-had happened to that. All these were evidently placed on a shelf just at the level to show.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090667"><said direct=True>"Come right into the sanctum,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, after he had finished something about "esteemed consideration," and whisked me through the door into a room that quite amazingly failed to verify the promise of that apparatus. It was papered with dingy wall-paper that had peeled in places; it contained a fireplace, an easy-chair with a cushion, a table on which stood two or three big bottles, a number of cigar-boxes on the mantel, whisky Tantalus and a row of soda syphons. He shut the door after me carefully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090668"><said direct=True>"Well, here we are!"</said><said direct=False> he said. "Going strong! Have a whisky, George? No!-Wise man! Neither will I! You see me at it! At it-hard!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090669"><said direct=False>"Hard at what?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090670"><said direct=True>"Read it,"</said><said direct=False> and he thrust into my hand a label-that label that has now become one of the most familiar objects of the chemist's shop, the greenish-blue rather old-fashioned bordering, the legend, the name in good black type, very clear, and the strong man all set about with lightning flashes above the double column of skilful lies in red-the label of Tono-Bungay. "It's afloat," he said, as I stood puzzling at this. "It's afloat. I'm afloat!" And suddenly he burst out singing in that throaty tenor of his-</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090671"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>m afloat, I'm afloat on the fierce flowing tide, The ocean's my home and my bark is my bride!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090672"><said direct=True>"Ripping song that is, George. Not so much a bark as a solution, but still-it does! Here we are at it! By-the-by! Half a mo'</said><said direct=False>! I've thought of a thing." He whisked out, leaving me to examine this nuclear spot at leisure while his voice became dictatorial without. The den struck me as in its large grey dirty way quite unprecedented and extraordinary. The bottles were all labelled simply A, B, C, and so forth, and that dear old apparatus above, seen from this side, was even more patiently "on the shelf" than when it had been used to impress Wimblehurst. I saw nothing for it but to sit down in the chair and await my uncle's explanations. I remarked a frock-coat with satin lapels behind the door; there was a dignified umbrella in the corner and a clothes-brush and a hat-brush stood on a side-table. My uncle returned in five minutes looking at his watch-a gold watch-"Gettin' lunch-time, George," he said. "You'd better come and have lunch with me!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090673"><said direct=True>"How'</said><said direct=False>s Aunt Susan?" I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090674"><said direct=False>"Exuberant. Never saw her so larky. This has bucked her up something wonderful-all this."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090675"><said direct=False>"All what?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090676"><said direct=False>"Tono-Bungay."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090677"><said direct=True>"What is Tono-Bungay?"</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090678"><said direct=False>My uncle hesitated. "Tell you after lunch, George," he said. "Come along!" and having locked up the sanctum after himself, led the way along a narrow dirty pavement, lined with barrows and swept at times by avalanche-like porters bearing burthens to vans, to Farringdon Street. He hailed a passing cab superbly, and the cabman was infinitely respectful. "Schafer's," he said, and off we went side by side-and with me more and more amazed at all these things-to Schafer's Hotel, the second of the two big places with huge lace curtain-covered windows, near the corner of Blackfriars Bridge.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090679"><said direct=False>I will confess I felt a magic charm in our relative proportions as the two colossal, pale-blue-and-red liveried porters of Schafers' held open the inner doors for us with a respectful salutation that in some manner they seemed to confine wholly to my uncle. Instead of being about four inches taller, I felt at least the same size as he, and very much slenderer. Still more respectful-waiters relieved him of the new hat and the dignified umbrella, and took his orders for our lunch. He gave them with a fine assurance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090680"><said direct=False>He nodded to several of the waiters.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090681"><said direct=True>"They know me, George, already,"</said><said direct=False> he said. "Point me out. Live place! Eye for coming men!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090682"><said direct=False>The detailed business of the lunch engaged our attention for a while, and then I leant across my plate. "And NOW?" said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090683"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s the secret of vigour. Didn't you read that label?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090684"><said direct=False>"Yes, but-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090685"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s selling like hot cakes."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090686"><said direct=True>"And what is it?"</said><said direct=False> I pressed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090687"><said direct=True>"Well,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, and then leant forward and spoke softly under cover of his hand, "It's nothing more or less than..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090688"><said direct=False>(But here an unfortunate scruple intervenes. After all, Tono-Bungay is still a marketable commodity and in the hands of purchasers, who bought it from-among other vendors-me. No! I am afraid I cannot give it away-)</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090689"><said direct=True>"You see,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle in a slow confidential whisper, with eyes very wide and a creased forehead, "it's nice because of the" (here he mentioned a flavouring matter and an aromatic spirit), "it's stimulating because of" (here he mentioned two very vivid tonics, one with a marked action on the kidney.) "And the" (here he mentioned two other ingredients) "makes it pretty intoxicating. Cocks their tails. Then there's" (but I touch on the essential secret.) "And there you are. I got it out of an old book of recipes-all except the" (here he mentioned the more virulent substance, the one that assails the kidneys), "which is my idea! Modern touch! There you are!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090690"><said direct=False>He reverted to the direction of our lunch.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090691"><said direct=False>Presently he was leading the way to the lounge-sumptuous piece in red morocco and yellow glazed crockery, with incredible vistas of settees and sofas and things, and there I found myself grouped with him in two excessively upholstered chairs with an earthenware Moorish table between us bearing coffee and Benedictine, and I was tasting the delights of a tenpenny cigar. My uncle smoked a similar cigar in an habituated manner, and he looked energetic and knowing and luxurious and most unexpectedly a little bounder, round the end of it. It was just a trivial flaw upon our swagger, perhaps that we both were clear our cigars had to be "mild." He got obliquely across the spaces of his great armchair so as to incline confidentially to my ear, he curled up his little legs, and I, in my longer way, adopted a corresponding receptive obliquity. I felt that we should strike an unbiased observer as a couple of very deep and wily and developing and repulsive persons.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090692"><said direct=True>"I want to let you into this"</said><said direct=False>-puff-"George," said my uncle round the end of his cigar. "For many reasons."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090693"><said direct=False>His voice grew lower and more cunning. He made explanations that to my inexperience did not completely explain. I retain an impression of a long credit and a share with a firm of wholesale chemists, of a credit and a prospective share with some pirate printers, of a third share for a leading magazine and newspaper proprietor.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090694"><said direct=True>"I played '</said><said direct=False>em off one against the other," said my uncle. I took his point in an instant. He had gone to each of them in turn and said the others had come in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090695"><said direct=True>"I put up four hundred pounds,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, "myself and my all. And you know-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090696"><said direct=False>He assumed a brisk confidence. "I hadn't five hundred pence. At least-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090697"><said direct=False>For a moment he really was just a little embarrassed. "I DID" he said, "produce capital. You see, there was that trust affair of yours-I ought, I suppose-in strict legality-to have put that straight first. Zzzz....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090698"><said direct=True>"It was a bold thing to do,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, shifting the venue from the region of honour to the region of courage. And then with a characteristic outburst of piety, "Thank God it's all come right!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090699"><said direct=True>"And now, I suppose, you ask where do YOU come in? Well, fact is I'</said><said direct=False>ve always believed in you, George. You've got-it's a sort of dismal grit. Bark your shins, rouse you, and you'll go! You'd rush any position you had a mind to rush. I know a bit about character, George-trust me. You've got-" He clenched his hands and thrust them out suddenly, and at the same time said, with explosive violence, "Wooosh! Yes. You have! The way you put away that Latin at Wimblehurst; I've never forgotten it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090700"><said direct=True>"Wo-oo-oo-osh! Your science and all that! Wo-oo-oo-osh! I know my limitations. There'</said><said direct=False>s things I can do, and" (he spoke in a whisper, as though this was the first hint of his life's secret) "there's things I can't. Well, I can create this business, but I can't make it go. I'm too voluminous-I'm a boiler-over, not a simmering stick-at-it. You keep on HOTTING UP AND HOTTING UP. Papin's digester. That's you, steady and long and piling up,-then, wo-oo-oo-oo-osh. Come in and stiffen these niggers. Teach them that wo-oo-oo-oo-osh. There you are! That's what I'm after. You! Nobody else believes you're more than a boy. Come right in with me and be a man. Eh, George? Think of the fun of it-a thing on the go-a Real Live Thing! Wooshing it up! Making it buzz and spin! Whoo-oo-oo."-He made alluring expanding circles in the air with his hand. "Eh?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090701"><said direct=False>His proposal, sinking to confidential undertones again, took more definite shape. I was to give all my time and energy to developing and organising. "You shan't write a single advertisement, or give a single assurance" he declared. "I can do all that." And the telegram was no flourish; I was to have three hundred a year. Three hundred a year. ("That's nothing," said my uncle, "the thing to freeze on to, when the time comes, is your tenth of the vendor's share.")</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090702"><said direct=False>Three hundred a year certain, anyhow! It was an enormous income to me. For a moment I was altogether staggered. Could there be that much money in the whole concern? I looked about me at the sumptuous furniture of Schafer's Hotel. No doubt there were many such incomes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090703"><said direct=False>My head was spinning with unwonted Benedictine and Burgundy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090704"><said direct=True>"Let me go back and look at the game again,"</said><said direct=False> I said. "Let me see upstairs and round about."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090705"><said direct=False>I did.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090706"><said direct=True>"What do you think of it all?"</said><said direct=False> my uncle asked at last.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090707"><said direct=True>"Well, for one thing,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "why don't you have those girls working in a decently ventilated room? Apart from any other consideration, they'd work twice as briskly. And they ought to cover the corks before labelling round the bottle."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090708"><said direct=True>"Why?"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090709"><said direct=True>"Because-they sometimes make a mucker of the cork job, and then the label'</said><said direct=False>s wasted."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090710"><said direct=True>"Come and change it, George,"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle, with sudden fervour "Come here and make a machine of it. You can. Make it all slick, and then make it woosh. I know you can. Oh! I know you can."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090711"><said direct=False>I seem to remember very quick changes of mind after that lunch. The muzzy exaltation of the unaccustomed stimulants gave way very rapidly to a model of pellucid and impartial clairvoyance which is one of my habitual mental states. It is intermittent; it leaves me for weeks together, I know, but back it comes at last like justice on circuit, and calls up all my impression, all my illusions, all my willful and passionate proceedings. We came downstairs again into that inner room which pretended to be a scientific laboratory through its high glass lights, and indeed was a lurking place. My uncle pressed a cigarette on me, and I took it and stood before the empty fireplace while he propped his umbrella in the corner, deposited the new silk hat that was a little too big for him on the table, blew copiously and produced a second cigar.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090712"><said direct=False>It came into my head that he had shrunken very much in size since the Wimblehurst days, that the cannon ball he had swallowed was rather more evident and shameless than it had been, his skin less fresh and the nose between his glasses, which still didn't quite fit, much redder. And just then he seemed much laxer in his muscles and not quite as alertly quick in his movements. But he evidently wasn't aware of the degenerative nature of his changes as he sat there, looking suddenly quite little under my eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090713"><said direct=True>"Well, George!"</said><said direct=False> he said, quite happily unconscious of my silent criticism, "what do you think of it all?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090714"><said direct=True>"Well,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "in the first place-it's a damned swindle!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090715"><said direct=True>"Tut! tut!"</said><said direct=False> said my uncle. "It's as straight as-It's fair trading!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090716"><said direct=True>"So much the worse for trading,"</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090717"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s the sort of thing everybody does. After all, there's no harm in the stuff-and it may do good. It might do a lot of good-giving people confidence, f'rinstance, against an epidemic. See? Why not? don't see where your swindle comes in."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090718"><said direct=True>"H'</said><said direct=False>m," I said. "It's a thing you either see or don't see."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090719"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>d like to know what sort of trading isn't a swindle in its way. Everybody who does a large advertised trade is selling something common on the strength of saying it's uncommon. Look at Chickson-they made him a baronet. Look at Lord Radmore, who did it on lying about the alkali in soap! Rippin' ads those were of his too!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090720"><said direct=True>"You don'</said><said direct=False>t mean to say you think doing this stuff up in bottles and swearing it's the quintessence of strength and making poor devils buy it at that, is straight?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090721"><said direct=True>"Why not, George? How do we know it mayn'</said><said direct=False>t be the quintessence to them so far as they're concerned?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090722"><said direct=True>"Oh!"</said><said direct=False> I said, and shrugged my shoulders.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090723"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s Faith. You put Faith in 'em.... I grant our labels are a bit emphatic. Christian Science, really. No good setting people against the medicine. Tell me a solitary trade nowadays that hasn't to be-emphatic. It's the modern way! Everybody understands it-everybody allows for it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090724"><said direct=False>"But the world would be no worse and rather better, if all this stuff of yours was run down a conduit into the Thames."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090725"><said direct=True>"Don'</said><said direct=False>t see that, George, at all. 'Mong other things, all our people would be out of work. Unemployed! I grant you Tono-Bungay MAY be-not QUITE so good a find for the world as Peruvian bark, but the point is, George-it MAKES TRADE! And the world lives on trade. Commerce! A romantic exchange of commodities and property. Romance. 'Magination. See? You must look at these things in a broad light. Look at the wood-and forget the trees! And hang it, George! we got to do these things! There's no way unless you do. What do YOU mean to do-anyhow?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090726"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s ways of living," I said, "Without either fraud or lying."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090727"><said direct=True>"You'</said><said direct=False>re a bit stiff, George. There's no fraud in this affair, I'll bet my hat. But what do you propose to do? Go as chemist to some one who IS running a business, and draw a salary without a share like I offer you. Much sense in that! It comes out of the swindle as you call it-just the same."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090728"><said direct=True>"Some businesses are straight and quiet, anyhow; supply a sound article that is really needed, don'</said><said direct=False>t shout advertisements."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090729"><said direct=True>"No, George. There you'</said><said direct=False>re behind the times. The last of that sort was sold up 'bout five years ago."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090730"><said direct=True>"Well, there'</said><said direct=False>s scientific research."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090731"><said direct=True>"And who pays for that? Who put up that big City and Guilds place at South Kensington? Enterprising business men! They fancy they'</said><said direct=False>ll have a bit of science going on, they want a handy Expert ever and again, and there you are! And what do you get for research when you've done it? Just a bare living and no outlook. They just keep you to make discoveries, and if they fancy they'll use 'em they do."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090732"><said direct=False>"One can teach."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090733"><said direct=True>"How much a year, George? How much a year? I suppose you must respect Carlyle! Well, you take Carlyle'</said><said direct=False>s test-solvency. (Lord! what a book that French Revolution of his is!) See what the world pays teachers and discoverers and what it pays business men! That shows the ones it really wants. There's a justice in these big things, George, over and above the apparent injustice. I tell you it wants trade. It's Trade that makes the world go round! Argosies! Venice! Empire!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090734"><said direct=False>My uncle suddenly rose to his feet.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090735"><said direct=True>"You think it over, George. You think it over! And come up on Sunday to the new place-we got rooms in Gower Street now-and see your aunt. She'</said><said direct=False>s often asked for you, George often and often, and thrown it up at me about that bit of property-though I've always said and always will, that twenty-five shillings in the pound is what I'll pay you and interest up to the nail. And think it over. It isn't me I ask you to help. It's yourself. It's your aunt Susan. It's the whole concern. It's the commerce of your country. And we want you badly. I tell you straight, I know my limitations. You could take this place, you could make it go! I can see you at it-looking rather sour. Woosh is the word, George."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090736"><said direct=False>And he smiled endearingly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090737"><said direct=True>"I got to dictate a letter,"</said><said direct=False> he said, ending the smile, and vanished into the outer room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090738"><said direct=False>I didn't succumb without a struggle to my uncle's allurements. Indeed, I held out for a week while I contemplated life and my prospects. It was a crowded and muddled contemplation. It invaded even my sleep.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090739"><said direct=False>My interview with the Registrar, my talk with my uncle, my abrupt discovery of the hopeless futility of my passion for Marion, had combined to bring me to sense of crisis. What was I going to do with life?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090740"><said direct=False>I remember certain phases of my indecisions very well.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090741"><said direct=False>I remember going home from our talk. I went down Farringdon Street to the Embankment because I thought to go home by Holborn and Oxford Street would be too crowded for thinking.... That piece of Embankment from Blackfriars to Westminster still reminds me of that momentous hesitation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090742"><said direct=False>You know, from first to last, I saw the business with my eyes open, I saw its ethical and moral values quite clearly. Never for a moment do I remember myself faltering from my persuasion that the sale of Tono-Bungay was a thoroughly dishonest proceeding. The stuff was, I perceived, a mischievous trash, slightly stimulating, aromatic and attractive, likely to become a bad habit and train people in the habitual use of stronger tonics and insidiously dangerous to people with defective kidneys. It would cost about sevenpence the large bottle to make, including bottling, and we were to sell it at half a crown plus the cost of the patent medicine stamp. A thing that I will confess deterred me from the outset far more than the sense of dishonesty in this affair, was the supreme silliness of the whole concern. I still clung to the idea that the world of men was or should be a sane and just organisation, and the idea that I should set myself gravely, just at the fine springtime of my life, to developing a monstrous bottling and packing warehouse, bottling rubbish for the consumption of foolish, credulous and depressed people, had in it a touch of insanity. My early beliefs still clung to me. I felt assured that somewhere there must be a hitch in the fine prospect of ease and wealth under such conditions; that somewhere, a little overgrown, perhaps, but still traceable, lay a neglected, wasted path of use and honour for me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090743"><said direct=False>My inclination to refuse the whole thing increased rather than diminished at first as I went along the Embankment. In my uncle's presence there had been a sort of glamour that had prevented an outright refusal. It was a revival of affection for him I felt in his presence, I think, in part, and in part an instinctive feeling that I must consider him as my host. But much more was it a curious persuasion he had the knack of inspiring-a persuasion not so much of his integrity and capacity as of the reciprocal and yielding foolishness of the world. One felt that he was silly and wild, but in some way silly and wild after the fashion of the universe. After all, one must live somehow. I astonished him and myself by temporising.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090744"><said direct=True>"No,"</said><said direct=False> said I, "I'll think it over!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090745"><said direct=False>And as I went along the embankment the first effect was all against my uncle. He shrank-for a little while he continued to shrink-in perspective until he was only a very small shabby little man in a dirty back street, sending off a few hundred bottles of rubbish to foolish buyers. The great buildings on the right of us, the Inns and the School Board place-as it was then-Somerset House, the big hotels, the great bridges, Westminster's outlines ahead, had an effect of grey largeness that reduced him to the proportions of a busy black beetle in a crack in the floor.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090746"><said direct=False>And then my eye caught the advertisements on the south side of "Sorber's Food," of "Cracknell's Ferric Wine," very bright and prosperous signs, illuminated at night, and I realised how astonishingly they looked at home there, how evidently part they were in the whole thing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090747"><said direct=False>I saw a man come charging out of Palace Yard-the policeman touched his helmet to him-with a hat and a bearing astonishingly like my uncle's. After all,-didn't Cracknell himself sit in the House?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090748"><said direct=False>Tono-Bungay shouted at me from a hoarding near Adelphi Terrace; I saw it afar off near Carfax Street; it cried out again upon me in Kensington High Street, and burst into a perfect clamour; six or seven times I saw it as I drew near my diggings. It certainly had an air of being something more than a dream.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090749"><said direct=False>Yes, I thought it over-thoroughly enough.... Trade rules the world. Wealth rather than trade! The thing was true, and true too was my uncle's proposition that the quickest way to get wealth is to sell the cheapest thing possible in the dearest bottle. He was frightfully right after all. Pecunnia non olet,-a Roman emperor said that. Perhaps my great heroes in Plutarch were no more than such men, fine now only because they are distant; perhaps after all this Socialism to which I had been drawn was only a foolish dream, only the more foolish because all its promises were conditionally true. Morris and these others played with it wittingly; it gave a zest, a touch of substance, to their aesthetic pleasures. Never would there be good faith enough to bring such things about. They knew it; every one, except a few young fools, knew it. As I crossed the corner of St. James's Park wrapped in thought, I dodged back just in time to escape a prancing pair of greys. A stout, common-looking woman, very magnificently dressed, regarded me from the carriage with a scornful eye. "No doubt," thought I, "a pill-vendor's wife...."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090750"><said direct=False>Running through all my thoughts, surging out like a refrain, was my uncle's master-stroke, his admirable touch of praise: "Make it all slick-and then make it go Woosh. I know you can! Oh! I KNOW you can!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090751"><said direct=False>Ewart as a moral influence was unsatisfactory. I had made up my mind to put the whole thing before him, partly to see how he took it, and partly to hear how it sounded when it was said. I asked him to come and eat with me in an Italian place near Panton Street where one could get a curious, interesting, glutting sort of dinner for eighteen-pence. He came with a disconcerting black-eye that he wouldn't explain. "Not so much a black-eye," he said, "as the aftermath of a purple patch.... What's your difficulty?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090752"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>ll tell you with the salad," I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090753"><said direct=False>But as a matter of fact I didn't tell him. I threw out that I was doubtful whether I ought to go into trade, or stick to teaching in view of my deepening socialist proclivities; and he, warming with the unaccustomed generosity of a sixteen-penny Chianti, ran on from that without any further inquiry as to my trouble.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090754"><said direct=False>His utterances roved wide and loose.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090755"><said direct=True>"The reality of life, my dear Ponderevo,"</said><said direct=False> I remember him saying very impressively and punctuating with the nut-crackers as he spoke, "is Chromatic Conflict ... and Form. Get hold of that and let all these other questions go. The Socialist will tell you one sort of colour and shape is right, the Individualist another. What does it all amount to? What DOES it all amount to? NOTHING! I have no advice to give anyone,-except to avoid regrets. Be yourself, seek after such beautiful things as your own sense determines to be beautiful. And don't mind the headache in the morning.... For what, after all, is a morning, Ponderevo? It isn't like the upper part of a day!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090756"><said direct=False>He paused impressively.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090757"><said direct=True>"What Rot!"</said><said direct=False> I cried, after a confused attempt to apprehend him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090758"><said direct=True>"Isn'</said><said direct=False>t it! And it's my bedrock wisdom in the matter! Take it or leave it, my dear George; take it or leave it."... He put down the nut-crackers out of my reach and lugged a greasy-looking note-book from his pocket. "I'm going to steal this mustard pot," he said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090759"><said direct=False>I made noises of remonstrance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090760"><said direct=True>"Only as a matter of design. I'</said><said direct=False>ve got to do an old beast's tomb.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090761"><said direct=True>"Wholesale grocer. I'</said><said direct=False>ll put it on his corners,-four mustard pots. I dare say he'd be glad of a mustard plaster now to cool him, poor devil, where he is. But anyhow,-here goes!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090762"><said direct=False>It came to me in the small hours that the real moral touchstone for this great doubting of mind was Marion. I lay composing statements of my problem and imagined myself delivering them to her-and she, goddess-like and beautiful; giving her fine, simply-worded judgment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090763"><said direct=True>"You see, it'</said><said direct=False>s just to give one's self over to the Capitalistic System," I imagined myself saying in good Socialist jargon; "it's surrendering all one's beliefs. We MAY succeed, we MAY grow rich, but where would the satisfaction be?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090764"><said direct=False>Then she would say, "No! That wouldn't be right."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090765"><said direct=False>"But the alternative is to wait!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090766"><said direct=False>Then suddenly she would become a goddess. She would turn upon me frankly and nobly, with shining eyes, with arms held out. "No," she would say, "we love one another. Nothing ignoble shall ever touch us. We love one another. Why wait to tell each other that, dear? What does it matter that we are poor and may keep poor?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090767"><said direct=False>But indeed the conversation didn't go at all in that direction. At the sight of her my nocturnal eloquence became preposterous and all the moral values altered altogether. I had waited for her outside the door of the Parsian-robe establishment in Kensington High Street and walked home with her thence. I remember how she emerged into the warm evening light and that she wore a brown straw hat that made her, for once not only beautiful but pretty.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090768"><said direct=True>"I like that hat,"</said><said direct=False> I said by way of opening; and she smiled her rare delightful smile at me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090769"><said direct=True>"I love you,"</said><said direct=False> I said in an undertone, as we jostled closer on the pavement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090770"><said direct=False>She shook her head forbiddingly, but she still smiled. Then-"Be sensible!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090771"><said direct=False>The High Street pavement is too narrow and crowded for conversation and we were some way westward before we spoke again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090772"><said direct=True>"Look here,"</said><said direct=False> I said; "I want you, Marion. Don't you understand? I want you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090773"><said direct=True>"Now!"</said><said direct=False> she cried warningly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090774"><said direct=False>I do not know if the reader will understand how a passionate lover, an immense admiration and desire, can be shot with a gleam of positive hatred. Such a gleam there was in me at the serene self-complacency of that "NOW!" It vanished almost before I felt it. I found no warning in it of the antagonisms latent between us.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090775"><said direct=True>"Marion,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "this isn't a trifling matter to me. I love you; I would die to get you.... Don't you care?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090776"><said direct=False>"But what is the good?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090777"><said direct=True>"You don'</said><said direct=False>t care," I cried. "You don't care a rap!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090778"><said direct=True>"You know I care,"</said><said direct=False> she answered. "If I didn't-If I didn't like you very much, should I let you come and meet me-go about with you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090779"><said direct=True>"Well then,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "promise to marry me!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090780"><said direct=False>"If I do, what difference will it make?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090781"><said direct=False>We were separated by two men carrying a ladder who drove between us unawares.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090782"><said direct=True>"Marion,"</said><said direct=False> I asked when we got together again, "I tell you I want you to marry me."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090783"><said direct=True>"We can'</said><said direct=False>t."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090784"><said direct=False>"Why not?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090785"><said direct=True>"We can'</said><said direct=False>t marry-in the street."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090786"><said direct=False>"We could take our chance!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090787"><said direct=True>"I wish you wouldn'</said><said direct=False>t go on talking like this. What is the good?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090788"><said direct=False>She suddenly gave way to gloom. "It's no good marrying" she said. "One's only miserable. I've seen other girls. When one's alone one has a little pocket-money anyhow, one can go about a little. But think of being married and no money, and perhaps children-you can't be sure...."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090789"><said direct=False>She poured out this concentrated philosophy of her class and type in jerky uncompleted sentences, with knitted brows, with discontented eyes towards the westward glow-forgetful, it seemed, for a moment even of me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090790"><said direct=True>"Look here, Marion,"</said><said direct=False> I said abruptly, "what would you marry on?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090791"><said direct=True>"What IS the good?"</said><said direct=False> she began.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090792"><said direct=False>"Would you marry on three hundred a year?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090793"><said direct=False>She looked at me for a moment. "That's six pounds a week," she said. "One could manage on that, easily. Smithie's brother-No, he only gets two hundred and fifty. He married a typewriting girl."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090794"><said direct=False>"Will you marry me if I get three hundred a year?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090795"><said direct=False>She looked at me again, with a curious gleam of hope.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090796"><said direct=True>"IF!"</said><said direct=False> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090797"><said direct=False>I held out my hand and looked her in the eyes. "It's a bargain," I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090798"><said direct=False>She hesitated and touched my hand for an instant. "It's silly," she remarked as she did so. "It means really we're-" She paused.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090799"><said direct=True>"Yes?"</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090800"><said direct=True>"Engaged. You'</said><said direct=False>ll have to wait years. What good can it do you?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090801"><said direct=True>"Not so many years."</said><said direct=False> I answered.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090802"><said direct=False>For a moment she brooded.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090803"><said direct=False>Then she glanced at me with a smile, half-sweet, half-wistful, that has stuck in my memory for ever.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090804"><said direct=True>"I like you!"</said><said direct=False> she said. "I shall like to be engaged to you."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090805"><said direct=False>And, faint on the threshold of hearing, I caught her ventured "dear!" It's odd that in writing this down my memory passed over all that intervened and I feel it all again, and once again I'm Marion's boyish lover taking great joy in such rare and little things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090806"><said direct=False>At last I went to the address my uncle had given me in Gower Street, and found my aunt Susan waiting tea for him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090807"><said direct=False>Directly I came into the room I appreciated the change in outlook that the achievement of Tono-Bungay had made almost as vividly as when I saw my uncle's new hat. The furniture of the room struck upon my eye as almost stately. The chairs and sofa were covered with chintz which gave it a dim, remote flavour of Bladesover; the mantel, the cornice, the gas pendant were larger and finer than the sort of thing I had grown accustomed to in London. And I was shown in by a real housemaid with real tails to her cap, and great quantities of reddish hair. There was my aunt too looking bright and pretty, in a blue-patterned tea-wrap with bows that seemed to me the quintessence of fashion. She was sitting in a chair by the open window with quite a pile of yellow-labelled books on the occasional table beside her. Before the large, paper-decorated fireplace stood a three-tiered cake-stand displaying assorted cakes, and a tray with all the tea equipage except the teapot, was on the large centre-table. The carpet was thick, and a spice of adventure was given it by a number of dyed sheep-skin mats.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090808"><said direct=True>"Hello!"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt as I appeared. "It's George!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090809"><said direct=True>"Shall I serve the tea now, Mem?"</said><said direct=False> said the real housemaid, surveying our greeting coldly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090810"><said direct=True>"Not till Mr. Ponderevo comes, Meggie,"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt, and grimaced with extraordinary swiftness and virulence as the housemaid turned her back.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090811"><said direct=True>"Meggie she calls herself,"</said><said direct=False> said my aunt as the door closed, and left me to infer a certain want of sympathy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090812"><said direct=True>"You'</said><said direct=False>re looking very jolly, aunt," said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090813"><said direct=True>"What do you think of all this old Business he'</said><said direct=False>s got?" asked my aunt.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090814"><said direct=True>"Seems a promising thing,"</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090815"><said direct=False>"I suppose there is a business somewhere?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090816"><said direct=True>"Haven'</said><said direct=False>t you seen it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090817"><said direct=True>"'</said><said direct=False>Fraid I'd say something AT it George, if I did. So he won't let me. It came on quite suddenly. Brooding he was and writing letters and sizzling something awful-like a chestnut going to pop. Then he came home one day saying Tono-Bungay till I thought he was clean off his onion, and singing-what was it?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090818"><said direct=True>"'</said><said direct=False>I'm afloat, I'm afloat,'" I guessed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090819"><said direct=True>"The very thing. You'</said><said direct=False>ve heard him. And saying our fortunes were made. Took me out to the Ho'burm Restaurant, George,-dinner, and we had champagne, stuff that blows up the back of your nose and makes you go SO, and he said at last he'd got things worthy of me-and we moved here next day. It's a swell house, George. Three pounds a week for the rooms. And he says the Business'll stand it."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090820"><said direct=False>She looked at me doubtfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090821"><said direct=True>"Either do that or smash,"</said><said direct=False> I said profoundly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090822"><said direct=False>We discussed the question for a moment mutely with our eyes. My aunt slapped the pile of books from Mudie's.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090823"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>ve been having such a Go of reading, George. You never did!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090824"><said direct=True>"What do you think of the business?"</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090825"><said direct=True>"Well, they'</said><said direct=False>ve let him have money," she said, and thought and raised her eyebrows.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090826"><said direct=True>"It'</said><said direct=False>s been a time," she went on. "The flapping about! Me sitting doing nothing and him on the go like a rocket. He's done wonders. But he wants you, George-he wants you. Sometimes he's full of hope-talks of when we're going to have a carriage and be in society-makes it seem so natural and topsy-turvy, I hardly know whether my old heels aren't up here listening to him, and my old head on the floor.... Then he gets depressed. Says he wants restraint. Says he can make a splash but can't keep on. Says if you don't come in everything will smash-But you are coming in?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090827"><said direct=False>She paused and looked at me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090828"><said direct=False>"Well-"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090829"><said direct=True>"You don'</said><said direct=False>t say you won't come in!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090830"><said direct=True>"But look here, aunt,"</said><said direct=False> I said, "do you understand quite?... It's a quack medicine. It's trash."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090831"><said direct=True>"There'</said><said direct=False>s no law against selling quack medicine that I know of," said my aunt. She thought for a minute and became unusually grave. "It's our only chance, George," she said. "If it doesn't go..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090832"><said direct=False>There came the slamming of a door, and a loud bellowing from the next apartment through the folding doors. "Here-er Shee Rulk lies Poo Tom Bo-oling."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090833"><said direct=True>"Silly old Concertina! Hark at him, George!"</said><said direct=False> She raised her voice. "Don't sing that, you old Walrus, you! Sing 'I'm afloat!'"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090834"><said direct=False>One leaf of the folding doors opened and my uncle appeared.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090835"><said direct=False>"Hullo, George! Come along at last? Gossome tea-cake, Susan?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090836"><said direct=True>"Thought it over George?"</said><said direct=False> he said abruptly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090837"><said direct=True>"Yes,"</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090838"><said direct=False>"Coming in?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090839"><said direct=False>I paused for a last moment and nodded yes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090840"><said direct=True>"Ah!"</said><said direct=False> he cried. "Why couldn't you say that a week ago?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090841"><said direct=True>"I'</said><said direct=False>ve had false ideas about the world," I said. "Oh! they don't matter now! Yes, I'll come, I'll take my chance with you, I won't hesitate again."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090842"><said direct=False>And I didn't. I stuck to that resolution for seven long years.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090843"><said direct=False>So I made my peace with my uncle, and we set out upon this bright enterprise of selling slightly injurious rubbish at one-and-three-halfpence and two-and-nine a bottle, including the Government stamp. We made Tono-Bungay hum! It brought us wealth, influence, respect, the confidence of endless people. All that my uncle promised me proved truth and understatement; Tono-Bungay carried me to freedoms and powers that no life of scientific research, no passionate service of humanity could ever have given me....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090844"><said direct=False>It was my uncle's genius that did it. No doubt he needed me,-I was, I will admit, his indispensable right hand; but his was the brain to conceive. He wrote every advertisement; some of them even he sketched. You must remember that his were the days before the Time took to enterprise and the vociferous hawking of that antiquated Encyclopedia. That alluring, button-holing, let-me -just-tell-you-quite-soberly-something-you-ought-to-know style of newspaper advertisement, with every now and then a convulsive jump of some attractive phrase into capitals, was then almost a novelty. "Many people who are MODERATELY well think they are QUITE well," was one of his early efforts. The jerks in capitals were, "DO NOT NEED DRUGS OR MEDICINE," and "SIMPLY A PROPER REGIMEN TO GET YOU IN TONE." One was warned against the chemist or druggist who pushed "much-advertised nostrums" on one's attention. That trash did more harm than good. The thing needed was regimen-and Tono-Bungay!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090845"><said direct=False>Very early, too, was that bright little quarter column, at least it was usually a quarter column in the evening papers: "HILARITY-Tono-Bungay. Like Mountain Air in the Veins." The penetrating trio of questions: "Are you bored with your Business? Are you bored with your Dinner. Are you bored with your Wife?"-that, too, was in our Gower Street days. Both these we had in our first campaign when we worked London south central, and west; and then, too, we had our first poster-the HEALTH, BEAUTY, AND STRENGTH one. That was his design; I happen still to have got by me the first sketch he made for it. I have reproduced it here with one or two others to enable the reader to understand the mental quality that initiated these familiar ornaments of London.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090846"><said direct=False>(The second one is about eighteen months later, the germ of the well-known "Fog" poster; the third was designed for an influenza epidemic, but never issued.)</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090847"><said direct=False>These things were only incidental in my department.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090848"><said direct=False>I had to polish them up for the artist and arrange the business of printing and distribution, and after my uncle had had a violent and needless quarrel with the advertising manager of the Daily Regulator about the amount of display given to one of his happy thoughts, I also took up the negotiations of advertisements for the press.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090849"><said direct=False>We discussed and worked out distribution together first in the drawing-room floor in Gower Street with my aunt sometimes helping very shrewdly, and then, with a steadily improving type of cigar and older and older whisky, in his smuggery at their first house, the one in Beckenham. Often we worked far into the night sometimes until dawn.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090850"><said direct=False>We really worked infernally hard, and, I recall, we worked with a very decided enthusiasm, not simply on my uncle's part but mine, It was a game, an absurd but absurdly interesting game, and the points were scored in cases of bottles. People think a happy notion is enough to make a man rich, that fortunes can be made without toil. It's a dream, as every millionaire (except one or two lucky gamblers) can testify; I doubt if J.D. Rockefeller in the early days of Standard Oil, worked harder than we did. We worked far into the night-and we also worked all day. We made a rule to be always dropping in at the factory unannounced to keep things right-for at first we could afford no properly responsible underlings-and we traveled London, pretending to be our own representatives and making all sorts of special arrangements.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090851"><said direct=False>But none of this was my special work, and as soon as we could get other men in, I dropped the traveling, though my uncle found it particularly interesting and kept it up for years. "Does me good, George, to see the chaps behind their counters like I was once," he explained. My special and distinctive duty was to give Tono-Bungay substance and an outward and visible bottle, to translate my uncle's great imaginings into the creation of case after case of labelled bottles of nonsense, and the punctual discharge of them by railway, road and steamer towards their ultimate goal in the Great Stomach of the People. By all modern standards the business was, as my uncle would say, "absolutely bona fide." We sold our stuff and got the money, and spent the money honestly in lies and clamour to sell more stuff. Section by section we spread it over the whole of the British Isles; first working the middle-class London suburbs, then the outer suburbs, then the home counties, then going (with new bills and a more pious style of "ad") into Wales, a great field always for a new patent-medicine, and then into Lancashire.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090852"><said direct=False>My uncle had in his inner office a big map of England, and as we took up fresh sections of the local press and our consignments invaded new areas, flags for advertisements and pink underlines for orders showed our progress.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090853"><said direct=True>"The romance of modern commerce, George!"</said><said direct=False> my uncle would say, rubbing his hands together and drawing in air through his teeth. "The romance of modern commerce, eh? Conquest. Province by province. Like sogers."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090854"><said direct=False>We subjugated England and Wales; we rolled over the Cheviots with a special adaptation containing eleven per cent. of absolute alcohol; "Tono-Bungay: Thistle Brand." We also had the Fog poster adapted to a kilted Briton in a misty Highland scene.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090855"><said direct=False>Under the shadow of our great leading line we were presently taking subsidiary specialties into action; "Tono-Bungay Hair Stimulant" was our first supplement. Then came "Concentrated Tono-Bungay" for the eyes. That didn't go, but we had a considerable success with the Hair Stimulant. We broached the subject, I remember, in a little catechism beginning: "Why does the hair fall out? Because the follicles are fagged. What are the follicles?..." So it went on to the climax that the Hair Stimulant contained all "The essential principles of that most reviving tonic, Tono-Bungay, together with an emollient and nutritious oil derived from crude Neat's Foot Oil by a process of refinement, separation and deodorization.... It will be manifest to any one of scientific attainments that in Neat's Foot Oil derived from the hoofs and horns of beasts, we must necessarily have a natural skin and hair lubricant."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090856"><said direct=False>And we also did admirable things with our next subsidiaries, "Tono-Bungay Lozenges," and "Tono-Bungay Chocolate." These we urged upon the public for their extraordinary nutritive and recuperative value in cases of fatigue and strain. We gave them posters and illustrated advertisements showing climbers hanging from marvelously vertical cliffs, cyclist champions upon the track, mounted messengers engaged in Aix-to-Ghent rides, soldiers lying out in action under a hot sun. "You can GO for twenty-four hours," we declared, "on Tono-Bungay Chocolate." We didn't say whether you could return on the same commodity. We also showed a dreadfully barristerish barrister, wig, side-whiskers, teeth, a horribly life-like portrait of all existing barristers, talking at a table, and beneath, this legend: "A Four Hours' Speech on Tono-Bungay Lozenges, and as fresh as when he began." Then brought in regiments of school-teachers, revivalist ministers, politicians and the like. I really do believe there was an element of "kick" in the strychnine in these lozenges, especially in those made according to our earlier formula. For we altered all our formulae-invariably weakening them enormously as sales got ahead.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090857"><said direct=False>In a little while-so it seems to me now-we were employing travelers and opening up Great Britain at the rate of a hundred square miles a day. All the organisation throughout was sketched in a crude, entangled, half-inspired fashion by my uncle, and all of it had to be worked out into a practicable scheme of quantities and expenditure by me. We had a lot of trouble finding our travelers; in the end at least half of them were Irish-Americans, a wonderful breed for selling medicine. We had still more trouble over our factory manager, because of the secrets of the inner room, and in the end we got a very capable woman, Mrs. Hampton Diggs, who had formerly managed a large millinery workroom, whom we could trust to keep everything in good working order without finding out anything that wasn't put exactly under her loyal and energetic nose. She conceived a high opinion of Tono-Bungay and took it in all forms and large quantities so long as I knew her. It didn't seem to do her any harm. And she kept the girls going quite wonderfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090858"><said direct=False>My uncle's last addition to the Tono-Bungay group was the Tono-Bungay Mouthwash. The reader has probably read a hundred times that inspiring inquiry of his, "You are Young Yet, but are you Sure Nothing has Aged your Gums?"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090859"><said direct=False>And after that we took over the agency for three or four good American lines that worked in with our own, and could be handled with it; Texan Embrocation, and "23-to clear the system" were the chief....</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090860"><said direct=False>I set down these bare facts. To me they are all linked with the figure of my uncle. In some of the old seventeenth and early eighteenth century prayerbooks at Bladesover there used to be illustrations with long scrolls coming out of the mouths of the wood-cut figures. I wish I could write all this last chapter on a scroll coming out of the head of my uncle, show it all the time as unfolding and pouring out from a short, fattening, small-legged man with stiff cropped hair, disobedient glasses on a perky little nose, and a round stare behind them. I wish I could show you him breathing hard and a little through his nose as his pen scrabbled out some absurd inspiration for a poster or a picture page, and make you hear his voice, charged with solemn import like the voice of a squeaky prophet, saying, "George! list'n! I got an ideer. I got a notion! George!"</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090861"><said direct=False>I should put myself into the same picture. Best setting for us, I think, would be the Beckenham snuggery, because there we worked hardest. It would be the lamplit room of the early nineties, and the clock upon the mantel would indicate midnight or later. We would be sitting on either side of the fire, I with a pipe, my uncle with a cigar or cigarette. There would be glasses standing inside the brass fender. Our expressions would be very grave. My uncle used to sit right back in his armchair; his toes always turned in when he was sitting down and his legs had a way of looking curved, as though they hadn't bones or joints but were stuffed with sawdust.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090862"><said direct=True>"George, whad'</said><said direct=False>yer think of T.B. for sea-sickness?" he would say.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090863"><said direct=False>"No good that I can imagine."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090864"><said direct=False>"Oom! No harm TRYING, George. We can but try."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090865"><said direct=False>I would suck my pipe. "Hard to get at. Unless we sold our stuff specially at the docks. Might do a special at Cook's office, or in the Continental Bradshaw."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090866"><said direct=True>"It '</said><said direct=False>ud give 'em confidence, George."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090867"><said direct=False>He would Zzzz, with his glasses reflecting the red of the glowing coals.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090868"><said direct=True>"No good hiding our light under a Bushel,"</said><said direct=False> he would remark.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090869"><said direct=False>I never really determined whether my uncle regarded Tono-Bungay as a fraud, or whether he didn't come to believe in it in a kind of way by the mere reiteration of his own assertions. I think that his average attitude was one of kindly, almost parental, toleration. I remember saying on one occasion, "But you don't suppose this stuff ever did a human being the slightest good all?" and how his face assumed a look of protest, as of one reproving harshness and dogmatism.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090870"><said direct=True>"You'</said><said direct=False>ve a hard nature, George," he said. "You're too ready to run things down. How can one TELL? How can one venture to TELL!..."</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090871"><said direct=False>I suppose any creative and developing game would have interested me in those years. At any rate, I know I put as much zeal into this Tono-Bungay as any young lieutenant could have done who suddenly found himself in command of a ship. It was extraordinarily interesting to me to figure out the advantage accruing from this shortening of the process or that, and to weigh it against the capital cost of the alteration. I made a sort of machine for sticking on the labels, that I patented; to this day there is a little trickle of royalties to me from that. I also contrived to have our mixture made concentrated, got the bottles, which all came sliding down a guarded slant-way, nearly filled with distilled water at one tap, and dripped our magic ingredients in at the next. This was an immense economy of space for the inner sanctum. For the bottling we needed special taps, and these, too, I invented and patented.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19090872"><said direct=False>We had a sort of endless band of bottles sliding along an inclined glass trough made slippery with running water. At one end a girl held them up to the light, put aside any that were imperfect and placed the others in the trough; the filling was automatic; at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet. Each tank, the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled water, had a level indicator, and inside I had a float arrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low. Another girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand them to the three packers, who slipped them into their outer papers and put them, with a pad of corrugated paper between each pair, into a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into position in our standard packing-case. It sounds wild, I know, but I believe I was the first man in the city of London to pack patent medicines through the side of the packing-case, to discover there was a better way in than by the lid. Our cases packed themselves, practically; had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs, who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side. Our girls, moreover, packed with corrugated paper and matchbook-wood box partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to pack through the top of the box with straw, many breakages and much waste and confusion.</said></p>
