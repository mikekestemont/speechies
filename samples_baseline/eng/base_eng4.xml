<sample><p n="ENG19020839"><said direct=True>“There'</said><said direct=False>s only one thing I wish you would do for me,” Chloe went on. “Don't let the first families of Elmhurst know one of my uncles is a bishop, or they'll call. We want to be quiet. And we live here because the house is our own. The late owner was my husband's uncle.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020840"><said direct=False>I came down at this point and was presented to the vicaress. She quite thawed, and we had a pleasant tea. But when we called on her she was as stiff and almost as disagreeable as ever. The habits of a lifetime cannot be uprooted even by such a delightful experience as quarrelling and making it up again with Chloe. When she had gone that day Chloe began to cry. A woman can never get into a royal rage without tears for a sequel.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020841"><said direct=False>The awful truth about Chloe's uncle must have leaked out somehow, for later on we had streams of callers. Some of them were rather nice. And the vicar's wife was almost the only snob among them. But they were the sort of people who might have called on us anywhere, and they have really no place in the story of the Red House.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020842"><said direct=False>Yolande wrote to us that she could let one of our cottages to a desirable tenant. We wrote back giving her full powers.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020843"><said direct=False>At the end of the week Mary and her Jim came back to us and took up their dwelling in the “rooms beyond the kitchen.” Two days later Yolande led me to the cottage desecrated by the presence of Prosser. It was empty. The garden had been cleared of all the unseemly litter that during his occupancy had defiled it. A portion of the cottage garden had even been dug and cleared of weeds. The cottage next door to Prosser's presented a spotless door-step, and its shining windows blinked at us over snowy muslin short blinds.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020844"><said direct=True>“How did you manage it?”</said><said direct=False> I asked, in rapturous admiration.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020845"><said direct=False>“How do you get a rat out of its hole?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020846"><said direct=False>“Put in a ferret.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020847"><said direct=False>“Wise man! And what does the rat do when it sees the ferret?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020848"><said direct=False>“Bolts!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020849"><said direct=False>“So did Prosser. He knew he was a rat, and fair game for the ferret by virtue of more than one shady act. So when I put in the ferret he bolted.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020850"><said direct=False>“But your ferret?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020851"><said direct=False>“I let the next—door cottage to the ferret for seven and sixpence a week. Rents are high here. There are very few cottages.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020852"><said direct=True>“That'</said><said direct=False>s about eighteen pounds a year. Yolande, you're a goddess! And who is your ferret?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020853"><said direct=False>“His name is Bates. He is a perfectly respectable ferret. I gave him a hint to give Prosser a hint, and Prosser took it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020854"><said direct=True>“Let'</said><said direct=False>s go and tell Chloe.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020855"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>ve told her. And she wants to work. Let's go into Prosser's house and look over it. I'm afraid it will want doing up. Mrs. Bates has given it what she calls a rough cleaning down already. Mrs. Bates is a woman after my own heart.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020856"><said direct=False>We went over the cottage and decided that it must be repapered throughout.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020857"><said direct=True>“Mrs. Bates can do that. She'</said><said direct=False>s a universal genius.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020858"><said direct=False>“Yet you approve—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020859"><said direct=False>“Yes, in that walk of life.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020860"><said direct=False>I was musing. Chloe and I had often thought that we should like to do a little paper-hanging, but I decided not to tell Yolande this.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020861"><said direct=True>“When it'</said><said direct=False>s cleaned and papered,” she said, with kindling enthusiasm, “I'll let that too.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020862"><said direct=True>“You shall,”</said><said direct=False> I said, and then hastening away from the subject of paper-hanging, lest she should insist on my giving the order for it to Mrs. Bates that very moment, I said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020863"><said direct=True>“By-the-way, you haven'</said><said direct=False>t told me yet wherein consists the ferretiness of your ferret, Bates.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020864"><said direct=True>“Oh, haven'</said><said direct=False>t I?” she said, carelessly. “You see, my ferret's a policeman.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020865"><said direct=False>This, like Yolande's last-solved problem, was simplicity itself. And yet we had never thought of it!</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020866"><said direct=False>HOW had Yolande triumphantly justified her boast—her assertion, rather—that she could do for us what we could not do for ourselves. The only thing left us was to try and be grateful. I am almost sure that I succeeded. For the rest, we were extraordinarily comfortable; our domestic service approached perfection, and was, humanly speaking, assured. Bates, that excellent trained ferret, had dislodged the criminal rat which had been our tenant. Peace hovered above us with wide, white wings. But those wings were not permitted to fold themselves about us, because I had a great-aunt, my aunt George. I think I have had occasion to name her before, in connection with a certain patch-work quilt. She gave us the quilt and a pewter teapot on our marriage. She now, quite suddenly, announced that she was coming to see us. My aunt George is fidgety, inquisitive, interfering, unforgiving, and dictatorial. She is also generous, affectionate to such as will sue to her in forma pauperis, and is an excellent sick-nurse. We, being neither sick nor indigent, and finding our home-grown stock of affection sufficient for our humble needs, hastily intrenched ourselves against a long visit by inviting Yolande to occupy our one furnished spare room. Then we invited all the relations who, like the fairies at christenings, would make themselves disagreeable if they were not bidden to a family feast, and plunged headlong into the most exciting preparations for a house-warming. It was to be an evening party with a cold supper, because we could not expect Mary, single-handed, to serve up a hot dinner to a crowd of carping aunts and uncles. The enthusiasm with which we embarked on our labors was tinged, I think, in both of us, by a desire to show Yolande that we could at least deal masterly with a brief crisis, however little we might be able to organize permanent industries.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020867"><said direct=True>“The materials are unpromising,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “Aunts and uncles aren't the things exactly to make a party ‘go’—but Yolande shall see.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020868"><said direct=True>“Mayn'</said><said direct=False>t we have any young couple?” I pleaded, wistfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020869"><said direct=True>“Of course! Not enough to drown the aunts and uncles, but just enough to remind them how superior they are to the follies of youth, and to incite them to show how much more cheerful they can be, in their maturity, than these restless—Oh, Len, I'</said><said direct=False>m talking like a goody-goody book. Come on; let's make a list of who we'll ask, and what we will give them to eat, and who shall sit beside who, and then we'll decide where they're to eat it. We'll save up the peaches for the party. There are three hundred and twenty-six of them.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020870"><said direct=False>It is delightful to have three hundred and twenty-six peaches of your very own. It is charming to make lists, especially on rather rough paper, with a B.B. pencil. It is also delightful to roam through a big house, your very, very own, and to decide in which of its many rooms you shall hear the health and happiness of your house toasted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020871"><said direct=True>“It must be the drawing-room,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, at last, “and we must have little tables, with candles and paper shades, like in a hotel, and everything carved on a sideboard.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020872"><said direct=True>“We haven'</said><said direct=False>t a sideboard,” I said, feebly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020873"><said direct=True>“Oh, we can make a sideboard in three minutes—those packing-cases Yolande'</said><said direct=False>s china came in. We'll make a big one while we're about it—a really impressive sideboard.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020874"><said direct=False>We did make it-in something under three hours. Draped in the red liberty curtains hastily taken down from our bedroom, and covered with a fair white cloth, it was—being ten feet long and four feet high—positively crushing in its impressiveness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020875"><said direct=False>We collected all the tables from the other rooms,—even the writing-table from the loafery was brought in—gate tables, Pembroke tables round tables, square tables, long narrow tables, our own tables, Mary's tables, and Mrs. Bates's tables. We selected the least leggy, and arranged our guests' name-cards. The question of wall decorations agitated us a good deal.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020876"><said direct=True>“If we took every pikky we'</said><said direct=False>ve got out of all the other rooms,” Chloe said, “they'd hardly show in this great barn. There ought to be some idea—Oh, Len, of course! wreaths of evergreens right up high—oh!—and a frieze of pink muslin, and the evergreens in loops and swags. Delicious!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“If we took every pikky we've got out of all the other rooms,” Chloe said, “they'd hardly show in this great barn. There ought to be some idea</said><said direct=True>—Oh, Len, of course! wreaths of evergreens right up high—</said><said direct=False>oh!—and a frieze of pink muslin, and the evergreens in loops and swags. Delicious!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020877"><said direct=False>It takes some time to make properly graduated loops and swags for a room forty feet by twenty-five, and it takes some material. The evergreens in our garden had not had such a pruning this many a year. But we did it; we thought of Yolande, and we did not flinch, though our fingers were blistered and our backs a weariness long before the wreaths were done. The pink muslin proved to be too ruinously expensive, but we bought a pink “lining paper” and pasted it up, and when we had nailed up the evergreens we felt that the result almost paid for our three days' hard labor.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020878"><said direct=False>Chloe fell into my arms in an ecstasy of mingled pride and exhaustion. “It's a dream,” she said, “an Italian palace! But, oh, I never want to touch box or yew or laurel again as long as I live! And we've only three days now! There'll hardly be time to cook anything.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020879"><said direct=False>A fury of egg-beating drove me forth. A man, I was assured, was worse than useless in matters of cuisine. The crisis was urgent; I forebore to complicate it by argument; but Soyer and his noble army of followers seemed to back up my insulted sex, as I walked down the garden-paths, whose breast-high weed growths, mown down by Jim in leisure moments, now permitted glimpses of low-hanging red and golden fruit and russet leaves. The hour was five—nominally tea-time—but what man worthy the name would thrust the need of boiling kettles on two ardent women strenuous in the compounding of sweets?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020880"><said direct=False>I walked softly in the tennis shoes to which a country life seduces the weaker brethren, and the path was still weed-grown enough to betray nothing of my drawing near to the biggest of the peach-trees on the red south wall. The espaliers connived at my approach by the shelter of their wide-spread arms. Thus it was that I came plump on a man, midway up my wall; his foot rested where a broken brick had been dislodged. He was handing up peaches—my peaches—reserved for the high destiny of auntal and avuncular palates—to a ruffian with a basket, who, in broad day, only one big garden's breadth from a policeman-ferret, sat astride my wall. Some one whistled—it was not I; a spring, a swear, and both villains vanished as if by magic into the paddock. I climbed the wall; they had disappeared in the nettle-coverts of our orchard; nor, when I threaded those coverts, could I run them to earth. It was a poor consolation to return, my feet soaked to the bone through my tennis shoes, to count the peaches and to find that the despicable outcasts had only taken fifteen out of the three hundred and twenty-six.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020881"><said direct=False>How age mellows one's views! As a boy I never could understand why farmers made such a fuss about a few apples or plums. Now, all the land-owner welled up within me, and I understood it all—with an understanding as full as it was bitter. I thought of netting, of man-traps, of a fierce bull-dog, of men with guns—myself and Jim by turns—incessantly patrolling ling my garden. All other crimes in the decalogue might, I felt, admit of some valid excuse, some reasonable explanation. But breaking the eighth commandment—and with peaches—my peaches—it was intolerable! I felt myself cut off once and forever from the communion of school-boys. Villon was now merely despicable to me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020882"><said direct=False>I forebore to fling my heavy news among the eggs, but Yolande came that evening to occupy the spare room, and at dinner I judged the time ripe. My thrilling narrative fell, to my amazement, on inattentive ears. Chloe, whose horror and reprobation I had expected to exceed even my own, merely said, with what I could not persuade myself was a calmness assumed to temper my own agitation: “Oh, did they, dear? How horrid of them!” and absently pressed more fish on me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020883"><said direct=False>I withdrew into a proud reserve. When, with a studied air of aloofness, I had carved the mutton, and Mary, having handed the plates and vegetables, left the room, Chloe laid down her fork, and with sparkling eyes turned to Yolande.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020884"><said direct=True>“Now,”</said><said direct=False> she said, and there was just that suppressed fire about her that I had hoped to waken by my tale of the fruit-stealers—“now, I think we might tell him. You tell him, Yolande, because it's your doing, you clever, intelligent—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Now,” she said, and there was just that suppressed fire about her that I had hoped to waken by my tale of the fruit-stealers</said><said direct=True>—“now, I think we might tell him. You tell him, Yolande, because it's your doing, you clever, intelligent—</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020885"><said direct=True>“Spare me,”</said><said direct=False> Yolande interrupted; “whatever my faults may be, I'm not intelligent. That's what the police always are when they can't find out the murderer.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020886"><said direct=True>“Unintelligent as you are,”</said><said direct=False> said I, “you'll perhaps be able to break the news gently. My nerves are unstrung by to-day's revelation of the cynical immorality of men with baskets.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020887"><said direct=True>“Tell him, tell him,”</said><said direct=False> urged Chloe, impatiently. “Len, you're like Nero, talking about unimportant things when— No, nothing's burning. Yolande, if you don't tell him I shall.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020888"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s nothing,” said Yolande, nonchalantly, crumbling her bread and looking down so as to express indifference with her eyelashes—a very graceful accomplishment. “It's really nothing—only you gave me carte blanche as your land agent, and I've let the big cottage for you—not Prosser's—the one on the other side.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It's nothing,” said Yolande, nonchalantly, crumbling her bread and looking down so as to express indifference with her eyelashes</said><said direct=True>—a very graceful accomplishment. “It's really nothing—</said><said direct=False>only you gave me carte blanche as your land agent, and I've let the big cottage for you—not Prosser's—the one on the other side.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It's nothing,” said Yolande, nonchalantly, crumbling her bread and looking down so as to express indifference with her eyelashes—a very graceful accomplishment. “It's really nothing—only you gave me carte blanche as your land agent, and I've let the big cottage for you</said><said direct=True>—not Prosser's—</said><said direct=False>the one on the other side.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020889"><said direct=False>“You have? Chloe, I know it seems the basest ingratitude to Yolande, but—think of Prosser, fairest of land agents, and tell me frankly, has he any references?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020890"><said direct=True>“He simply bristles with them. His bank, Coutts'</said><said direct=False>s, and his father, a cotton-broker of absolute eminence, were enough for me.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020891"><said direct=True>“But where did you catch him? The sons of cotton-brokers with balances at Coutts'</said><said direct=False>s are not found in every bush. How did you do it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020892"><said direct=True>“C'</said><said direct=False>est tout simple. I advertised. You never thought of that? No. Well, we all have our limitations. Chloe, if you let him throw bread at me I shall tell the tenant the house is unhealthy, and he won't take it. I advertised, he answered. I interviewed the bank and the cottonbroker,—incredibly eminent he really is; I saw it at once. The man himself is a man of action. The agreement, signed, lies warm at this moment against Chloe's heart.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020893"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s in her Gladstone,” said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020894"><said direct=False>“The man moves his furniture down this week, and there we are!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020895"><said direct=True>“He'</said><said direct=False>s a journalist, or an author, or something,” said Chloe. “I expect he's awfully nice. Isn't she a genius?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020896"><said direct=True>“The rent'</said><said direct=False>s a minor point, of course,” I said, humbly, “but if one might ask?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020897"><said direct=True>“The rent?”</said><said direct=False> Chloe jumped up from her chair and came round to me. “Oh, Len, what impossibly fortunate people we are! Guess the rent!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020898"><said direct=True>“A hundred a year!”</said><said direct=False> I said, promptly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020899"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t be horrid.” Chloe's disappointment was very pretty. “I thought you'd say twenty.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020900"><said direct=True>“I didn'</said><said direct=False>t dare. What is it? Fifteen?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020901"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s thirty-five!” cried my wife; and at that my generous heart could no longer forbear, and I toasted Yolande in bottled beer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020902"><said direct=False>When the enthusiasm of a landlord had sobered in me somewhat, I led the talk back to my fruit-thief—to my secret soul still the most interesting possible topic, because he was my find; the tenant was merely Yolande's. And by skilful tactics I presently roused Yolande's sympathies. The tactics were quite simple. I asked her advice. At once the affair assumed in her eyes new proportions—a new complexion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020903"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know,” she said, knitting her brows; “there must be some way.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020904"><said direct=True>“You see,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “if one repaired the whole wall, there are ladders, and dark nights to set them up in. You can feel peaches in the dark. And broken bottles can be overcome by sacks of straw—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020905"><said direct=True>“And all difficulties by a little thought,”</said><said direct=False> she interrupted, with that superb air of finality which I equally and intensely admire and detest. “Well, I'll think about it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020906"><said direct=False>Yolande was not allowed to help at all in the organizing of the house-warming. An obedient execution of Chloe's orders was all that was permitted her. And when I saw the charming docility with which she carried these out, and her rigorous abstention from even the pointing of an uninvited finger at any pie of Chloe's, I confess that I was humbled and abashed, as in the presence of a soul greater than my own.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020907"><said direct=False>No one who has not given a party of the dimensions of ours can have the least idea of the Herculean labors involved. We all worked like galley-slaves, and on the morning before the party but little provision had been made save cakes, and the last batch of these were burned because Chloe, who had undertaken to watch their baking, had become all too deeply absorbed in the French cookery-book's recipe for soles à la Normande, a dish which we had neither the means nor the skill to prepare. She came into the hall where Yolande and I were washing the best dessert service,—for so large a party all plates must be requisitioned,—sank on to a chair, stuck out her feet straight before her—an attitude recognized in our code as indicating despair—and said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020908"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s no use; you'd better send wires to put them all off. The beef is quite the wrong shape; the ham is nearly raw, I'm certain; and none of the things have come from the Stores. And now the cakes are burned!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020909"><said direct=True>“Poor little King Alfred!”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Never mind; we'll worry through somehow.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020910"><said direct=False>Do I wrong Yolande, or did a gleam of satisfaction flash through the downcast lashes of eyes ostensibly busy with dish-washing? Did she really say to herself: “I told you so! You can't organize worth a cent, either of you”?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020911"><said direct=False>I hope not; I almost think not. But, after all, most of us are human, and why not Yolande?</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020912"><said direct=False>Anyhow, if any stirring of the old Adam rose at that moment in Yolande, it was fought down in an instant, and she was imploring Chloe to tell her what to do—to let her run up to town for the Stores-things—anything, everything, rather than that Chloe should be worried and turn her hair gray before its time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020913"><said direct=False>At this, the absolutely perfect psychological moment, a shadow fell on the red and white marble from a figure approaching the front door, and a soft voice said, “Mrs. Bates.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020914"><said direct=True>“She doesn'</said><said direct=False>t live here,” said Yolande, courteously. She took the word, for Chloe, on the verge of tears, sat speechless. “She lives at the first cottage on the way to the station.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020915"><said direct=True>“I know,”</said><said direct=False> said the soft voice, betraying in its fourth word the charming accent of the dales. “I am Mrs. Bates, and your Mary was telling me you were having a party, and I thought short-handed as likely as not; if there was anything I could do—I lived as cook before I was married—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I know,” said the soft voice, betraying in its fourth word the charming accent of the dales. “I am Mrs. Bates, and your Mary was telling me you were having a party, and I thought short-handed as likely as not; if there was anything I could do</said><said direct=True>—I lived as cook before I was married—</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020916"><said direct=False>The situation was saved, and it was Mrs. Bates who saved it—or, to be more accurate, it was Mary, who had drawn Mrs. Bates to our rescue. And—I saw it in Yolande's eyes, though perhaps it was not there—it was really Yolande who had saved the situation, since it was she who had saved to us Mary. Even if I did see it, I dare not grudge Yolande that fleeting triumph. Before the party was over— But let me, above all, tell my tale orderly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020917"><said direct=False>For the rest of that day Mrs. Bates and Mary wrought, unaided, in the kitchen, for Chloe, in the abrupt reaction from despair, became suddenly enlightened as to a far more important matter than even food. She had nothing to wear, save yellow, which Aunt George could never abide, and pale blue, in which Uncle Bletherthwaite always remarked how washed-out she looked. So the rest of the day passed in washing, dyeing, and ironing her primrose-colored liberty silk.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020918"><said direct=False>The dye was pale pink, a brilliant scarlet, or a deep crimson, according to the measure of its dilution. Several minor articles were irrevocably ocably ruined, and gallons of ruddy dye stood about the bath-room in pails, before the right shade of delicate pink was achieved in one of my best white silk ties. Then the primrose gown became rose-colored, and was rinsed and dried and ironed till it looked like a newly blown hollyhock blossom.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020919"><said direct=True>“I wish there was something more to do,”</said><said direct=False> Chloe said, sighing; “it does seem such a pity to waste all this lovely dye.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020920"><said direct=False>My cousin, an experimental chemist, had given me the dye, with the words: “The only thing is, it's such a pure, perfect color, your wife will want to dye everything in the house with it. Don't let her!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020921"><said direct=False>Thus forewarned, I was firm, and I carried away the pails. Yolande followed me, begging that the dye might not be thrown away. She would find a use for it. So I put it in the tool-shed among the rakes and forks, the garden syringe, and the grass-cutter—the only place where I could feel sure that no uncle would kick it over inadvertently, no aunt absently sit down on it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020922"><said direct=False>And now it was the day of the house-warming. It was a fine day, and, acting on a sudden inspiration, Yolande and I rode over to Blackheath on our bicycles, returning laden with light, enormous mous parcels. They were colored Chinese lanterns. We hung them from the trees near the house. And then, further inspired, I tore off for more, and we strung them on wires and made the house beautiful with them. The big drawing-room, with its evergreen garlands, its little white-draped tables, sparkling with borrowed glass and silver, its bowls of radiant dahlias, its tall green glasses of Japanese anemones, its pinkshaded candles, and over all the mellow glow of the many-colored lanterns, was a picture at which our hearts beat high with pride. The sideboard groaned (it really did groan, and that in no mere commonplace metaphorical way, but honestly, because it was, in its inmost heart, only packing-cases) beneath the weight of as fine a cold supper as any aunt could wish to see, any uncle wish to eat. Chloe's pink hollyhock gown was an exquisite success. Yolande's was like a white hollyhock bloom. All was ready. The first wheels crushed the gravel of our drive. The first uncle was relieved of his great-coat by my hands, the first aunt escorted by Chloe to “take off her things.” Aunts will not dispense with personal attendance in this ceremony. Gradually the hall filled. Ponderous uncles and portly aunts occupied the heavier chairs. Lean aunts and uncles stood conversing with frosty geniality. A great-uncle and a second-cousin who had not spoken for years—a family affair about a trust and an Australian gold-mine, nothing personally discreditable to either—sank their old feud and found out how much they still had in common, as they discussed in a wheezy undertone the extraordinary extravagance of their host and hostess—agreeing almost cordially in the opinion that we were living in a style far, far beyond our means. Cousins of every degree enthusiastically compared notes as to the difficulty of getting to our house. Three nice nieces and a manly nephew or two offered conventional amiabilities to their elders. We had furnished and adorned the hall, and no one, we felt, could look on its marble floor and wainscoted walls without feeling himself privileged in being allowed to take part in such a pageant, so admirably staged. My aunt George objected to the wainscot as dark and out of date, and said the marble floor was cold to the feet. My uncle Reginald agreed with her, but added handsomely that beggars mustn't be choosers, and no doubt we were wise not to waste our money on carpets. Altogether, everything was going splendidly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020923"><said direct=False>When the gong sounded I think it was felt to be an extravagance. I remedied this as far as I could by telling Aunt George, as I gave her my arm, that the gong was a wedding-present to Chloe. And so it was, but I bought it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020924"><said direct=False>We crowded into the big drawing-room. Even Aunt George admitted that it looked very nice—but not until I had asked her if it didn't. And then she said it would have looked better without those Christmas decorations! These were our loops and swags. I saw more than one uncle cast a glance at the foot of the sideboard as he passed, and I wondered in anguish whether the drapery had displaced itself and the naked packing-cases were disclosed to the shocked eyes of aunts. But I could not see. Yet the suspense was unbearable. Under pretext of turning down a lamp, I went to see. I must know the worst. The worst was a row—a long row—of gold-topped bottles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020925"><said direct=False>I flashed reproachful glances at Chloe, and as I passed behind her chair, she murmured: “It's all right. Asti. The new tenant.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020926"><said direct=False>It seemed to me, in my agitation, to be like the new tenant's cheek, and not at all like Chloe, but this was no time for anything but the duties of a host. I returned to Aunt George, who said, “I wish to goodness you wouldn't run about so!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020927"><said direct=False>Mary and Mrs. Bates waited, and the waiting ing was excellent. So was the Chianti, which was all I had intended our wine-bill to run to. But the uncles looked at the gold-topped bottles, so did some of the cousins. The aunts looked away from them. So I said: “Aunt George, we've some very fine Italian sparkling wine here—a present. I should like you to try it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020928"><said direct=False>As soon as I had said “a present,” I caught my wife's shocked glance, and knew the truth; she had bought the Asti on the strength of our new tenant. But the words were out; so, in a few moments, were the corks. The avuncular condemnation of Italian vintages was almost unanimous—but avuncular eyes sparkled, and a sort of soft current of cheerfulness passed round the room. At the round table at the other end where sat the nephews and nieces and the few young people whom we had asked to meet them, there was a low buzz of chattering and laughter. Yolande was at that table. She had insisted on it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020929"><said direct=True>“Your uncle George always said,”</said><said direct=False> my aunt George was saying, as she held out her glass to be refilled, “that no sparkling wine was worth the drinking except—” when a sudden rapping on the table left her with only time for a, “Well, I'm sure,” before a general silence abashed her into quiet.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020930"><said direct=False>Uncle Bletherthwaite rose heavily in his place. He made a speech. The Fates forbid that I should render it to you. It was of a studied temperateness; it dwelt on our blessings; expressed, tepidly, the pleasure he felt in seeing us at last (he repeated “at last,” and I knew he was thinking that it was eight months since he had dined with us) in our home and with our family (he looked at Yolande) gathered about us. It dwelt, and I thought at somewhat too great a length, on the good dinners he had eaten in this house in my uncle Thomas's days, and the good wine he had drunk (he looked disparagingly at the Asti); it ended by a formal hope that we and those now assembled round our board might long be spared (which I could see he didn't think likely), and with a wish that our new home might be a blessing to us. (Of course it was perfectly plain that, however much he might wish it, it appeared to him but too improbable.) He said, finally, and with a sigh, “I and your aunts and cousins and other relations, including, I am sure, those present who are not members of the family, drink to the prosperity of the Red House.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020931"><said direct=False>The toast was drunk in the gloomiest silence—as to the memory of those who had fallen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020932"><said direct=False>All the lights seemed to burn lower; there was an awkward pause. Chloe bit her lip and would not look at me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020933"><said direct=False>Then suddenly there was another buzz from the youthful table, and our eldest nephew rose in his place.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020934"><said direct=True>“Ladies and gentlemen,”</said><said direct=False> he began (adding by what was scarcely a happy after-thought, “and aunts and uncles”), “we have drunk to the old house, and now I want to call another toast—with your kind permission,” he said, catching the eye of an elderly cousin. “So fill your glasses, please—no heel-taps—bumpers, please! Here's to the jolliest aunt and uncle that ever were. The dearest and kindest and jolliest and best—Aunt Chloe and Uncle Len. Long life and happiness to them! God bless them! There!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began (adding by what was scarcely a happy after-thought, “and aunts and uncles”), “we have drunk to the old house, and now I want to call another toast</said><said direct=True>—with your kind permission,” he said, catching the eye of an elderly cousin. “So fill your glasses, please—</said><said direct=False>no heel-taps—bumpers, please! Here's to the jolliest aunt and uncle that ever were. The dearest and kindest and jolliest and best—Aunt Chloe and Uncle Len. Long life and happiness to them! God bless them! There!”</said></p>

God bless them! There!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020935"><said direct=False>It was his first speech, dear boy, and I think he hoped then that it might be his last. I saw his hand trembling as he lifted his glass. Then suddenly all the young people stood up; a momentary hesitation ended in the rustling rising of elder relatives, and through the rustle came the first words of the refrain, from the young table: “For they are jolly good fellows, For they are jolly good fellows, Oh, they are jolly good fellows, And so say all of us.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020937"><said direct=False>Before the singing was over Aunt George was leading it in her high sweet old voice, and Uncle Bletherthwaite was thundering an irresponsible bass. I did not know where to look, and I believe Chloe nearly wept. I made some sort of speech—I don't know how. Having one's health drunk like that is a thing that doesn't happen often—thank goodness. So one feels it oddly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020938"><said direct=False>The party “went” like wildfire after that. It was almost as delightful as if none of us had been related to each other at all. The tables were cleared, then with the help of nephews and the less frail among the cousins, cleared away bodily. Yolande sang to the guitar, and aunts nodded approval. A niece and a nephew danced a minuet, and cousins were mildly pleased. Then Yvonne and the prettiest niece danced a cachucha, and uncles were enchanted. Some one sang—an uncle, I think; some one sniffed—no doubt an aunt; and coffee was served at the absolutely right moment. Then shawls and hats were handed like refreshments, and we all trooped out into the garden by the moat to look at the moonlight and the Chinese lanterns, craftily lighted by Mrs. Bates while the cachucha was enchanting us. The night was warm as June. Groups of persons—all related, yet for the moment all at peace with each other—stood “beneath the dreaming garden trees.” Chloe and I glowed with a flush of successful hospitality.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020939"><said direct=False>Then suddenly, sharply, the silence of the night, with its soft embroidery of talking and laughter, was shattered—torn roughly asunder by a scream, and another scream, from the walled garden beyond the moat. Feminine cousins paled; male cousins spoke ejaculatorily of pistols; stout uncles breathed heavily of police. A few of us hastened towards the walled garden. At the door that leads to it from the moat garden we came face to face with two figures, a man and a woman, who staggered as they walked; both were in white, and both were stained on face and hands and garments with dark, ominous stains.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020940"><said direct=True>“Just our luck!”</said><said direct=False> I murmured. “What an end to a family party!” For the light of a saffron-colored lantern showed us unmistakably that the stains were blood-red.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020941"><said direct=False>I flung an arm round the blood-stained woman to sustain her. And the woman was Yolande. And I heard my uncle Bletherthwaite murmur, “Well, I never!” as though he had foreseen the whole thing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020942"><said direct=False>A GARDEN hung with soft-tinted Chinese lanterns glowing amid gleams of green leaf-lights and deeps of black leaf-shadow; a company of aunts and uncles placated by food, drink, and the servile attentions of nephews and nieces; a silvery atmosphere of peace, shot with faint streaks of something almost approaching a modified approval; a host and hostess weary, though not wholly exhausted—yet counting the moments till the last uncle, having consumed the ultimate whiskey, should depart in the last of the cabs—and the rest of us—Chloe, Yolande, and I—should be left to look back on the party and “talk it over.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020943"><said direct=False>And now, on this almost pastoral stage, where uncles were all but in tune to pipe, and aunts not far from the mood when one wreathes one's crook with flowers, intrudes a harsh shriek from the darkness of the farther garden, to be followed lowed by the unspeakably dramatic entrance of a man and a woman stained with—well, it looked like blood, exactly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020944"><said direct=False>The woman, as I have said, was Yolande; the man, whom she led familiarly, yet with a certain ferocity, by the hand, was a perfect stranger. His eyes were closed and his face was stained with crimson. It dripped still from his head and ears on to the flannels which earlier in the evening must have been pearly white.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020945"><said direct=False>Every aunt shuddered, every uncle winced. Uncle Bletherthwaite so far forgot himself as to mutter, “Good God!” which, in the “presence of ladies,” was more from him than a good round damn might be from the lighter brethren.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020946"><said direct=False>The nephews and nieces crowded round, cousins drew cautiously near, and as soon as it had been inferred from my attitude in respect to Yolande that she at least was no stranger to me, the semicircle of aunts and uncles closed up about us. Uncle Reginald told me afterwards that he feared the worst just then, for none of them recognized Yolande under her new crimson disguise. As Uncle Reginald said, “They none of them knew her from Adam.” He added, “By Jove! just for the moment I forgot my morals, and I was sorry for you, my boy—I was indeed.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020947"><said direct=False>I do not seek to know what he meant. Chloe was very angry when I told her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020948"><said direct=False>And now there was a breathless silence. It was like the scene in Kipling's His Wedded Wife.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020949"><said direct=False>I broke the silence. I shook Yolande, and said, I fear not too amiably, “My dear girl, what on earth is it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020950"><said direct=True>“Lend me your handkerchief,”</said><said direct=False> she said, irrelevantly; and, taking it, wiped scarlet dews from her brow and hands. “Oh, let me get away. And take him away and clean him, won't you? It's all got into his eyes.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020951"><said direct=False>She dropped the hand of the stranger, and would have fled, but Aunt George barred the way.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020952"><said direct=True>“After this scene we'</said><said direct=False>ve just seen,” she said, “I think it's due to your company to explain.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020953"><said direct=False>The flannelled man got at his handkerchief.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020954"><said direct=True>“Jove! it does sting,”</said><said direct=False> he said, rubbing at his eyes. “I can't get my eyes open. Won't somebody take me where there's a tap and put me under it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020955"><said direct=False>He had a pleasant voice, but it did not soften the aunts and uncles. Curiosity had taken the place of terror.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020956"><said direct=True>“Asking for taps like this,”</said><said direct=False> said Uncle Bletherthwaite, “is no excuse for this unwarrantable intrusion into the midst of a family gathering. This young person—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020957"><said direct=True>“A member of the family gathering,”</said><said direct=False> I urged.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020958"><said direct=False>Then Yolande detached herself from me, gave her face a final scrub, and spoke sweetly: “Oh, please don't be alarmed. There were some pails of red stuff put aside for the fruit trees, and this gentleman, who lives next door, unfortunately came in contact with them; and I had remembered the pails were there, and was just going to attend to them” (“In that dress!” said Aunt George, with a sniff), “and I brought him in to be washed. I think I myself will also wash. Good-night. I am so sorry to have alarmed you.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020959"><said direct=False>She passed the cordon of relations and fled, her last words a whisper to me:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020960"><said direct=True>“Their carriages are beginning to come. Leave Chloe to get rid of them. That man must be washed, or he'</said><said direct=False>ll die or be blind, or something.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020961"><said direct=False>So I took him to the bath-room and left him with the hot tap and the cold tap, and the hip-bath and the foot-bath and the long bath, and the hand-basin and the soap and a pile of towels, and some clothes of mine. And all seemed inadequate. I did not believe he would ever be his right color again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020962"><said direct=False>Then, Heaven be praised! there were cabs and trains, and the house-warming party melted away, Aunt George protesting to the last against Yolande's explanation as a mere excuse for “goings-on,” and Uncle Bletherthwaite feverishly anxious, even through the cab window, as to the nature of the crimson dressing designed for our fruit trees. At long last the last lingering cab-borne cousin left our gates, and Chloe and I turned to each other in the empty hall. A pale and cautious Yolande in a white wrapper peered down the stairs.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020963"><said direct=True>“Are they gone? Oh, give him lemons—many lemons; I'</said><said direct=False>ve got it all off my face with that. My hands are past praying for.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020964"><said direct=False>Our strangely introduced guest was still splashing and laughing and—well, grumbling—to himself over the lemons when Yolande rejoined us in the drawing-room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020965"><said direct=True>“He'</said><said direct=False>ll be ages yet,” she said. “You don't know what it is to get off. And he's simply soaked through and through.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020966"><said direct=True>“Yolande,”</said><said direct=False> I said, sternly, “I have borne enough; this ensanguined masquerade requires, as Uncle Bletherthwaite says, some explanation more convincing—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020967"><said direct=True>“Oh, bother!”</said><said direct=False> she cried. “I am a dog, and an outcast, and an abject idiot—and I'll tell you everything.” She fell a dejected heap into the easy-chair where Aunt George had sat so upright during the minuet and the cachucha. “I know you'll scorn me forever. But ‘a fault that's owned is half atoned,’ and I'll own my fault. It was only my only and always fault—I have but the one, you know—being too jolly clever by half. I'll never try to do anything again.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Oh, bother!” she cried. “I am a dog, and an outcast, and an abject idiot</said><said direct=True>—and I'll tell you everything.” She fell a dejected heap into the easy-chair where Aunt George had sat so upright during the minuet and the cachucha. “I know you'll scorn me forever.

I'll never try to do anything again.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020968"><said direct=True>“Tell us quickly, before he gets clean,”</said><said direct=False> Chloe pleaded. “Who is he? What was it? How did it happen? Quick—before he bursts upon us with his clean face.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020969"><said direct=True>“There'</said><said direct=False>s no hurry,” said Yolande, gloomily, twisting her reddened fingers tightly together. “You needn't be afraid of seeing his face clean yet awhile. Well, when you talked about the fruit-thief, I thought to myself, if one could only mark the thief thoroughly, it would be as good as catching him, because you could wire to all the police stations, ‘Lost, Stolen, or Strayed, a Pink-spotted Fruit-stealer!’ I thought I was quite clever, and really I was a mere lunatic.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020970"><said direct=False>I had never seen Yolande so near tears.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020971"><said direct=True>“It was a good idea,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, perfunctorily sympathetic; “and so you took that pink dye—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020973"><said direct=False>“Yes. I hid two pails of it, one among the currant-bushes and one under the quince-tree. And then when we were in the garden I saw a flash, and I knew some one had struck a match—to see where the peaches were, I thought. Really, of course, it must have been this wretched man lighting his hateful pipe. So I stole away, and I got the big brass garden syringe.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020974"><said direct=True>“It was a good idea,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, with more conviction. “Well?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020975"><said direct=True>“Well—oh, then I stalked him; and even when I was close to him I never knew he was just a human being in flannels. I thought he was playing ghost, and I said to myself, ‘</said><said direct=False>All the better to mark you on, my friend!’ Oh, it was funny.” She began to laugh shakily. “There was I creeping along with my syringe full charged, and the pail in my other hand—held well out, because of my gown—and he, poor soul, sauntering along in the shadows of the nut-walk, thinking nothing less than that some one was advancing with his pink doom. When he was a couple of yards off I fired a volley—slap in his face—and turned to run. He swore—but I forgive him that. My pail caught in a bough, and went over his feet, for he jumped towards the noise; he is not a coward. He caught hold of my dress, in the dark (he's torn a yard out at the gathers, but it doesn't matter; the dress was ruined anyway), and as soon as I had heard his voice, even though it was swearing—I knew what I'd done, and I said: ‘It's all a mistake. I'm Yolande Riseborough. Can't you see?’ for he was staggering about. And then I saw he couldn't, and I said: ‘Come and be cleaned. Give me your hand.’ And so I brought him in, and on the way we tumbled over the other pail. And nous voici—”</said></p>

<p n="ENG19020976"><said direct=False>“You know him, then?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020977"><said direct=True>“Know him? Any one would have known him, when it was too late. Oh, my broken heart! What will you do to me when you know? He'</said><said direct=False>ll never stay—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020978"><said direct=False>“If you play at sphinxes another moment I shall slap you. Who is it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020979"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s your new tenant. That's all,” said Yolande, with what is termed the calmness of despair. “You know, permission to walk in the garden was given as one of the extra attractions of the cottage. I'll never try to be clever again. I got you the tenant—cotton-broking lineage, and Coutts's bank, and all—and now I've squirted him with red dye out of a brass garden syringe, and he will never forgive it; and I wish I was dead.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It's your new tenant. That's all,” said Yolande, with what is termed the calmness of despair. “You know, permission to walk in the garden was given as one of the extra attractions of the cottage. I'll never try to be clever again.

<p n="ENG19020980"><said direct=False>One on each side of her, we were doing our best to console, when the bath-room door opened. We heard it. I flew into the corridor, pushed by four fair hands. I intercepted my partially washed tenant. I made him a speech of manly apology. Important as his tenancy was to me, I did not, even then, grovel before him. I was getting on fairly well with the speech when my tenant began to laugh—one of the jolliest laughs I ever heard. And from the drawing-room Chloe's laugh and Yolande's joined in it. So that in a few moments I had presented my tenant to my wife, and we were all talking at once, explaining and expounding, while I struggled with the wire of the last but two of the bottles of Asti.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020981"><said direct=False>My tenant was young; Chloe considered him handsome. He certainly had a well-shaped head and extremely merry blue eyes. He was at home with us at once. Stiffness of demeanor is difficult to maintain in the immediate sequence of events such as had introduced us.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020982"><said direct=False>Three courses were open to him, as Mr. Gladstone used to say. He might have stormed, raged, threatened, and retired; he might have retired, frigidly polite; in either case following up the retirement by a notice of the termination of the tenancy. Or he might have laughed and made the best of it, and of us. This he had done. I liked the man, and I almost forgave him for being able to play the guitar—a most effeminate accomplishment, and one I never could acquire, for all Chloe's teaching—when I heard that he had learned it in the Philippines during the war. I detest and distrust sudden intimacies, but it was impossible to treat this man as a stranger. By dyeing—or being accessory to the dyeing of—a new acquaintance crimson, you skip a hundred mile-stones on the road to friendship. But it might be a hazardous experiment. Anyway, it was not till the small hours were growing out of all knowledge, and beginning to take notice, that we parted from our tenant. A second, and much better, supper had risen for us, phœnix-like, from the ashes of the first; we had sung songs, told travellers' tales, made jokes, and when at last I saw the injured tenant to his door there were hints of gray in the east.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020983"><said direct=False>When I came back, Chloe and Yolande, candle-bearing, had paused on the stairs for a last word.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020984"><said direct=True>“He'</said><said direct=False>s wonderful,” I said. “The right sort.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020985"><said direct=True>“One of our kind—yes,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe; “some people are, don't you know, and some aren't; quite nice people, too, sometimes, curiously enough. And people who aren't very clever are, now and then. Besides that, he's charming—isn't he, Yolande?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020986"><said direct=False>Yolande stifled a yawn, and said she supposed he was all right.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020987"><said direct=True>“What a night of adventures for us!”</said><said direct=False> I said, “and, oh, my only hat! what a night for him!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020988"><said direct=True>“He may think himself lucky,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande. “How angel-good you were to him, Chloe! Goodnight.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020989"><said direct=True>“Do you think it was a success—the real party?”</said><said direct=False> asked Chloe, anxiously. “They couldn't believe that about the fruit and the dye.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020990"><said direct=True>“It was true,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, “so I suppose they couldn't. Oh yes, it's all right; give them something to talk about for months. It was a splendid party, Chloe, though I didn't have anything to do with it. I'll never put my finger into any one else's pie again!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020991"><said direct=False>She held up her pink-dyed fingers with a rather rueful laugh.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020992"><said direct=True>“Oh yes, you will,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “for the pie's our good! You see, this was such a very pink pie—and, besides, it was just that sort of an unimportant detail that doesn't suit your genius. But it's taught—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Oh yes, you will,” I said, “for the pie's our good! You see, this was such a very pink pie</said><said direct=True>—and, besides, it was just that sort of an unimportant detail that doesn't suit your genius. But it's taught—</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020993"><said direct=False>“Taught me a lesson? Yes, rub it in!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020994"><said direct=True>“No; it'</said><said direct=False>s taught us our tenant. I think he's worth learning. I'm glad we know him. Goodnight.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020995"><said direct=False>So ended our house-warming.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020996"><said direct=False>It was an extravagant entertainment, but the thought of the new tenant's rent upheld us through the gloomy work of paying the bills; and the price for my stories, as for Chloe's pictures, was rising steadily. I now had only to begin a story, and, if Yolande were staying with us, it found itself finished, and finished well, without my help. And I could not disguise from myself that my stories met now with a reception far more flattering than ever awaited them in the old days. My articles I was still allowed to write on “my own unaided hook,” and I rejoiced in this till the editor of the Weekly Wilderness sent me an amiable letter congratulating me on the style of certain tales which he had had the pleasure of reading in the magazines and weeklies, over my signature, and suggesting that my articles would be none the worse for a little of the “pathetic sort of thing” as well as the “light ironic touch” which he had noticed in the stories. Then I showed Chloe the letter, and said several things. Among others I swore that I would not be interfered with any more in my work.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020997"><said direct=True>“I know she means it kindly,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “I know it's done entirely to serve us and help us, and it's most kind and charitable, and I simply won't stand it. I'm not going to go on being complimented on other people's work.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020998"><said direct=False>Chloe was turning over the pages of the paper in which the last but three of these stories had appeared. “But they're good, aren't they—rather good, I mean?” said she.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020999"><said direct=True>“They'</said><said direct=False>re so beastly good,” said I, “that I won't put my name to another of them. If it weren't that the whole business sounds so silly, I'd tell every single editor to-morrow, and advertise the facts in the Times as well.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201000"><said direct=False>Chloe had grown quite pale.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201001"><said direct=True>“Oh, Len, don'</said><said direct=False>t!” she said; “the ghost only wants to help.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201002"><said direct=False>“Yolande—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201003"><said direct=True>“Yolande will be off to Italy quite soon now, with her horrid pupils. Len, dear, to please me, don'</said><said direct=False>t make any more fuss. You don't know how unhappy it makes me. Wait till she's gone. Perhaps the ghost won't write any more, now it knows you don't like it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201004"><said direct=True>“You mean you'</said><said direct=False>ll tell her to drop it?” said I. “What must she think of me for letting it go on so long? Well, my mind's made up now; I'll speak to Yolande myself—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201005"><said direct=True>“No, no, no! Dear Len, don'</said><said direct=False>t. I'm sure the ghost won't write any more. And I can't think why you mind. Yes—I see you do—and—But I'm quite pleased when the ghost touches up my drawings, or even when it does them for me altogether. Dear ghost! Len, it doesn't matter which of us does the work.” Her voice was very small, and broken, and I felt a brute.</said></p>
<said direct=False>“No, no, no! Dear Len, don't. I'm sure the ghost won't write any more. And I can't think why you mind. Yes</said><said direct=True>—I see you do—</said><said direct=False>and—But I'm quite pleased when the ghost touches up my drawings, or even when it does them for me altogether. Dear ghost! Len, it doesn't matter which of us does the work.” Her voice was very small, and broken, and I felt a brute.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201006"><said direct=True>“It wouldn'</said><said direct=False>t matter which of us did the work, my pussy-kitten,” I said, “but Yolande's not one of us. She's our land-agent and our registry-office, as it is, and that ought to be enough even for her. If you don't speak to her, I shall.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201007"><said direct=True>“Then I will,”</said><said direct=False> said she, turning away. “Go on with your work. I'm certain no nasty ghost will come and interfere any more.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201008"><said direct=False>Still raging, I sat down to the type-writer and snapped off a letter to my Weekly Wilderness editor. Then of course I went to look for Chloe. I found her crouched among the blue and green cushions on the faded green divan in the loafery, and I stayed there with her head on my shoulder till she had consented to be completely comforted. I told her that I “did not mean to be cross,” and when I had said it many times she believed it, and so did I, though it was not at all true.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201009"><said direct=False>After that no ghost ever laid finger on my type-writer, and I worked at it harder than ever. And my stories were not nearly so good as the ghost-ridden ones. But my drawings grew better and better, as I did more and more of them—all of which Chloe signed and sent off with a cheerful gratitude, perhaps a little too pronounced, and designed, I knew, to show me that she wasn't too proud to accept help from a ghost—or a friend.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201010"><said direct=False>The humiliation which stung me every time I thought of my indebtedness to a writer more expert than I drove me to this curious retaliation in Fate—or Chloe—or Yolande—or the ghost. Since Chloe could bear that my work should be supplemented and improved by another hand—a hand neither hers nor mine—it pleased me mightily to reflect that no hand but mine had ever tampered with her work, and that she did not know to whom belonged the hand whose help she accepted so lightly. I hugged myself in the knowledge that it was mine, mine, mine. An order to illustrate a child's book had thrilled her with delight. She has a pretty fancy. She can see pictures—but she cannot draw them. It was on her sketches that I always worked; and I worked hard to finish that child's book before Yolande should take flight for Italy. I found it hard to conceal from Yolande my growing irritation at the ghost's part in my stories—an irritation doubled, of course, by vexation at the weakness of my former acquiescence. It was hard to keep the word I had pledged to Chloe, hard not to have it out with Yolande. There would, I think, have been a constraint strong enough to force on a crisis of explanations but for our new tenant. He distracted us.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201011"><said direct=False>He called on us; he invited us to tea; he sent us tickets for the theatres. When I saw him strolling among the green of our garden—for he spent most of the time there that he could snatch from his newspaper-office—I sometimes hated to think that our garden was no longer only our own; but he was discreet. If Chloe and I set foot in the garden, he disappeared, as swiftly as though our weed-grown walks had been a wishing-carpet. But when Yolande walked alone in the garden he sometimes joined her. Of course to her the garden was merely a green space to walk in. To us—and I liked our tenant for perceiving this—the garden was something far other and far more. He dined with us—on a bottled-beer footing—more than once, and more than once we and Yolande dined with him at his cottage. On the first of these times Chloe and I could not help exchanging glances when we saw how the soft yellow of our tenant's sitting-room wall-paper suited his black-framed etchings and mezzotints. Yolande surprised the glance, and it betrayed us to her. She taxed us roundly with the crime, later on, as we sat sipping cocoa round the kitchen fire at home.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201012"><said direct=True>“When will you learn wisdom?”</said><said direct=False> she sighed. “You know you papered that cottage yourselves.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201013"><said direct=False>We owned it shamefacedly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201014"><said direct=False>“Are there no poor paper-hangers out of work? I ask more in sorrow than in anger. Are there no painters in Elmhurst?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201015"><said direct=False>Here Chloe plucked up a spirit and said we enjoyed doing it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201016"><said direct=True>“The old defence—which is none,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, setting down her cup on the broad fender. “How many glorious golden guineas could you two have turned at your own trades in the time it took you to do that house? Oh yes, I saw the exquisite way you'd made the patterns match, and how delicately you'd negotiated all those difficult odd corners. You are incorrigible!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201017"><said direct=True>“It comes of property,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Our property is exigent. We love it, and it presumes on our affection and makes us do things for it. It's like doing things for one's own child. Mothers like to wash and dress their own babies, and they don't think it waste of time to spend hours over it—even if they might be earning money instead and keeping whole armies of competent professional nurses. Now your property—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It comes of property,” I said. “Our property is exigent. We love it, and it presumes on our affection and makes us do things for it. It's like doing things for one's own child. Mothers like to wash and dress their own babies, and they don't think it waste of time to spend hours over it</said><said direct=True>—even if they might be earning money instead and keeping whole armies of competent professional nurses. Now your property—</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201018"><said direct=True>“Yes, I know,”</said><said direct=False> Yolande interrupted; “my property's in consols—what there is of it—and I love it for itself alone. It has no sentimental claims. Don't throw it up at me. But even if I had a house and a garden and cottages and all the rest of it—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Yes, I know,” Yolande interrupted; “my property's in consols</said><said direct=True>—what there is of it—</said><said direct=False>and I love it for itself alone. It has no sentimental claims. Don't throw it up at me. But even if I had a house and a garden and cottages and all the rest of it—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201019"><said direct=True>“If you had a husband,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, looking up suddenly from the red heart of the fire at which she had been blinking, “wouldn't you like to sew on his buttons and mend his socks?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201020"><said direct=True>“Never,”</said><said direct=False> cried Yolande, with energy. “You can get them done for a penny a pair, and men ought to sew on their own buttons—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201021"><said direct=False>We laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201022"><said direct=False>“He may divert his energies so far?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201023"><said direct=True>“Yes; it'</said><said direct=False>s good for a man, because he never does it—or he never does it because it's good for him.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201024"><said direct=True>“Pardon me,”</said><said direct=False> I said, firmly. “I myself—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201025"><said direct=True>“Oh, you!”</said><said direct=False> she said; “but I am sleepy and stupid, and I shall never be married and sit over my own kitchen fire. Good-night, Cinderella.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201026"><said direct=True>“Good-night, Fairy Godmother,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201027"><said direct=False>I handed Yolande her brass candlestick and went back to my wife and my own fireside. When we had sat silent for a little, listening to the slow ticking of the tall clock, Chloe said, still blinking at the fire:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201028"><said direct=False>“That was quite true—what you said about doing things for your own—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201029"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “I know it was.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201030"><said direct=False>“How can people let nurses do everything for their babies?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201031"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> I said again, “how can they?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201032"><said direct=False>Her cheek was against my shoulder by this time and my face against her hair. So we sat silent another space. Then suddenly she lifted her head and said, “Len, if she ever is married, she'll be just as silly as other people.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201033"><said direct=True>“Probably,”</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201034"><said direct=False>“I wonder if our tenant—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201035"><said direct=False>“Of course he admires her. We all do—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201036"><said direct=False>“Yes, but—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201037"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s absurd,” I said, with some heat, for which I can give no reason; “she hardly knows him at all.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201038"><said direct=True>“That doesn'</said><said direct=False>t matter,” said my wife. “Have you forgotten—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201039"><said direct=False>I had not forgotten. It is a joy to both of us still to remember how few times we had met before we knew, quite surely and without mistake, and so ran into each other's arms in the safe confidence and knowledge that there, for each, was the only possible home.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201040"><said direct=True>“But other people are different,”</said><said direct=False> I said, after a while.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201041"><said direct=True>“Not all of them—and not so very,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “And I think he likes her.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201042"><said direct=True>“Nonsense!”</said><said direct=False> I said; “and, besides, he's not half good enough for her.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201043"><said direct=True>“I knew you'</said><said direct=False>d say that,” she cried, jumping up. “No, I'm not going to sit on your knee another moment.” She busied herself in lighting our candle. “I knew you'd say that. Isn't it odd? Women are so glad to think of their friends being perhaps going to be happy. But men always feel injured at the mere idea that a girl they like might marry some one else. Dogs in the manger!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201044"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s not the polygamous instinct at all, my pussy-kitten,” I said. “It's only that women believe in marriage, and men don't.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201045"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t they?” said she. “Don't you?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201046"><said direct=True>“But our marriage isn'</said><said direct=False>t at all like other marriages. Now, is it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201047"><said direct=True>“Isn'</said><said direct=False>t it? Oh, I hope it is! I shouldn't like to think ours was the only proper marriage. It can't be, of course. There must be heaps of people as fond of each other as we are. Don't you think so? And quite as happy.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201048"><said direct=True>“Do you think so?”</said><said direct=False> She had lighted the candle and was standing looking at me as I took off my boots. I stood up in my stockinged feet and put my arm round her. “Do you?” I asked again.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201049"><said direct=True>“No,”</said><said direct=False> she said, beginning to smile and blinking softly at me, “honestly, I'm afraid I don't.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201050"><said direct=True>“And I don'</said><said direct=False>t, either,” said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201051"><said direct=False>I HAVE been writing like a man milliner. I have found no manly tale to set forth—only a record of domesticity almost florid in its decorative detail. Let the accomplished specialist in obscure psychology seek, and find if he can, the reason. For me, let me only say that had Chloe written it the tale had been far otherwise. Chloe would have dwelt, at strenuous length, on my encounter with the coal-man who refused to carry sacks down our cellar stairs. Had he contented himself with a courteous refusal, my sympathies, I own, would have been with him, for the stairs are mediæval in their uncompromising inconvenience, their gratuitous dangerousness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201052"><said direct=False>But the coal-man did not stop at that, and when I came on the scene Chloe, with tears of pure rage in her eyes, and in the low, sweet voice that is always lowest and sweetest when she is most furious, was ordering him out. And he was explaining, in detail, what he would be if he would go before he was ready. So I turned him out. Chloe would have made an epic of this.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201053"><said direct=False>I suppose cutting down dead trees is manly work, and I certainly did that. Also I sawed them into lengths proportioned to the wood-basket. But Chloe always sat on the bough to keep it steady, so sawing cannot count as mere man's work. Rabbit-catching sounds manly enough, but Chloe was in that too, more or less. The incident which led to the rabbiting was, however, my show entirely, and I confess to a certain pride in it. My presence of mind, as well as my dramatic ability, was called into play, and I was pleased with myself on both counts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201054"><said direct=False>I was wandering in the orchard at dusk one evening, pushing through the long grass and nettles, and trying to fix in my memory the way of the growing of apple-boughs for the ghost's next illustration. The mists of October drifted like wraiths among the trees, and the scent of wet earth had mingled with itself the perfume of sadness and regret and memory. In spring the wet earth smells of hope and joy and the green future. I had stood in contemplation for some moments before the golden-pippin tree, and was really beginning to know its gnarled face by heart, when I heard a scratch and a squeak, and a voice said, “Got 'im!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201055"><said direct=False>I moved cautiously round my tree. In the open space beyond the orchard the wild rabbits have made their burrows, and here, grouped round one of the rabbit-holes, were two men, three dogs, a boy, and several ferrets—the last in bags.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201056"><said direct=False>I was still unseen. I reflected. If I called on these rabbit-thieves to surrender, they would probably decline to do so on any terms. Indeed, why should they? There were six of them, not counting the ferrets, and I was only one. That was the point. If I had only been three—or even two! Could I not be two, or even three? How could it be done? Arithmetic is a difficult branch of science. I reflected again. The men had killed the rabbit, replaced the net over the hole, and resumed their several stations at the mouths of other burrows. The dusk was falling fast. I crept away for a dozen yards. Then, assuming the gruffest voice at my command, and rolling my r's to the highest pitch, I cried out: “George! Fred! Dick!” and faintly answering in a tone I hoped would seem to come from a distance, I voiced a couple of shrill, “Yes, sirs”; then with my stick I beat madly on the underbushes and, rushing forward, shouted in the voice of my uncle's old Scotch gardener:</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG19020522"><said direct=True>“Dear sir,”</said><said direct=False> it said, “your story, ‘The Return,’ to hand. It is quite satisfactory, and if you care to supply a series of six, in the same style, we could, I think, find room for them in the magazine during next year.” The editor said something vague but pleasant about terms, and added that he was faithfully mine, and the letter concluded with the name of a very lucky man.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020523"><said direct=True>“It is my name at the foot,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “This piece of luck has happened to me! It ought to have been addressed to Messrs. Ghost & Co., oughtn't it? Aid me, ye powers! Six stories!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020524"><said direct=True>“In the same style,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, getting up from the tea-tray and coming behind me to pull my ears in sheer gladness of heart. “Are you going to imitate the ghost's style, Len?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020525"><said direct=False>I did not answer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020526"><said direct=False>She rested her chin on my shoulder.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020527"><said direct=True>“Of course you write much better than the ghost,”</said><said direct=False> she said, hastily; “but he does say the same style.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020528"><said direct=True>“I have written stories before—and I can do it again, I suppose,”</said><said direct=False> said I. “I only happened to get stuck with that story. I should have finished it all right if the ghost hadn't interfered. I wish to goodness she'd let it alone!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020529"><said direct=False>Chloe took her chin from my shoulder and went back to the tea-tray.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020530"><said direct=True>“Will you have another cup?”</said><said direct=False> she said, coldly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020531"><said direct=True>“What'</said><said direct=False>s the matter?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020532"><said direct=False>She did not answer.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020533"><said direct=False>Then I caught at my lost temper and secured it. I laughed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020534"><said direct=True>“What!”</said><said direct=False> I said, “take part with a nasty, stuck-up ghost against your own husband—so talented, yet so modest? If I am to have a rival, let it be flesh and blood, and not a ghost whose head I cannot punch, whose back I cannot horsewhip!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020535"><said direct=True>“Well, then,”</said><said direct=False> she said, trying to balance a teaspoon on the milk-jug, “I think the ghost only meant to be kind, and I don't like to hear you speak as if you thought it had no business to interfere.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020536"><said direct=True>“I see,”</said><said direct=False> I said, slowly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020537"><said direct=False>She flashed a quick glance at me. “Yes,” she said, “I see you see. Here's luck to the six stories!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020538"><said direct=False>It was in the morning after one of Mary's evenings out that she came to Chloe and said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020539"><said direct=False>“Please, mum, are those your cottages along by the garden wall?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020540"><said direct=False>Chloe smiled, scenting another tenant.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020541"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> she said. “Do you know any one—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020542"><said direct=True>“Well, mum,”</said><said direct=False> said Mary, “I think it's no more but right that you should know it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020543"><said direct=False>Chloe said, “What?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020544"><said direct=False>Mary replied: “Why, their goings-on! I see him last night, as I come in, as drunk as drunk, lying all over the front garden, and I went down this morning to have another look.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020545"><said direct=True>“And was he still there—all over the front garden?”</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020546"><said direct=True>“No, sir, not him, but everything else you can think of. But I won'</said><said direct=False>t say not a word more, sir; but it's not respectable, and I thought you ought to know, sir. You're that innocent, sir, if you'll excuse me saying so. I know you won't believe no harm of any one till you have caught 'em at it. You just go and look, sir, that's all.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020547"><said direct=False>Chloe and I walked down the garden path, hand in hand, in agitated silence. Not till we were safe hidden under the twisted quince-tree did we dare to look at each other. Then we sat down in the long grass expressly to laugh at our ease.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020548"><said direct=True>“And the worst of it is it'</said><said direct=False>s true,” Chloe said. “You are innocent. No—don't be offended. I'm afraid I am, too. We are Babes in the Wood, Len, just as Yolande said, and Mary has the sense to see it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020549"><said direct=False>I murmured something about references.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020550"><said direct=True>“Yes, I know you said so, and I know it'</said><said direct=False>s my fault; but other things are yours. You are innocent. Don't deny it. Oh, Len, we ought to be living in a villa, and paying proper little calls, and giving proper little dinners, and decorating our dinner-table with proper little cut flowers in proper little cut-glass vases; and when we dined alone the fishmonger would send in two proper little whitings with their proper little tails in their mouths; and we should have roast chicken, and it would be minced the next day, and everything would go by dull, beautiful, proper little clock-work; and you would say what a good manager I was, because we neither of us should have any idea what good management really meant. We're failures, Len. We haven't the wit to run a great estate.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020551"><said direct=True>“In fact,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “we've bitten off a larger chunk than we can chew.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020552"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t be vulgar!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020553"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m not—I'm trying to be American.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020554"><said direct=True>“You'</said><said direct=False>re not succeeding. They don't talk like that. I knew an American once. He was the nicest—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020555"><said direct=True>“I know. He thought you were the nicest. Why didn'</said><said direct=False>t you marry him?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020556"><said direct=True>“Because he was rich, and it'</said><said direct=False>s my destiny to ruin a poor man. Len, I wish I wasn't such an idiot!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020557"><said direct=True>“Or that I wasn'</said><said direct=False>t. That would do just as well. But don't let's weep about it yet. Perhaps Mary exaggerated. Our tenant may merely have been in a fit. No known system of manorial management can avert fits among the tenantry.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020558"><said direct=True>“But she said, ‘</said><said direct=False>You go and look, that's all!’”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020559"><said direct=True>“Well,”</said><said direct=False> said I, rising, “I will go and look. Will you come?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020560"><said direct=True>“No,”</said><said direct=False> said she. “I'm frightened. Yes, I will, of course.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020561"><said direct=False>And we went.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020562"><said direct=False>Outside the red wall of our garden is a strip of ground bounded by a hawthorn hedge, and at the end of this stand the two cottages. We passed along the winding shrubbery-walk—by reason of its darkness the only path of our garden whereon the weeds were not breast-high—and so, pushing through the tall-standing weeds, dock and nettle, sow-thistle and cow-parsley, of the cottage garden, to the square of ground that stands between our two cottages and the road. Here were no juicy, green, upstanding weeds, graceful in their arrogant victory over flowers and fruits. The green weeds were trampled down to a damp, yellow, sodden mass, sordid and evilsmelling. Old meat-cans, sardine-tins, broken boots, decayed brooms, and battered saucepans were strewn around, “like flowers at a festival.” Dirty rags festooned the faded blue of the railings; the family linen, wetted but not washed, hung on the elder-bushes, whose white blossoms drooped degraded under the foul burden. A very dirty blanket hung out of the bedroom window, and on the doorstep, among dust and flue, bones, crusts, and the miscellaneous sweepings of a filthy floor, three indescribably unengaging children, with dirty noses, were playing moodily and without smiles. Their playthings were a blade-bone of mutton, two muddy clothes-pegs, and a dead mouse.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020563"><said direct=False>Chloe is absurdly fond of children, but—or, perhaps, therefore—she turned away with a shudder. We went home boiling with indignation, but in the crucible of our thought our rage, as it cooled, left as precipitate the unmistakable consciousness of our own incompetence. True, as Chloe said, it was she who had accepted a tenant so manifestly undesirable—lured by a bait of fourteen shillings a month. She had done it, but I had stood by and let it be done. Now, however, I must act. I would act. Was it, I wonder, an inexcusable cowardice or a wise discretion which led me to refrain from giving Mr. Prosser notice in a personal interview? I wrote to him, and bade him leave my cottage at the end of the week. But at the end of the week he was still there, and on the Monday evening, as Chloe and I wandered in the green forest of weeds and flowers that was our garden, the spell of its silence was broken for us by the sound of Mr. Prosser's voice, uplifted in one of the less agreeable comic songs of the year before the year before last.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020564"><said direct=False>I went down at once to give him, personally, that notice to quit which I found him in no fit state to receive. Another call, in the morning, found my tenant conscious, indeed, but little amenable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020565"><said direct=True>“I gave you written notice to quit last week,”</said><said direct=False> said I. “How is it you've not gone?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020566"><said direct=False>Mr. Prosser, unshaved, without tie, collar, or boots, settled his head between his shoulders, and said he didn't know anything about no notice.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020567"><said direct=True>“Well, anyhow,”</said><said direct=False> said I, “you've got to clear out now. I want the cottage.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020568"><said direct=True>“Right you are, sir,”</said><said direct=False> said he, “but there must be proper notice give an' took.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020569"><said direct=True>“I give you notice now,”</said><said direct=False> said I, “and, while I am here, suppose you hand over the rent.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020570"><said direct=False>Then my tenant drew himself up and uttered these memorable words:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020571"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m a yearly tenant, I am, and I pays on quarter-day, and six months' notice is what I'm entitled to. ‘Nine pun two a year,’ your missus said.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020572"><said direct=True>“Very well. I shall consult my solicitor,”</said><said direct=False> I said, and turned away helpless. I didn't know—how should I, though I had kicked my heels, briefless, in the Inner Temple for at least two years—whether he was entitled to that or anything else.</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Very well. I shall consult my solicitor,” I said, and turned away helpless. I didn't know</said><said direct=True>—how should I, though I had kicked my heels, briefless, in the Inner Temple for at least two years—</said><said direct=False>whether he was entitled to that or anything else.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020573"><said direct=False>I wrote to my solicitor. I had never had a solicitor before, but I acquired one at once— an old chum. He wrote me three pages of advice, in which a writ of ejectment loomed large. But his private opinion, as I read it between the lines, seemed to be that I had got myself into a tight place by my own folly, and had better trust to time to get me out of it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020574"><said direct=False>Our garden's peace was broken. We never knew now when the hoarse, raucous voice of our tenant might desecrate the moonlit stillness with coarse echoes of transpontine musichalls. The knowledge of Mr. Prosser's nearness seemed to smirch the clean sweetness of life. The very jasmine stars seemed less white for the presence of our tenant's sordid ménage on the other side of our red wall. And Mary, day by day, tormented us with fresh tales of what was being said in the village of our tenant's antecedents and character, and, by implication, of ours. And all the time my inability to set steadfastly to work was fretting at my self-control. It is like a mouse gnawing at the cord of life—the longing to work, and the inability to conquer the thousand tiny obstacles that fate erects—fate, backed by one's own folly in having “bitten off a larger chunk than one can chew”;—I still think that a most excellent phrase, and not vulgar, only homely, going straight to the mark as the homely expression of a great truth may be permitted to do. Chloe was worried also—her editors were clamoring for the illustrations which she was now incapable of working at. And Mr. Prosser was a live blister, and, like a blister, he hurt more and more the longer we had to bear with him.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020575"><said direct=False>I was sitting in our little work-room one morning, pen in hand, hardly able to meet with a confident eye the white paper that, as I stared at it, seemed to stare at me in return—to stare rudely, contemptuously, in the confident superiority of its fulfilment of its destiny, as opposed to my manifest inability to fulfil mine. It was waiting to be written on, and no one could ask more of it. And I was waiting to write on it; and a good deal more than mere waiting was obviously demanded of me by our financial circumstances and my own self-respect. The six stories—“in the style of the ghost”—I longed to get them written with a longing more desperate than the longing of the lover for his mistress, the mother for her child. Though more desperate, it had not, however, the force of these natural desires, because it was not a desire for the thing in itself—not a desire to achieve, to attain—but depended for its vitality on a secondary motive. I longed to write the stories because I wanted the money they would bring to me. The longing was keen enough to be painful, not strong enough to get itself satisfied. So I sat idle, and drew fancy portraits of Chloe on the blotting-paper. I turned it over hastily as I heard her footstep on the kitchen floor, and I was bending over a virgin quarto page rimmed with unsoiled pink when she came in.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020576"><said direct=False>I drew my breath in sharply. Her face, her eyes, her whole bearing announced disaster unspeakable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020577"><said direct=True>“What is it?”</said><said direct=False> I cried, and I am sure I must have turned pale.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020578"><said direct=True>“Len, do you love me?”</said><said direct=False> she asked, clasping her hands with a charming dramatic movement.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020579"><said direct=True>“Better than my life, of course,”</said><said direct=False> I said, hurriedly, “but I'm just starting on this story, and if it's some domestic detail—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020580"><said direct=True>“No, it can'</said><said direct=False>t wait,” said she, sitting down on the edge of the table, “and it's not a variation on the domestic theme. It's the theme itself. Len—it's all over!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020581"><said direct=True>“What'</said><said direct=False>s all over?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020582"><said direct=True>“Everything. She'</said><said direct=False>s going to leave.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020583"><said direct=False>“Why?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020584"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know. I was too upset to ask her. I just came to you.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020585"><said direct=False>I resisted an impulse to put aside the six remunerative munerative stories and spend the rest of the day in consoling my wife.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020586"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know what it is. We've been nice to her, I'm sure! She likes us—at least I thought she did. It's Destiny—it's like Maeterlinck—whatever we do turns out all anyhow. There's a curse upon us!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I don't know what it is. We've been nice to her, I'm sure! She likes us</said><said direct=True>—at least I thought she did. It's Destiny—</said><said direct=False>it's like Maeterlinck—whatever we do turns out all anyhow. There's a curse upon us!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020587"><said direct=True>“Speak for yourself,”</said><said direct=False> I said, cheerfully. “You may be cursed, though it's barely polite of you to say so, but I am blessed above all that live, I'm blessed if I'm not—since you—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Speak for yourself,” I said, cheerfully. “You may be cursed, though it's barely polite of you to say so, but I am blessed above all that live, I'm blessed if I'm not</said><said direct=True>—since you—</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020588"><said direct=False>She stamped her foot. “Don't you see,” she said, “it's serious, horribly serious? I wish I had never come here. I wish we were back in the Bandbox—there! Now crow over me, and tell me you told me so all the time!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020589"><said direct=False>I told her something quite different, and presently, when we were calmer, I said,</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020590"><said direct=True>“At least we may as well know why she'</said><said direct=False>s going.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020591"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>ll ask her,” said Chloe, drying her eyes. “It's probably Prosser. If I were you I should just take him by the shoulders and turn him out. You're quite strong enough.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020592"><said direct=True>“Yes, and have an action for assault and a hundred pounds'</said><said direct=False> damages,” said I, wise with the wisdom of my solicitor. “Go and ask her. Perhaps it's not Prosser. Even he, fiend without out references as he is, can't be responsible for everything. Perhaps she's seen the ghost.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020593"><said direct=False>I had completed a fancy sketch of Mary giving notice, and alleging her reasons by unmistakable gestures indicating the ghost, in the background, when Chloe returned.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020594"><said direct=True>“Well?”</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020595"><said direct=True>“Well?”</said><said direct=False> said she.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020596"><said direct=False>“Have you found out?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020597"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s all right,” said Chloe, with a sigh of deep relief. “We haven't done anything. She is awfully fond of us—but she must go.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020598"><said direct=False>“Why?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020599"><said direct=True>“She'</said><said direct=False>s going to marry the baker.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020600"><said direct=False>“Lucky man!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020601"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s a love-affair,” said Chloe—“the prettiest story. They couldn't marry before because he wasn't well enough off, and now an uncle has left him some money, and he's bought a partnership.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020602"><said direct=False>“And how long have they been waiting for each other? How many long years of priceless constancy, tried like gold in the furnace?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020603"><said direct=True>“That'</said><said direct=False>s the worst of it,” said Chloe, blushing, as I live; “she's only known him for a month. But servants are expeditious as the wind in matters of the heart.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020604"><said direct=True>“Charles Reade: Hard Cash—yes. Well, it'</said><said direct=False>s hard on us.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020605"><said direct=True>“But it'</said><said direct=False>s very nice for them,” said my wife. “You ought to feel ever so much sympathy with lovers!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020606"><said direct=True>“I do,”</said><said direct=False> said I, “especially when they are married and live in a house miles too big for them.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020607"><said direct=True>“Oh, Len,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “are you really so very sorry for yourself?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020608"><said direct=False>“I am just as sorry for myself as you are for me.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020609"><said direct=True>“And I'</said><said direct=False>m just as sorry for you as you can possibly be for yourself. Where had we got to?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020610"><said direct=True>“We had got to Mary'</said><said direct=False>s marrying the baker, and your not minding being left without a servant because of your admiration for the beauty of constant love.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020611"><said direct=True>“Let'</said><said direct=False>s go into the garden and finish talking about it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020612"><said direct=True>“I could talk all day about love and constancy,”</said><said direct=False> said I, “but my story—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020613"><said direct=True>“Bother the story!”</said><said direct=False> said she, “and it's not love I want to talk about, unless you can't keep off the subject. It's advertisements, and registry-offices, and Prosser.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020614"><said direct=False>So we went into the garden and talked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020615"><said direct=False>The garden chooses one's subjects for one, and it would not listen to any of Chloe's subjects. It was more tolerant of mine.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020616"><said direct=False>I WAS writing in the red-and-white marble hall that morning—I really had made a beginning on the first of the six stories. It was not a good beginning, but there it was. I had reached page three, and knew that unless any domestic event more than commonly cataclysmic befell that day I should see the sun set on twelve pages of laborious type-writing.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020617"><said direct=False>The walls of the marble hall are thick, and the windows look to the northeast, so that even when the sun is turning the garden to fine gold, and the westerly rooms to a burning, fiery furnace, the hall remains cool as a cave. Through the open door I could see the feathery flowers of the Spanish chestnut; through one window I could see the copper-beech, wine-dark, and through the other a gap in the avenue showed me a square of blue sky backing a single pillar of Normandy poplar, straight, slender, self- possessed. The garden was full of bird noises and the faint rustle of leaves. In the kitchen sounded the clink of silver—of electro-plate, to be more accurate—and the chime of china. The tapping of my Remington hardly did more than underline a silence which it might have broken to an ear that loved its monotonous music less than did mine.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020618"><said direct=False>The hall is the great highway of the Red House. Chloe passed through now and then with duster and broom, with an armful of blue-frilled cushions, with a folded rug, with something that rattled in a covered waste-paper basket. She looked at me, and I knew she was wondering why I did not ask her what she was playing at. But I forbore, because I had reached the fourth page, and I dared not tempt fate by pausing to enjoy more deeply the charm of a life my right to which I ought, without doubt, even at that moment to be earning. Besides, I feared to break the spell. When once the fatal third page is passed fluency holds her own against ordinary attacks. Not against Chloe, if one allows her to begin to explain a new idea. Yet my fingers worked more slowly, and my full stops gave me time to count forty instead of four, as they tell us to do at school, just because I could not either resist or understand a growing impression pression that my wife did not want me to ask any questions. Had I felt that it would please her to be questioned. I could have wrestled with the definite temptation to please her, and have thrown it. As it was, my phrases grew feebler, my narrative less convincing. I had to clutch with both hands at my vanishing interest in my story; and when the struggle was over I found that I had complicated the career of my hero with two wives, a dissipated youth, and a proposed highway robbery. And my hero was intended to shine in a milieu of “strong domestic interest.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020619"><said direct=False>I gathered the pages together; it was lunchtime. The blue and gold of the morning were overclouded with thick gray; the sky looked like the canvas roof of a travelling-circus tent. A few first drops made splashes on the door-step big as five-shilling pieces. Then down came the rain—straight, strong, masterful.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020620"><said direct=True>“I knew it was going to rain,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “How good it is to hear it! Don't you feel almost as glad of it as if you were a tree? Fancy standing up to it and holding out all your leaves to feel the splash of it!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020621"><said direct=True>“It makes work easier,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Now you can't entice me away from my stories and tempt me to waste the golden hours in the garden.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020622"><said direct=True>“That'</said><said direct=False>s the worst of this house,” she said—“everything inside it urges to industry. The white parlor is so proper, I never sit in it without feeling that I ought to be doing open-work embroidery, if not working a sampler. What heaps of work we shall do in the winter when there's no dear garden to tempt us!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020623"><said direct=False>“I wonder—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020624"><said direct=False>It was Chloe who talked just then. I was trying to keep a few tentacles fixed on my story, and I was determined that I would ask no questions. After lunch I said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020625"><said direct=False>“Coffee?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020626"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s not ready yet,” said she, rising. Then, “Len,” she said, abruptly, “I've got something to show you.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020627"><said direct=True>“ Not more rabbits?”</said><said direct=False> I said, for only the week before it had been six baby rabbits that she had to show, found in our orchard, and painfully fed by Chloe, with the finger of a white kid glove dipped in warm milk. The rabbits had not lived.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020628"><said direct=False>“No, no—how can you remind me of that? Come.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020629"><said direct=False>She led me up the oak stairs, along the gallery, and up a further narrower flight. We were among the nest of deserted rooms on the second floor. Chloe threw open a door, pulled me through, and shut it quickly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020630"><said direct=False>It was a large room, swept and cleaned; three long windows, curtained with cascades of Virginia-creeper, filled it with soft green twilight.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020631"><said direct=False>There were no ornaments, there were no easy-chairs, there were no flowers and no carpets. Only one Persian rug on the floor, and a great divan, twelve or fourteen feet long, against one of the walls. On the shelves in the recesses by the fireplace were some thirty books, a large deal table held a solid inkstand, a smaller deal table held a brass tray with cups and tins. Two Windsor chairs stood against the big table.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020632"><said direct=True>“Now I'</said><said direct=False>ll make coffee,” she said, turning to the brass tray.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020633"><said direct=True>“Coffee seems very flat. Is it possible that you aren'</said><said direct=False>t going to satisfy my raging curiosity? What is this room?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020634"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s the loafery,” she said. “In the winter, as you say, we shall need a place to loaf in.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020635"><said direct=True>“I didn'</said><said direct=False>t say so.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020636"><said direct=False>“Yes, you did. Try the divan.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020637"><said direct=False>I did. It crackled when I sat down, but it was very comfortable.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020638"><said direct=True>“Chloe,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “come here!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020639"><said direct=True>“I can'</said><said direct=False>t. I'm making the coffee.” And indeed she had lighted the spirit-lamp to that end.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020640"><said direct=True>“Do you know that you are blushing as though you had been detected in pocket-picking, or in some generous act? Why are you embarrassed? Why are you shy? Why do you screen yourself behind a spirit-lamp? Why have you done this? And why don'</said><said direct=False>t you rush into my arms as a dutiful wife should, and confess how you came to have such a beautiful idea?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020641"><said direct=False>“You do like it, then?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020642"><said direct=False>“Like it? I protest, by all my household gods, that if I had been a bachelor inhabiting this house, thus, and in no other way, should I have furnished my living-room!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020643"><said direct=True>“Why ‘</said><said direct=False>if you were a bachelor’?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020644"><said direct=False>“Because my wife likes pretty things. She likes green Flemish pots, and brass warming-pans, and Sheffield-plate candlesticks, and flowers; and, as a husband, I like what she likes. Chloe, why are there no flowers here?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020645"><said direct=False>She pointed to the green screen of leaves at the window.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020646"><said direct=False>I got up and began to walk up and down.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020647"><said direct=True>“You'</said><said direct=False>re a witch,” said I. “How did you know exactly what I liked? Here is space—nothing to knock down! And form—no curtains to break the fine lines of these old windows. And color—look at the green light; it's like a fairy palace lighted by glowworm-lamps, especially when that gleam of sunlight came! Chloe, how did you know? Is it because you love me very much?”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“You're a witch,” said I. “How did you know exactly what I liked? Here is space</said><said direct=True>—nothing to knock down! And form—</said><said direct=False>no curtains to break the fine lines of these old windows. And color—look at the green light; it's like a fairy palace lighted by glowworm-lamps, especially when that gleam of sunlight came! Chloe, how did you know? Is it because you love me very much?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020648"><said direct=True>“Not in the least,”</said><said direct=False> she said, briskly. “It's because—Len, don't laugh at me—I knew how to do the room because it's what I like, too!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Not in the least,” she said, briskly. “It's because</said><said direct=True>—Len, don't laugh at me—</said><said direct=False>I knew how to do the room because it's what I like, too!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020649"><said direct=False>She had made the coffee and poured it out. Then she came and took my arm. Outside the rain pattered pleasantly on the green leaves and on the roof of the balcony.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020650"><said direct=True>“That'</said><said direct=False>s why I felt silly and why I blushed—only, of course, I never did blush. I seem to be turning into somebody else, and perhaps you won't like me so much. Or I'm half myself and half somebody else, and I don't know which half is really you. It didn't cost anything, hardly,” she went on, irrelevantly. “The divan is only orange-boxes filled with straw, and covered with those old green curtains—you know—the ones that were so faded. And the table is out of the kitchen—the two shelves that pull out are quite enough there, Mary says. And that's all.”</said></p>

<p n="ENG19020651"><said direct=False>We sat down among the blue-frilled cushions. “I bought the stuff for these, of course—the green twirlies on them just match the old curtains,” she said. “And that really is all.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020652"><said direct=True>“Honest Injun?”</said><said direct=False> I said, severely.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020653"><said direct=True>“Oh,”</said><said direct=False> she said, tossing her head, “if you think I really did it to please you—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020654"><said direct=True>“But tell me, then,”</said><said direct=False> I pleaded.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020655"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know,” she said, confusedly, resting her elbows on her knees and her head in her hands. “You see, the Red House is so big.

<p n="ENG19020660"><said direct=False>“Nothing?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020661"><said direct=False>“Only us. I wonder if you understand—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020662"><said direct=True>“My dear,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “we've tumbled out of our doll's house into the real world.”</said></p>

<said direct=False>“Into a new world, then—a world where we have to think for ourselves and judge things on their merits. We're like Columbus, madam.

<p n="ENG19020665"><said direct=True>“And the things one doesn'</said><said direct=False>t care about—those are much more important—the things one has just because other people have them—at least, if that's not the reason I don't know what is. And we've so much to learn, and there are so many good qualities I know nothing about. Don't you feel very poor and unimportant, Len? And very, very ignorant? I do.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“And the things one doesn't care about</said><said direct=True>—those are much more important—</said><said direct=False>the things one has just because other people have them—at least, if that's not the reason I don't know what is.

<p n="ENG19020666"><said direct=True>“I know one or two important things,”</said><said direct=False> said I, for I never encourage Chloe in the moods of humility that end in self-reproaches, “and I have one or two unimportant possessions—the Red House, and a wife, and a loafery. See, the sun is coming out in earnest; how glorious it is through the green! Oh, it's a good world, when all's said and done! How thick the creeper grows. What does it hang by? Why, there are bars! This must have been the nursery.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020667"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, leaning her chin on my shoulder, as she stood behind me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020668"><said direct=True>“It would make a splendid nursery, too,”</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020669"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> said my wife again, still with her chin on my shoulder. “Len, I feel very silly indeed, to-day; I should like to say something stupid.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020670"><said direct=True>“You couldn'</said><said direct=False>t offer me a greater novelty.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020671"><said direct=False>She slipped her hand into my arm, and laid her cheek against my coat sleeve.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020672"><said direct=True>“You know you thought it was so mad of me wanting to come to the Red House, but I saw these bars that very first day, and I thought how nice it would be for them to have a beautiful place to remember when they grow up. Not to remember the people next door, and organ-grinders, and gritty dust, and pavements, but quietness and big green trees and lawns, and this grave old house. Don'</said><said direct=False>t you think it would be nice for them?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020673"><said direct=True>“For them?”</said><said direct=False> I said, not because I did not understand.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020674"><said direct=False>“For—if ever we had any children, Len.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020675"><said direct=False>Some day, if we live, we shall be old and gray, feeble, and look back with dim eyes along a lane of years; and even then that good moment will stand out golden and perfect—the moment when, strong in youth and love and hope, we stood together, looking out together through the nursery bars and the green creeper towards the years to come. The summer day when, if our eyes were dim, it was with the dew of morning, when, if our hands trembled, it was because they held such full measure of life's good things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020676"><said direct=False>Chloe raised her head suddenly. “I told you I was silly,” she said, “but since I am silly I'll say one silly thing more. I don't think any one in this world was ever so happy as I am. And when I get worried and cross, you know—Oh, why am I saying all the things that you know perfectly, and that one doesn't say? You must get back to your work, and I'll try to do that drawing of the duke. And to-night we'll have a consultation about Mary. Yolande shall advise us.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020677"><said direct=False>That evening when Yolande and my wife were deep in a discussion on the way in which a really right-minded dressmaker should cut a skirt, I strolled into the new room, and there on the table was Chloe's drawing of the duke and the humble companion. The duke's arm was wrong, so were his Grace's legs. Pencil and India-rubber lay near. I fingered an H.B. absently for a moment, and presently found myself seated at the table, elbows squared, head bent, working up the duke to the semblance of something human. I always took the drawing prize in my youth—nothing to boast of, since, proverbially, it falls to “the greatest muff in the school”—and at Oxford I had taken a keen pleasure in caricaturing those who sit in the seats of the mighty, and in idealizing those who stand behind the counters of the pastry-cook. Also, in the days when I dreamed legal dreams in the Temple, and spent my idle days in the law courts, I had made constant use of the excellent quills and stationery provided by the state, to draw portraits of the leading legal lights. And I could see the shapes of things. I knew how the arm should go. I knew also how a man's clothes hang when he is in them, which Chloe never could grasp. So I rubbed out most of her duke, and put in a duke of my own—quite a flesh-and-blood creature, and a great deal too good for Chloe's presentment of the humble companion, with whose carefully arranged draperies I did not venture to meddle. I touched up the background a little, correcting the wild perspective of a console-table—an article of furniture which had apparently struck Chloe as ducal—slipped the drawing under its sheet of tissue-paper, and went off to confess to my wife what I had done.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020678"><said direct=False>But I found her up to her ears in sleeves and yokes, and it seemed simpler to make Yolande play the piano in the great drawing-room, and sit beside Chloe in the twilight, and think of many things, only now and then wondering vaguely how she would meet the discovery of my presumptuous iniquity.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020679"><said direct=False>We had agreed that we would allow Miss Richborough an evening's repose—a night's rest—before laying upon her the burden of our cares—our drunken tenant and our angel servant, so soon to be translated to a sphere far from our deep need of her. And the evening passed pleasantly enough. Yolande had brought half a dozen sketch-books with her, filled with little notes of her Italian tour. She really draws rather well; and even when her drawings are incorrect, they are amusing. Chloe and I laughed and criticised, but no one said anything worth recording. The really noteworthy remark was made next morning by Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020680"><said direct=True>“Oh, Len,”</said><said direct=False> she said, coming to me, with the duke and the humble companion in her hands, “look what she—I mean, look what the ghost has done! Oh, what a clever ghost to be able to draw and write better—I mean as well as we can!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Oh, Len,” she said, coming to me, with the duke and the humble companion in her hands, “look what she</said><said direct=True>—I mean, look what the ghost has done! Oh, what a clever ghost to be able to draw and write better—</said><said direct=False>I mean as well as we can!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020681"><said direct=False>I would not have believed that she could be so deceived. Yolande's drawing is absolutely different from mine; she has a sense of humor, but she is wholly lacking in any real feeling for line. Yet Chloe could believe that my duke was Yolande's work! I told myself that I felt humbled, but really I felt a proud, if chastened, indignation.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020682"><said direct=True>“It is indeed a ghost in a thousand!”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Shall you send the drawing in?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020683"><said direct=True>“Of course!”</said><said direct=False> she said, opening wide eyes at me. “And I only wish the ghost would illustrate trate that hateful fairy tale for the Children's Globe.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020684"><said direct=False>I determined that the ghost should do this, too, or I would know the reason why.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020685"><said direct=True>“And now,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, “we must hold a council of war.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020686"><said direct=False>We took Yolande and showed her our own new room—our loafery—and then we asked her whether she would prefer to hold the council there, or in the white parlor where her settle and bureau were, or under the cedars where the hammock hung, and where the grass would be dry in spite of yesterday's rain. We waited breathlessly for her answer. She stood at the door of our new room, and looked round it, an appreciation in her eyes before which our own dropped. Then she said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020687"><said direct=True>“Not here, anyway; this is your very own room. I should feel as uncomfortable in it as I should in your boots, Len, or in Chloe'</said><said direct=False>s gold-rimmed eye-glasses. I vote for the cedars.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020688"><said direct=False>We each said, “Nonsense!” but we went down the stairs, each holding one of her kind hands. No one but Yolande would have understood. I wondered whether she had noticed the window-bars.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020689"><said direct=False>So it was under the cedars that we pointed out to Yolande the overflowing measure of our personal sonal embarrassments. The migration of Mary, the weed-choked garden, the impossible tenants, the empty cottages which our one experience made us fear any thought of letting. And Yolande listened with the deepest sympathy, and the shadows of the cedar dappled her green gown and stole the light from her red-gold hair.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020690"><said direct=True>“Can you do anything?”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe at last, desperately breaking through Miss Richborough's guard of noncommittal condolence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020691"><said direct=True>“I suppose I could offer to stay and help you to wash and spin, and bake and brew,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “but I'm not effectual. And, besides, it would be like cutting firewood with a razor.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020692"><said direct=True>“Your modesty was always your strong point, my dear Razor,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020693"><said direct=True>“A razor is not fitted for chopping firewood,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, demurely, “and it is fitted for other things. If you cut firewood with it it can't do its own proper work that it was made for. And if I may just hit out once brutally and straight from the shoulder, I will relieve my mind and not hurt you very much.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020694"><said direct=True>“Strike here,”</said><said direct=False> said my wife, with her hands to her heart.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020695"><said direct=True>“May I? Thanks, awfully. Well, then, you all-round people, who can turn your hand to anything, you'</said><said direct=False>re always chopping firewood with razors zors; you're always diverting your energies from their proper channel, and doing a dozen people's work indifferent well, because you haven't time to do it properly. Len cleans boots and door-steps and candlesticks, and comes to his real work with only half a heart; Chloe can't do her drawing comfortably, because she has sweeping and dusting and cooking to see to. A really reasonable Len, a truly conscientious Chloe, would work at its own trade, and hire other people to work at theirs. I have spoken.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020696"><said direct=True>“Poor fox!”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, softly; “were the nasty grapes sour, then?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020697"><said direct=True>“I will not pretend,”</said><said direct=False> Miss Richborough said, severely, “to misunderstand your allusion. I am not an accomplished sweeper. I dust ill and rarely. When I wash up I always break a cup or a plate. I dare say I should clean a boot with whitening, or a front door-step with Globe polish.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020698"><said direct=True>“And yet, by your own confession, you love to have your finger in your neighbor'</said><said direct=False>s pies.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020699"><said direct=True>“Exactly; I like to do what I am fitted for. I can adjust my neighbor'</said><said direct=False>s pies better than any professional pastry-cook. And adjusting pies doesn't interfere with my regular work—that's the point.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020700"><said direct=True>“But we like doing things in the house,”</said><said direct=False> Chloe ventured.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020701"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t I know it? Oh, you needn't trouble to convince me of your depravity. I stick to what I said. All these irons in the fire—yes, even that contemptible little bit of garden that you've weeded—all take off from the energy you ought to spend on your writing and drawing. You are both exceedingly naughty children!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Don't I know it? Oh, you needn't trouble to convince me of your depravity. I stick to what I said. All these irons in the fire</said><said direct=True>—yes, even that contemptible little bit of garden that you've weeded—</said><said direct=False>all take off from the energy you ought to spend on your writing and drawing. You are both exceedingly naughty children!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020702"><said direct=True>“How,”</said><said direct=False> I ventured, “in these circumstances would a really good child behave?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020703"><said direct=True>“It would not bite blades of grass, to begin with,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “when it was being lectured for its own good. And then look at your ruffianly tenant. When one lets houses one employs an agent, and he insists on references. He knows his business.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020704"><said direct=False>Chloe looked appealingly at me, and I threw a daisy at her, and said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020705"><said direct=True>“We were certainly wrong there.”</said><said direct=False> Her eyes thanked me for the “we,” and Yolande went on:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020706"><said direct=True>“Then as to servants, it would pay you to have a really good one, if you had to pay her thirty or forty pounds a year. Don'</said><said direct=False>t open your pretty eyes at me, Chloe—I mean it. You've always got far more work than you can do, as things are now. If you really stick to your work you could well afford the wages of a paragon.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020707"><said direct=True>“Puzzle: to find the paragon,”</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020708"><said direct=True>“Ah! that'</said><said direct=False>s where I come in. I can't wash dishes—anyway, I won't. But if you'll give me a free hand I'll find you a servant as good as this Mary of yours. I'll bet my Omar Khayyam, and it's a first edition, you know, against your Shropshire Lad!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020709"><said direct=True>“Done!”</said><said direct=False> I said, instantly. “And what about the degraded Prosser?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020710"><said direct=True>“One thing at a time,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande. “The question of the tenantry must stand over till we've settled the problem of domestic service. Ah, don't talk to me any more! My brain is teeming with the most fascinating ideas, as brilliant as practicable. Let me alone while my schemes develop.” She leaned back in the hammock among the yellow cushions, and in three minutes she was fast asleep. Chloe and I stole away, through the garden to the seat under the quince-tree.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020711"><said direct=True>“We are like babes in the wood,”</said><said direct=False> she said. “I wonder whether she'll succeed.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020712"><said direct=True>“She always succeeds,”</said><said direct=False> I said, shortly; “it's her métier. Ours, I suppose, is that of these same babes—helplessness, appealing to the pity of all kindly passers-by—and I own that it's not a métier I'm particularly proud of.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“She always succeeds,” I said, shortly; “it's her métier. Ours, I suppose, is that of these same babes</said><said direct=True>—helplessness, appealing to the pity of all kindly passers-by—</said><said direct=False>and I own that it's not a métier I'm particularly proud of.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020713"><said direct=True>“Yolande isn'</said><said direct=False>t every passer-by.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020714"><said direct=True>“Yes, she is,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “every single one.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020715"><said direct=True>“Dear,”</said><said direct=False> said my wife, calmly, “you are very cross, and presently you will be sorry.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020716"><said direct=False>I had not been cross before—at least, I think not; but now, perhaps— I picked an unripe quince and threw it at a blackbird on the ivy. I did not hit the blackbird.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020717"><said direct=True>“Seriously,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, catching at my hand as it sought another quince, “I think Yolande's right. It's our métier to write and draw, and earn our livings. We can't be clever enough to do everything. Why should we be too proud to let her try to do what we haven't been able to do—get a servant who will stay? You're not really vexed because Yolande said what she did? You know how fond she is of us.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020718"><said direct=True>“I only know I feel contemptible,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “I ought to be able to manage these things for myself.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020719"><said direct=False>“Then shall I tell Yolande not to trouble? Len, how silly you are! What is it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020720"><said direct=True>“I should have thought it would be more pleasant to you to think you'</said><said direct=False>d married a man, and not a babe in the wood.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020721"><said direct=True>“You were manly enough in the Bandbox, but I didn'</said><said direct=False>t know then half how dear you were. Oh, Len! don't you think it's nice to find out all sorts of things together, even—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020722"><said direct=False>“Even our babe-in-the-woodness?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020723"><said direct=True>“Yes, even our limitations. Why should we want to pretend we can do everything? We can do a great many things that Yolande can'</said><said direct=False>t do.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020724"><said direct=False>“Yes—wash up, and sweep, and dust.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020725"><said direct=False>“But you like doing them. And we can write and draw.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020726"><said direct=True>“So can—so can the ghost. Dear, the black dog is on my back. You'</said><said direct=False>d better go away and leave me for a bit.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020727"><said direct=False>Now Heaven be blessed for a wife who did not answer that appeal with an, “Oh, darling, surely you don't want to be away from me?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020728"><said direct=False>For one shameful instant I feared it. One does not learn everything about one's wife even in ten married months.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020729"><said direct=False>As for Chloe, she kissed my forehead lightly, and without a word walked away down the avenue of nut-trees. I watched her white skirt till the last sway of it against the hollyhocks, and the moment she was out of sight I sprang to my feet and ran after her. I came up with her by the bench of rotting hives where once the bees followed their sweet industry. I caught her arm, and she turned to me with a smile.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020730"><said direct=True>“Chloe, Chloe, I'</said><said direct=False>ve put the nasty black dog up the chimney. I'm the happiest man alive! I'm King of the Universe, and you're Queen! Yolande doesn't belong to the reigning house. Poor Yolande! we can't do less than let her be our vizier.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020731"><said direct=False>I was holding her hands now, and we were looking at each other with that unquenchable amazement which still comes to us at odd moments in life's winding way—amazement that there should be in this world two people so suited to each other as we; and the further wonder at the clemency of a fate which has allowed us to find each other. This, I suppose, is a lover's commonplace. It was our abiding marvel.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020732"><said direct=False>During the next week Yolande worked a good deal in her room, bicycled a little with me, went to town once or twice with Chloe, and entirely won the heart of Mary, who stated publicly that she would lie down for Miss Yo to walk on if it would please her. Twice in that week the ghost walked. It finished a story for me, and I wished it would mind its own business. But I had been positively shocked to find myself capable of a feeling towards Yolande that was very like jealousy, and just because I knew deep in my heart that the ghost's work was better than my own, I felt that it was equally impossible for me to insist on an explanation, or to refuse to send in the ghost's work as mine. I had given away my ignoble secret to Chloe now, and I could not dare to sink further in her eyes. So I sent in the ghost's work, and the editor was delighted. The pricking of that same jealousy stung me to correct two of Chloe's drawings and to originate a third. It was balm to me to hear Chloe's raptures over the drawings, and to know that she believed them to be the work of Yolande—Yolande, who could not have done anything half so good to save her life.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020733"><said direct=False>It was on the evening before Mary's wedding. I had presented to her a neat service of teacups and saucers, and Chloe had embroidered for her a tea-cloth and a collar. I almost think she had sewn tears into the pretty pattern. Mary had thanked me for my gifts and for my heartfelt expressions of grief at parting from her, but it was not till Chloe presented her gifts worked by her own hands that Mary broke down.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020734"><said direct=True>“I ain'</said><said direct=False>t a-going to leave you, mum,” she sobbed. “Miss Yo she told me not to say nothing, so as to make it a regular surprise for you when I come back. I'm only going for a week along of my Jim to see his father and mother down Marden way, and then I'm coming back. Miss Yo told me you'd told her to arrange what she liked.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020735"><said direct=True>“But your Jim,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, aghast, “what will he say?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020736"><said direct=True>“He'</said><said direct=False>s only too pleased, mum.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020737"><said direct=False>“Only too pleased? Not to live with his wife?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020738"><said direct=True>“Oh, mum,”</said><said direct=False> said Mary, giggling through her tears, “Miss Yo arranged it all. Him and me is to have all the rooms beyond the kitchen. He's got a beautiful lot of furniture as come to him from his aunt at Canterbury. He won't be in no one's way, mum, being out so much, and I'm to do for you just the same as ever; and I am so glad as never was, for I couldn't abide the notion of leaving you, mum, and you putting roses in my bedroom and all, as if I was the Queen, and now working those things for me with your own pretty hands!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020739"><said direct=False>When I came in a moment later I found Mary and Chloe in each other's arms, and I am not sure but that they were both crying a little.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020740"><said direct=False>It was a simple solution, wasn't it? Yet Chloe and I had never thought of it. And I had lost my Shropshire Lad.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020742"><said direct=False>MARY'S wedding was to be a quiet one. Her Jim brought a dejected young carpenter with him, to be his “backer,” as he explained, and we all walked up to the church in the village, where I was to give away the bride, while Yolande officiated as bridesmaid. Chloe merely attended, as she explained, to see fair play. The ceremony was fixed for Sunday afternoon, and when we arrived at the church we were somewhat disconcerted to find a large congregation. Mary and Jim had not any desire to hide the light of their love-match under a bushel. “We ain't ashamed of it, mum,” she said, in a hollow whisper, answering Chloe's agonized glance in the church porch. “I've been reading about it in the prayer-book, and it says, ‘In the face of this congregation,’ and that means afore a churchful. We 'ain't got no friends here to ask, so we thought we'd have it done after service, so as to be sure of the congregation anyway.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020743"><said direct=False>The congregation looked at us with interest. There was no mistaking Mary's gray cashmere dress—a wedding-garment, if ever there was one—trimmed with lavish indiscrimination and white cotton lace. And even if the gown had left any room for doubt the orange flowers in her brown hat and in the blue bow at her neck must have enlightened the least observant. Chloe and Yolande, in pale muslins, looked quite as bridal as the bride, and Jim and his “backer” and I each looked uncomfortable enough to have been the bridegroom. The verger recognized us unerringly as the wedding-party, and showed us to a pew near the chancel, where we remained till the service was over. I had faintly hoped that the congregation would be glad to get out—the thermometer must have been about a hundred in the shade—but Mary had judged better than I; not a soul moved, and she was married “in the face of this congregation,” as she had wished and intended.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020744"><said direct=False>The clergyman was old and short-sighted—he could not see the orange blossoms, I suppose. At any rate, I found it quite difficult to prevent him from marrying Yolande, in her muslin and Valenciennes and her big white hat with the ostrich feathers, to the backer, whose white buttonhole was, I admit, twice as big and twice as bridal as Jim's.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020745"><said direct=False>However, the verger backed me up, and the right couple were married, at last. We all went back to the Red House and drank the health of the happy pair—in Asti, though, not in champagne—because Asti is twice as cheap and twice as nice. At least, Chloe says so.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020746"><said direct=False>Then we saw them off at the station. Then we came home and tore off our smart, hot clothes, and got into flannels or muslin wrappers, and got our own tea—at least, Chloe and I did—and drank it under the cedars.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020747"><said direct=False>When tea was over, Chloe said, maliciously, “Wouldn't you like to wash up the cups, Yolande?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020748"><said direct=True>“Your cups are, I believe, Spode—or is it only Spode and Copeland? Shall I wash up? I warn you that I cannot answer for my fingers. They lose their grasp if I become interested in my own reflections—or, yes—or in the conversation of others, so it'</said><said direct=False>s no use offering to talk to me while I do it. I know my limitations, and I abide by them.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020749"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m not proud of my limitations,” said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020750"><said direct=True>“No, dear,”</said><said direct=False> Yolande answered, sweetly; “that's because you haven't any. Why don't you get some? They are a great convenience.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020751"><said direct=True>“You speak as though one could decide one'</said><said direct=False>s limitations for one's self.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020752"><said direct=True>“And can'</said><said direct=False>t one? A clever woman like you—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020753"><said direct=True>“No butter, thanks,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020754"><said direct=True>“—Like you could do anything that silly women can do, and could do any one thing she gave her whole mind to, better than these silly women. But no one can do everything. When you'</said><said direct=False>ve found that out, and decided what you want to do, you've learned your limitations.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020755"><said direct=True>“You mean,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “that you could wash dishes with the best, and sweep and dust und so weiter, if you only cared to?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020756"><said direct=True>“Of course I could”</said><said direct=False>—Yolande opened her lovely eyes—“I could do anything I gave my mind to. But I haven't a hundred minds to give to a hundred industries. When I was quite a child I declined to be taught to sew. I saw, even then, that one's knowledge of feminine crafts is just a weapon in the hands of the evil one, who lies in wait at every corner to keep one off one's real work. I meant to go to Girton: so when they made me wash up the tea-things, I always dropped something. They soon left off asking me to wash up.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Of course I could”</said><said direct=True>—Yolande opened her lovely eyes—</said><said direct=False>“I could do anything I gave my mind to. But I haven't a hundred minds to give to a hundred industries. When I was quite a child I declined to be taught to sew. I saw, even then, that one's knowledge of feminine crafts is just a weapon in the hands of the evil one, who lies in wait at every corner to keep one off one's real work. I meant to go to Girton: so when they made me wash up the tea-things, I always dropped something. They soon left off asking me to wash up.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020757"><said direct=False>“How horribly immoral!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020758"><said direct=True>“Not at all. I only enforced my decision by concrete arguments—the only ones my aunt could understand. The secret of success is to know what you want and what you don'</said><said direct=False>t want.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020759"><said direct=False>I looked at Chloe—we had said the same thing in almost the same words but the other day.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020760"><said direct=True>“Do you suppose,”</said><said direct=False> Yolande went on, “that I should have taken every prize in each form all the way up the school, and then got a scholarship at Girton, if I had allowed myself to be taught to dust the drawing-room and to make my own dresses, and sew on buttons and darn stockings for the boys?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020761"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know,” said Chloe; “perhaps mathematics take more time than drawing. Anyway, I liked learning the things you despise, and I liked doing them. I liked helping mother. I like playing with my own house.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020762"><said direct=True>“Helping Len—yes—perhaps it would be different. You see, I never had a mother. If I had had, I dare say I should have learned all these arts, just so as to be able to do something for her when she wanted it. But, as it was, I set myself to do a man'</said><said direct=False>s work, and I tried to live a man's life—apart from these little worries. And what's more, I succeeded. There's not a feminine trait about me, thank Heaven.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020763"><said direct=False>We all three laughed. Chloe said:</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020764"><said direct=False>“Take down your pretty hair, Yolande. I want to look at it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020765"><said direct=False>The wide, lace-ruffled sleeves fell back from her creamy, rounded arms where the gold bangles shone. I could see the diamonds and sapphires and opals of her rings gleaming among the copper-gold of her hair as she drew out the silver filigree-topped hair-pins. Then the coils of bright hair began to fall over the delicate silk muslin of her gown till she stood before us clothed in a glowing mantle that fell below her knees. She threw her long hair back, with a quintessentially feminine gesture, and came and sat beside Chloe on the grass, where her hair curled and coiled on the ground, like swirls of surf on the edge of a sea lit by sunset. We looked at her—bright hair, bright bangles, bright rings, bright eyes—and we said together,</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020766"><said direct=False>“No feminine traits!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020767"><said direct=True>“That'</said><said direct=False>s not a feminine trait,” she answered, elliptically. “Even a man tries to look as nice as he can. It's not much he can do—but he does it. Look at men's ties. They use thousands of them, and nobody ever notices what they wear, any more than any one ever notices whether women wear threes or fours in shoes. Yet most women pinch their feet and their waists.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020768"><said direct=True>“Men notice waists, anyhow,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “If Len sees a girl pinched in so that you wonder she doesn't snap off short, he says, ‘There's a smart girl.’”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020769"><said direct=True>“We are wandering from the point,”</said><said direct=False> I said, hastily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020770"><said direct=True>“Which, by-the-way, is that this very evening as ever is I'</said><said direct=False>m off to my club,” said Yolande, briskly. “I will not be taught to do house-work, and I love you both far too much not to fall an easy victim to your arts if I were to see you really in need of help. I can't abjure the creed of a lifetime. My only safety is in flight. When Mary comes back I'll come back, too, if you'll have me. I can't stay here and see the dark side of Mary's honey-moon. And meantime you'll give me leave to let my master-mind play round the question of your horrible tenant. Did you notice his front garden as we came back from church? By-the-way, why did you never tell me your church has a Norman chancel?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020771"><said direct=True>“We didn'</said><said direct=False>t know it ourselves,” said Chloe. “You see, we've always been to Westenden church. It's a lovely walk through the woods in the evening. Perhaps among the other things you declined to learn you escaped the knowledge that after you've moved into a new house your first appearance in your parish church is a signal that you are ready for your neighbors to call on you? Well, we didn't want them to call on us.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020772"><said direct=False>“Perhaps they will now, mum, thanking you for your slap about my ignorance of pretty manners.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020773"><said direct=True>“Oh no,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, “our appearance there was unofficial. Any one could see that.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020774"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m not sure—but I wish you luck,” said Yolande. “And now I must tear myself away.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020775"><said direct=True>“Selfish thing,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020776"><said direct=False>“Not selfish, sweetheart! Only faithful, in the face of tremendous temptation, to the ideals of a lifetime.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020777"><said direct=True>“When you marry,”</said><said direct=False> said my wife, impressively, “your husband will be a poor little hen-pecked thing.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020778"><said direct=True>“I shall never marry. I never met but one man who was nice enough for a husband, and he was only nice enough for you—not nearly nice enough for me. Now I'</said><said direct=False>ve involved you both in the ruins of a compliment, and I'll go.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020779"><said direct=False>She went.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020780"><said direct=False>I own that it was with an invigorating sense of something pleasant promised that I awoke next morning. The feeling deepened as I stole down-stairs and lighted the kitchen fire. Mary—may her honey-moon last her life long!—had dried a little stack of wood and piled it in the wash-house ready for us. I filled the kettle, swept up the hearth, and had finished laying the cloth for breakfast when Chloe appeared.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020781"><said direct=False>I do not know which of us most enjoyed the house-work that followed. Chloe loves house-work for its own sake. As she says, it is play, because it is not what one ought to be doing. For myself, I admit that when I see my wife working about the house I experience a more intimate sense of possession even than when I walk with her in the garden, hand in hand, and certainly far deeper than I can ever feel when she is drawing away for dear life to add her share to our income. Theoretically I know how right and proper it is that she should earn money as well as I. Practically I want to earn all the money, and to let her spend it. This is the relic of a barbarous age, and so is the delightful thrill of domestic pleasure with which I see my wife busy about our house. At the same time I like to prove to her that I can sweep and dust and wash up as well as she can, if not better. The only drawback to our happiness that morning was Mary's neatness and cleanness, which left us little or nothing to do. When all her necessary work was done, I noted still a hungry look in Chloe's eye.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020782"><said direct=False>“What, Oliver! Asking for more?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020783"><said direct=True>“Yes, Mr. Bumble. I'</said><said direct=False>ll get lunch now—and then you must go and write, and I'll put on my very oldest rags and clean out the china-cupboard.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020784"><said direct=False>Her oldest rags were the red-and-white Trouville petticoat and a blue, long-sleeved painting pinafore. I left her with bare feet, and sleeves rolled up to the shoulder, carrying the piles of china into the hall.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020785"><said direct=True>“I shall scrub the shelves first,”</said><said direct=False> she said; “you know I've never let Mary touch it—she's never even seen it unlocked—so it's all as black as ink. And then I'll wash the floor, and then I'll wash the china and put it all back after I've cleaned the window.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I shall scrub the shelves first,” she said; “you know I've never let Mary touch it</said><said direct=True>—she's never even seen it unlocked—</said><said direct=False>so it's all as black as ink. And then I'll wash the floor, and then I'll wash the china and put it all back after I've cleaned the window.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020786"><said direct=True>“Let me clean the window,”</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020787"><said direct=True>“No, not for the world. I'</said><said direct=False>m going to enjoy myself. I'm going to play, I am—I'm going to fritter away my intellect, as Yolande says. And you're going to enjoy the dignity of labor, and do what you are really fitted for. Lucky boy!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020788"><said direct=True>“If you taunt me with my chains I won'</said><said direct=False>t pull an oar at all in this galley.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020789"><said direct=False>“Where are you going to work?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020790"><said direct=True>“In the loafery. It'</said><said direct=False>s the only place where I can even begin to be moderately contented away from you.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG19020791"><said direct=False>“What a pretty speech! You shall bring me two pails of water for a reward. One hot and one cold. Len, why do you like the loafery so much?”</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG190201222"><said direct=False>She liked it all, even the nonsense of the last five stanzas, and she said that she liked it none the less because it happened to be written on the backs of a green-grocer's bill, the voting-card of a candidate for the school board, and two odd envelopes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201223"><said direct=False>She said: “It is very pretty, Len. I didn't know you ever noticed whether I was sewing or not.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201224"><said direct=True>“You don'</said><said direct=False>t know my observant nature,” I said, “and after all these years of married life, too.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201225"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s more than one year, anyway,” she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201226"><said direct=False>“Do you remember the day when you made me decide to leave the dear Bandbox?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201227"><said direct=False>“Shall I ever forget it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201228"><said direct=False>“And that other dear day when you invented the loafery and we looked at the bars?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201229"><said direct=True>“Let'</said><said direct=False>s look at them now,” she cried, jumping up and dropping scissors, thimble, tapemeasure, and a mass of lace and muslin. When I had picked everything up we went to the window. The creeper's leaves were gone now, and we stood between dull red curtains and looked out on the misty garden, where the dead leaves lay, patches of wet gold and brown in the faint sunlight, and where a robin on a leafless apple-tree was singing his very best, and pretending to the rooks in the elms that he was a thrush disguised in a scarlet waistcoat.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201230"><said direct=True>“Those Antiquarian brutes,”</said><said direct=False> I said, presently, “they'll be here directly. By Jove! they are here. They look horribly small. Can it be that the Junior Blackheath only admits dwarfs?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201231"><said direct=True>“Those can'</said><said direct=False>t be the Antiquaries,” Chloe cried. “Why, Len, they look like children! Lots and lots of them. What can they want? They look like a slice of a strayed, frayed school treat. And they've all got books, and they don't seem to have got any grown-up people with them. Oh, do go and turn them out!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201232"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>ll go and find out what they want—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201233"><said direct=True>“Oh yes, and they'</said><said direct=False>ll say they're botanizing, or geologizing, or something, and you'll let them stay, like you did the boys that wanted conquerors off the chestnut-trees, and overran everything. I've not forgotten it; I'll go myself.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201234"><said direct=False>She ran down the stairs, slipped her feet into the wooden sabots that she keeps for sudden winter garden excursions, and stumped off angrily down the path under the cedars. I took a short-cut between Jim's celery-trenches. Chloe is terrible in her wrath, but if it grows too hot it boils over in tears of rage; and I did not wish Chloe to cry, and I not there.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201235"><said direct=False>The invaders were grouped round the sundial. All had their backs to us, and one of them was reading aloud. I caught a few words:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201236"><said direct=False>“....told the time when Charles the First was beheaded, and recorded the death-devouring progress of the Great Plague and the Fire of London. There is no doubt the sun often shone even in those devastating occasions, so we may picture—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201237"><said direct=False>Then the reader heard the unmistakable threat in the emphatic stump, stump of Chloe's wooden shoes, and stopped short. Her eyes were angry, her mouth expressed inhospitable intentions. I thought I heard a murmur of, “Oh, Crikey!” from the reader, but the next moment he had stepped towards my wife and taken off his cap with an oddly graceful flourish. He was a boy; there were other boys, who followed his lead in cap-doffing. There were girls, too, rosy-faced little girls in highwayman coats and scarlet Tam-o'-Shanters. The whole invading company were, as Chloe had said, “children.” And all wore spectacles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201238"><said direct=True>“Do you know that this is a private garden?”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, severely. “You are trespassing, you know.” Her voice is very pretty, even when she is angry, and she was not nearly so angry as she had been before the boys took their caps off.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201239"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s not your garden, is it?” asked the smallest boy of all, goggling at her through his spectacles, and speaking in an off-hand but perfectly agreeable manner. One of the girls shook him gently, and bade him shut up.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201240"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>re most awfully sorry,” said the boy who had been reading. “We wouldn't have come if we'd thought you'd mind, but we've got a pass, so I thought it was all right. Here, hold my spectacles half a sec., Alice, and I'll find it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201241"><said direct=False>The prettiest of the red-capped girls took the spectacles, and the boy felt in several pockets, while I drew near to offer Chloe my moral support.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201242"><said direct=True>“Here it is!”</said><said direct=False> he said, at last, disentangling a dingy paper from a mass of string, matches, envelopes, putty, and cobbler's wax, and, with really a rather nice bow, he handed to Chloe—my letter to the Antiquarian Society!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201243"><said direct=True>“But this was not meant for you,”</said><said direct=False> she said. “This is to Mr. Turnbull—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201244"><said direct=True>“That was my fault,”</said><said direct=False> said a younger boy—a thin, pale, anxious-looking child. “We tossed up who should copy out the letter on Albert's uncle's type-writer, and I was thinking about something else, so I copied it, name and all.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201245"><said direct=False>Chloe put her hands to her head with a gesture of despair. I said: “Just think a minute. Remember, we've no idea what all this is about. Just tell us, right away from the beginning, how you came to be here, and what you want.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201246"><said direct=False>There was a silence. Then the eldest girl said, “Oswald, you tell.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201247"><said direct=False>The boy who had been reading twisted his cap, and stood uneasily on one foot. But almost at once he planted his feet firmly on the ground and began, looking Chloe straight in the eyes with a most disarming frankness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201248"><said direct=False>“First of all, we are very sorry the lady is vexed, and we beg her pardon.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201249"><said direct=True>“That'</said><said direct=False>s all right,” said Chloe, unexpectedly. “Go on.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201250"><said direct=True>“Well—when we were staying in the country some Antiquaries wrote to Albert'</said><said direct=False>s uncle—this is Albert”—he pushed forward a shy boy in velvet knickerbockers—“and asked him to let them come and see his house. And we thought we should be feeling a bit slack in the holidays, so we thought we'd play at being antiquaries. And Albert's uncle showed us this place once from the train when we were going to Bexley Heath, and he said some great person lived here once, and it was a historic place, and we can't remember who it was. And he said a clever writer lived here now, and he told us the name. So we wrote to ask leave to come, and you gave it right enough.”</said></p>

<p n="ENG190201251"><said direct=False>The voice was reproachful.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201252"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> I said, completely melted by this unexpected recognition of my—or the ghost's—talent as a writer. “Are you Mr. Edward Turnbull?”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Yes,” I said, completely melted by this unexpected recognition of my</said><said direct=True>—or the ghost's—</said><said direct=False>talent as a writer. “Are you Mr. Edward Turnbull?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201253"><said direct=True>“Rather not”</said><said direct=False>—his tone was somewhat injured. “I was coming to that. We decided to copy out the letter that the real Antiquity secretary sent to Albert's uncle, and Noël had to do it, because we tossed up about it, and he lost. And he got thinking of a poem he's writing, and copied it, name and all—and only remembered it after we'd licked the stamp for the letter. So we thought it didn't matter. And if you'd rather we'd been Mr. Turnbull, you wouldn't have if you'd seen how thin his legs are, and how he couldn't laugh because his mouth was so tight.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Rather not”</said><said direct=True>—his tone was somewhat injured. “I was coming to that.

<p n="ENG190201254"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>d much rather have you,” said Chloe, smiling ing; and as she smiled I could see how deeply all present fell in love with her on the instant. “I'm sorry I didn't understand. We won't interfere any more. You'd like to go on reading your papers. Who wrote them?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201255"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>ve each done one,” said the eldest girl—she was a little prim, and not so pretty as the others—”only mine is all out of a book, because it is so difficult to think of things.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“We've each done one,” said the eldest girl</said><said direct=True>—she was a little prim, and not so pretty as the others—</said><said direct=False>”only mine is all out of a book, because it is so difficult to think of things.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201256"><said direct=True>“Do you always wear spectacles?”</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201257"><said direct=False>They all laughed. It was a very pleasant sound, this peal of young laughter in our old garden.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201258"><said direct=True>“Oh no!”</said><said direct=False> said the prettiest girl, “only to make us look like learned antiquities—antiquaries, I mean. It was an awful bother collecting them all; some of them have no glass in.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201259"><said direct=True>“One more question,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “If you're not Edward Turnbull, who are you?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201260"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>re the Bastables,” the biggest boy said, with a sort of shy pride, as if he were confessing, in his modesty's despite, to royal lineage. “I'm Oswald, and these are Alice and Dora; Noël's the one who typed the letter; and this shaver is H.O.; and these are Daisy and Denny Foulkes; and Albert Morrison I told you about before.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201261"><said direct=True>“You'</said><said direct=False>ll have lunch with us, won't you?” asked Chloe, abruptly, picking up her blue train and fixing her feet in her wooden shoes. “I don't think there'll be much, but we can make out with bread and jam—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201262"><said direct=True>“I like you,”</said><said direct=False> said the smallest boy, before the others could answer. “I like you very much, indeed, and I'll have lunch with you, whatever it is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201263"><said direct=False>The others murmured thanks, and we left them to their play.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201264"><said direct=True>“Aren'</said><said direct=False>t they perfect dears?” said Chloe, when we were out of earshot. “I don't like the Morrison boy, but the others are lovely. Why aren't all children nice?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201265"><said direct=True>“They all are—if they have nice grown-ups belonging to them,”</said><said direct=False> I said, enunciating lightly a tremendous dogma. “But, darling and reckless one, do you know that there's nothing in the house but cold neck of mutton, and even that, if I remember right, is invidiously distinguished as being not the best end?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201266"><said direct=True>“I know,”</said><said direct=False> she said; “but you must go up to Elmhurst and get things: tinned tongue—children always adore tongue—and candied pineapple and tangerine oranges in silver paper, and nuts, and bananas. Oh, I do think children are so nice! I wish these weren't so big. The smallest boy, the one they call H.O., he's simply a duck.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I know,” she said; “but you must go up to Elmhurst and get things: tinned tongue</said><said direct=True>—children always adore tongue—</said><said direct=False>and candied pineapple and tangerine oranges in silver paper, and nuts, and bananas. Oh, I do think children are so nice! I wish these weren't so big. The smallest boy, the one they call H.O., he's simply a duck.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201267"><said direct=True>“Oswald for my money,”</said><said direct=False> said I, “and Alice! Make a list of what I'm to get, and I'll be off. It's half-past twelve now.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201268"><said direct=False>I left Chloe laying the table for eleven in the white parlor. When I came back the cloth was spread, but Chloe had vanished. I found her in the garden submerged to the shoulders in a wave of children, and she carried nine pairs of spectacles in her hand. We all went in to lunch. I was now a mere outsider. Chloe, by some art unknown to me, had become one of the children, and was the most childlike child of all. The others really were not bad children. I don't think I ever met any so full of enthusiastic energy. As a permanency, they might have been a little wearing, for, strong in Chloe's extraordinary assumption of esprit de corps, they now threw away all shyness, and talked to us with simple directness of adventures, of contemporary literature, of the ways of Providence, and their own vital ambitions. They had a very full flow of conversation, and a much larger vocabulary than I remember having at their age. What struck me most was their confident assumption that, now we knew them, we could not help liking them; and the assumption was, I own, justified. This assumption was particularly marked in Oswald. He evidently thought a good deal of himself, but, as I could not but reluctantly acknowledge, with some justice! They were extremely “free in their talk,” as Mary said afterwards, but never vulgar. And they were very much funnier than they meant to be. The lunch, for which Chloe had madly brought out the best green-and-gold table-centre, charmed them. I had not thought that Chloe could be so thoroughly inspired with any menu. When no one could eat any more, the children looked at each other, and Dora, the prim one, said, quite unconscious of the evidence of rehearsal with which her speech bristled,</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201269"><said direct=False>“Thank you very much for letting us come, and for having us to lunch.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201270"><said direct=True>“And for getting such a jolly lunch,”</said><said direct=False> said the pale boy. “I think it is splendid. If you will give me a piece of paper and a pencil I will write you a piece of poetry about it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201271"><said direct=False>While I was getting these I heard the prim child say anxiously to Chloe:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201272"><said direct=True>“I hope you don'</said><said direct=False>t mind. He will do it. We can't stop him.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201273"><said direct=True>“It comes of his having bronchitis so often, I think,”</said><said direct=False> said the stout child they called H.O. “It isn't really his fault.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201274"><said direct=False>There was an awkward pause while the pale child sucked my pencil and rolled his eyes. He made the most shocking grimaces I ever saw, but when Chloe turned anxiously to Oswald, he said,</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201275"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s all right; he's not ill; it's only the poetry working out of him.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201276"><said direct=False>Presently he stopped writing, folded the paper very small, and said suddenly and earnestly,</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201277"><said direct=False>“Have you got a secret staircase here?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201278"><said direct=False>We owned our indigence in this respect.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201279"><said direct=True>“We have at the Moat House,”</said><said direct=False> he said. “Have you explored your house thoroughly?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201280"><said direct=True>“Yes, I think so,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, with a glorious inspiration, adding, “but you may explore it if you like. Don't make too much hay, that's all! Off you go!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201281"><said direct=False>Noël pressed the paper into Chloe's hand and they rushed from the room, and as they went I heard the words “jolly good sort.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201282"><said direct=False>I drew a long breath.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201283"><said direct=True>“What a whirlwind!”</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201284"><said direct=True>“Children do make a difference in a house,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, wistfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201285"><said direct=True>“They do,”</said><said direct=False> I said, kissing her ears, “all the difference.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201286"><said direct=False>She gave me a doubtful glance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201287"><said direct=True>“My dear little old wife,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “people might think themselves lucky if their children were half as nice as these.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201288"><said direct=True>“They are dears, great dears,”</said><said direct=False> she said, and then we read Noël's poem:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201289"><said direct=False>TO THE BLUE PRINCESS LADY WITH THE LUNCH</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201290"><said direct=True>“Two poems in one day,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Oh, Chloe, beware of vanity.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201291"><said direct=True>“The dear!”</said><said direct=False> she said. “And, Len, it's not half bad, is it? What extraordinary children!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201292"><said direct=False>I could hear the wave of children surging wildly about the house. I lighted a cigarette, and strove for calm. I seemed to have been living in the embrace of a friendly tornado.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201293"><said direct=False>Chloe looked at me anxiously.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201294"><said direct=True>“They are dears,”</said><said direct=False> she said, for the fourth time. “I do hope they haven't worried you!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201295"><said direct=True>“Worry'</said><said direct=False>s not the word,” said I. “They have electrified, bewildered, enlightened. I never saw children with such energetic enthusiasms. The Morrison boy is a muff; but the others, they are very trusting. The world must have been kind to them.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201296"><said direct=True>“Anybody would be,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “and I hope the world always will.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201297"><said direct=False>There was a silence in the house. I went to see whether the exploring party had drowned itself in the rain-water cistern, which is just the sort of thing that kind of child would do. No; Mary said they were exploring the cellars. As she spoke I heard a thunderous report reverberating below. Our cellars are large and vaulted; from recollections of my childhood, I could conceive that they might seem well worth exploring. But I had not all Chloe's confidence in these strange children. From the little I had seen of them I felt that they were quite capable of organizing a Guy Fawkes play, and carrying it out with scrupulous, enthusiastic fidelity if one of their number should happen, as seemed only too likely, to have any matches and loose gunpowder in his pocket.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201298"><said direct=False>Yolande had just come from town, and by a curious coincidence our tenant had come on the same train. I left them talking to Chloe, and went down the cellar steps. Half-way down I was met by an incredibly cobwebby boy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201299"><said direct=True>“I was just coming after you,”</said><said direct=False> he said, eagerly. “Do you know, we've found a door behind some beer-barrels, and Oswald and Denny got in from behind under the dining-room floor; they're hammering on the other side of the door now. There are barrels in front of the door. We rolled one away. Did it make an awful row? They say there's all sorts of things inside. Did you know it was there? And please can we have a candle and matches? We've used all ours.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201300"><said direct=False>One-half at least of my foreboding was justified. I wondered where they had dropped the hot heads of all the matches they had used.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201301"><said direct=False>I got some candles and matches, and the cobwebbed child, whose name appeared to be Dickie, led me to a cellar where barrels were piled. Behind them I could just discern the shadowy outline of a door, from which came an intermittent knocking and voices:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201302"><said direct=False>“Have you got him?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201303"><said direct=False>“Can you get the barrels away?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201304"><said direct=True>“Can you get the door open, or shall we come back under the floor for the candles? It'</said><said direct=False>s a beastly tight fit, and I've split my waistcoat as it is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201305"><said direct=False>“The last match we lighted we saw some chairs and a mangle.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201306"><said direct=False>There were three boys still in evidence, and the tenant had followed me to see the sport. The girls were as energetic as the boys, and one by one we rolled the barrels away. Curious that Chloe and I had never looked behind those barrels. The door was not fastened. It opened easily, and a shower of dust and cobwebs fell on the heads of the explorers who first pressed forward.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201307"><said direct=False>From my soul I congratulated these children. Even to such an adventurous band as this an adventure so exciting could not happen every day.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201308"><said direct=False>They were quite right. There was furniture in the inner cellar, odds and ends stowed away, to make room for new stuff, by busy, thrifty hands now long since folded in lavish idleness—hands that, in their life-day, could never bear to destroy or to waste.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201309"><said direct=False>We carried the things up-stairs—all but the vast box-mangle and one other thing which I said I would carry up myself later.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201310"><said direct=False>We bore into the kitchen, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Chloe and Yolande, and the contemptuous temptuous ones of Mary, a full-sized oak dresser—in four pieces; five chestnut-wood chairs, more or less dilapidated; an oak settle—the seat was broken, but, oh, how our hearts rejoiced in the severe beauty of its panelled back! three ladder-backed chairs—seats gone; a large gate-table; an elm kneading-trough; and the magnificent wreck of a carved four-post bedstead!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201311"><said direct=False>The children were as delighted as we were, which is saying a good deal.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201312"><said direct=True>“I said we would,”</said><said direct=False> said the poet, triumphantly. “It's not gold, but it is nice. You have lots of nice things. I like the way you stick up warming-pans and brass candlesticks instead of plush brackets and crinkly ornaments.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201313"><said direct=False>A most discerning child, truly! When the children had been partially cleaned, our tenant invited them all to tea at his cottage. Yolande and Chloe went to help.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201314"><said direct=False>When they were gone I went down to the cellar and fetched the thing I said I would carry myself. I bore it up to the loafery and cleaned it, and polished it, and mended it a little, and set it by the hearth, in the glow of the fire; and that evening when Yolande and the tenant were deep in chess, I beckoned Chloe, and took her up to the loafery, and, lighting the candles, bade her look.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201316"><said direct=True>“Oh, Len,”</said><said direct=False> she cried, throwing her arms round my neck, “it's miles better than the one we go to look at in the shop in Great Portland Street!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201317"><said direct=True>“I meant to give you that for a Christmas present,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “but this is better.” She fell on her knees beside it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201318"><said direct=False>“Oh, look at the dear little daisy carving on the sides, and the little strong panelled hood, and the rockers! Oh, Len, it is lovely! Where did it come from?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201319"><said direct=True>“It was in the cellar,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Do you like it? No; it's absurd to thank me; thank those outrageous, dear Bastable children.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201320"><said direct=True>“I will,”</said><said direct=False> she said, coming nearer to me. “Len—I've said it before, I know, but they are dears—and they shall come and see the cradle they found when—when it's better worth looking at.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I will,” she said, coming nearer to me. “Len</said><said direct=True>—I've said it before, I know, but they are dears—</said><said direct=False>and they shall come and see the cradle they found when—when it's better worth looking at.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201321"><said direct=False>Presently my wife took me into our room, and, unlocking the corner drawer, showed me all that was in it. Little, little things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201322"><said direct=False>CHRISTMAS in the Red House was charming. It made us feel like pictures on Christmas cards. Chloe and I flatly refused to have anything to do with the decorations. We had had enough of evergreens when we decorated our drawing-room with the loops and swags for the great house-warming party. And rather than we would touch box or yew or laurel or holly again, the Red House should go undecorated. We said so, but our tenant insisted that no decorations at Christmas would be the first step towards the downfall of the British constitution and the death-blow to the naval supremacy of England.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201323"><said direct=True>“Let me do it,”</said><said direct=False> he said. “I've had my Christmases in such odd, out-of-the-way places—ships and ranches and diamiond-fields—I haven't put up a sprig of holly since I was a school-boy. Miss Riseborough, you'll help me, I know.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Let me do it,” he said. “I've had my Christmases in such odd, out-of-the-way places</said><said direct=True>—ships and ranches and diamiond-fields—</said><said direct=False>I haven't put up a sprig of holly since I was a school-boy. Miss Riseborough, you'll help me, I know.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201324"><said direct=True>“I know I won'</said><said direct=False>t,” said Yolande. “I never do things with my fingers. I'll inspect and direct and overlook, and earn the wages of superintendence, if you'll make Mary bake them—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201325"><said direct=True>“Scones, I suppose,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “There are heaps of string in the cellarette, and don't take my best scissors—the old ones are in the table drawer.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201326"><said direct=True>“How good we are growing,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Fancy you knowing where anything is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201327"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>re reformed characters,” she answered, gayly. “Where are the pencils and the India rubber?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201328"><said direct=False>I felt a pang. Was it possible that Chloe had any suspicion? Could she possibly guess that it was I, and not Yolande, who finished drawing her pictures for her? No, she certainly could not. And I more than half wanted to tell her my secret. Yet I could not make up my mind to part with it. I had nursed it in my heart till it had grown very dear and precious.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201329"><said direct=False>We left Yolande enthroned on the settle, di recting the labors of our tenant, but when the gong summoned us to tea and the wages-of-superintendence-scones, we found our tenant working at one end of the wreath, and Yolande busy at the other. It was not such a very long wreath as to have needed two pairs of hands, either. To do Miss Riseborough justice, she looked very much ashamed of this lapse from the principles of a lifetime.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201330"><said direct=True>“My hands are very dirty,”</said><said direct=False> she made haste to say, “and I think that many of the deserving poor would have been glad to add a little to their slender incomes by putting up your grimy evergreens for you; but—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201331"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t apologize,” I said. “We understand perfectly. We've infected you at last. It is nice to do things with one's hands, isn't it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201332"><said direct=False>“Not in the least. It is very tiresome and very fatiguing; but some one had to do it, it seems, and I at least could not sit by and see your tenantry ground down without a word of protest, or the holding out of a helping hand. I hope there are many, many scones, and very, very buttery. We deserve some reward.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201333"><said direct=False>After tea the work was resumed, and the hall, stairs, and white parlor were all hung with shining wreaths before dinner-time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201334"><said direct=True>“Yolande can work,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe to me, in confidence. “It's odd that her perverse abstention from really interesting things has not made her clumsy.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201335"><said direct=True>“As if a hand the shape of hers could ever be clumsy,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “any more than a hand like yours could ever grow coarse.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201336"><said direct=True>“It might have done,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “if you and I had gone on doing all the house-work. We ought to be very grateful to Yolande. She has practically organized the whole of our future for us. We are settled, fixed, planted—yes, that's it—we grow, ourselves, of course, but she has planted us in the right soil, with exactly the right aspect. Now our dear little characters can develop beautifully, and our hands keep pretty, and no wrinkles come in our nice, smooth foreheads. You've been a little I don't know what about Yolande. But you must own that what she undertakes she does well.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It might have done,” she said, “if you and I had gone on doing all the house-work. We ought to be very grateful to Yolande. She has practically organized the whole of our future for us. We are settled, fixed, planted</said><said direct=True>—yes, that's it—</said><said direct=False>we grow, ourselves, of course, but she has planted us in the right soil, with exactly the right aspect. Now our dear little characters can develop beautifully, and our hands keep pretty, and no wrinkles come in our nice, smooth foreheads. You've been a little I don't know what about Yolande. But you must own that what she undertakes she does well.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201337"><said direct=False>“Even to the red-branding of suspected fruit-thieves—yes.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201338"><said direct=False>Yolande was spending Christmas at the Red House, and, it being Christmas Eve, the tenant dined with us. We had a merry evening. We had lighted a huge fire in the big, empty drawing-room where the piano was; Chloe played waltzes, and Yolande danced with me and with the tenant. When the dancing was over Chloe and I sat by the fire and the others went out to look at the stars from the balcony.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201339"><said direct=True>“Ah, youth, youth!”</said><said direct=False> I sighed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201340"><said direct=True>“They will catch their deaths of cold,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, prosaically.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201341"><said direct=False>I whispered: “Chloe, in a very short time those people will come through that French window with the announcement of their engagement on their lips. This is the tamest love-affair I have ever witnessed. Everything has gone far too smoothly. Yolande has fallen in love obviously, bluntly, without any of those fine shades and nice feelings which you will remember to have noted in other cases—our own, for instance. She has grown rather dull.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201342"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t talk so loud,” said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201343"><said direct=True>“As for him,”</said><said direct=False> I went on, “happiness exudes from him like—like turpentine from the pine-tree, or oil from the skin of the castor, or beaver.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201344"><said direct=True>“I suppose when we'</said><said direct=False>re old we shall never talk nonsense,” she said. “I almost think you're getting too old for it now. Castor, indeed!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201345"><said direct=True>“No, I'</said><said direct=False>m not. Yes, we shall. We shall never grow old, because we shall always talk nonsense. Don't you think it would be nice and kind and thoughtful of us to go up to the loafery and leave them this room? I know she'll have an awful cold if she stays out there much longer. It's a terrible thing to celebrate your betrothal by a cold in the head.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201346"><said direct=False>So we spoke out into the starlit twilight of the balcony, and begged to be excused, and then we crept up-stairs and raked together the red embers of our loafery fire, and put logs on and crouched happily in low chairs on the hearthrug of our very own fire. Chloe knitted and I smoked happily and quietly till it seemed that we must no longer delay to go down and speed our parting tenant. It was, in fact, eleven o'clock. I was just knocking out my pipe on the hob when a light tap on the door mingled with my own tapping, and Yolande's face looked round the door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201347"><said direct=True>“Come in!”</said><said direct=False> we said, “come in!” But we wondered, because Yolande had never, since the day when in our pride we first showed it to her, crossed the threshold of that room. Now she came in and closed the door softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201348"><said direct=True>“He'</said><said direct=False>s gone,” she said. “He asked me to say good-night to you for him.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201349"><said direct=False>She came across the room and sat down on the hearth-rug at Chloe's feet. She leaned her arm on Chloe's knee and laid her face upon the arm.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201350"><said direct=True>“This is the room of all rooms for confidences,”</said><said direct=False> she said, after a silence. “That's why I thought I might come in just this once. I've got something to tell you—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201351"><said direct=False>Chloe and I successfully avoided each other's eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201352"><said direct=False>Another silence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201353"><said direct=True>“Shall I go away?”</said><said direct=False> I said, clumsily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201354"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t be silly,” she said. “It's nothing so very important, after all. Only I am afraid it will surprise you a little. I am rather surprised myself. As a matter of fact, I had never been so surprised in my life. It was not at all what I expected myself to do. What do you think I am going to be idiot enough to do?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201355"><said direct=False>We said, with as good an appearance of perfect ignorance as we could command, that we were sure we did not know.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201356"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m going to be married,” she said. “There!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201357"><said direct=False>It was difficult to express congratulatory surprise—so difficult that we failed utterly. Chloe threw her arms round Yolande's neck and began to laugh softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201358"><said direct=True>“You dear, silly, clever, blind, darling mole,”</said><said direct=False> she said. “Did you really think we were quite blind too—Len and I, who love you? My dear, we've known it from the very first, almost, and long before you did, I expect.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201359"><said direct=True>“Known what?”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, in a suddenly changed voice; but she returned Chloe's kisses.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201360"><said direct=True>“Why, everything, my pretty, clever, foolish child,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “We've been watching over you and loving you all the time, like two old birds with a young one who is just learning to fly.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201361"><said direct=True>“Oh, you have, have you?”</said><said direct=False> said Miss Riseborough, softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201362"><said direct=True>“Yolande, you don'</said><said direct=False>t mind our being glad, and saying so? It's all been so beautifully simple and straightforward and idyllic; none of those horrible romantic complications that one expects from a Girton girl's love-affairs.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201363"><said direct=True>“Oh, it has, has it?”</said><said direct=False> Yolande's voice was softer than ever. I felt in my bones that for some reason Chloe's gentle enthusiasm did not please.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201364"><said direct=True>“I will go and put up the shutters,”</said><said direct=False> I said, for I felt that I was out of place in this confidence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201365"><said direct=True>“No, don'</said><said direct=False>t,” said Yolande, with a curious stiffness in her voice. “Do you really mean, Chloe, that you have been imagining that—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201366"><said direct=True>“That the tenant worshipped the ground under your pretty feet?”</said><said direct=False> said my wife. “Well, yes.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201367"><said direct=True>“You are strangely mistaken,”</said><said direct=False> Yolande said, very deliberately. “I am going to marry a man you have never seen.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201368"><said direct=False>“Yolande!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201369"><said direct=True>“Then I must offer you more formal and less well-informed congratulations,”</said><said direct=False> said I. “What is his name?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201370"><said direct=False>There was a slight pause.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201371"><said direct=True>“Percival Forbes,”</said><said direct=False> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201372"><said direct=False>Our tenant's name was something quite different. A silence followed that none of us knew how to break. Chloe spoke first.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201373"><said direct=True>“My dear girl, how annoying you must have thought us. I am so sorry. I wish I hadn'</said><said direct=False>t said—I don't know what it was I did say.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201374"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s all right,” said Yolande, in an odd, stifled voice; “but really, if you want romance—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201375"><said direct=True>“Yolande, I don'</said><said direct=False>t understand you to-night.” Chloe was making horseshoes in her forehead. “Tell us what you wish to tell us. I am afraid of you. I don't like to ask you anything.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201376"><said direct=True>“Why should you, when it'</said><said direct=False>s so beautifully tame and idyllic? But I'll tell you a story if you like.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201377"><said direct=False>Chloe stroked her hair timidly, and I, in sheer embarrassment, refilled my pipe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201378"><said direct=True>“Imagine a young woman, tolerably well educated and very cocksure about everything. She meets a man, and they like each other. Then they quarrel—oh, never mind what about—and the man goes to India, and she is very sorry. And then he writes that he is coming back, and will she see him on Christmas Day? And she says yes—and to-morrow is Christmas Day. And all this time they'</said><said direct=False>ve both been perfectly miserable. Is that more romantic—and involved?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201379"><said direct=True>“Much,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, with conviction.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201380"><said direct=True>“But I don'</said><said direct=False>t like it so well, Yolande,” I said, “because there is more to the story. May I hit out straight from the shoulder?—as you said to Chloe once. Do you remember?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201381"><said direct=True>“Strike here,”</said><said direct=False> she said, remembering, and with a smile that seemed to me unmeaning she folded her hands over her heart.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201382"><said direct=True>“Well, then,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “this is, as you say, the room for confidences. It is the Palace of Truth.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201383"><said direct=True>“Not quite,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, still smiling.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201384"><said direct=True>“Well, it'</said><said direct=False>s jolly well going to be,” I said, in some irritation. “You must own, dear and foolish lady, that our mistake was natural. You have walked and talked, played chess, bicycled, gone to foot-ball matches, and remodelled your whole nature to please the tenant, and now—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201385"><said direct=True>“Remodelled my nature? How hateful! But I haven'</said><said direct=False>t.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201386"><said direct=False>“He at least will not be satisfied to know that all this was merely done to pass the time while you waited for your other lover—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201387"><said direct=True>“This is hitting without the gloves,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande; “but go on. It amuses me.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201388"><said direct=True>“It oughtn'</said><said direct=False>t to,” I said; “it won't amuse him. I like the tenant, and I think you've behaved atrociously to him. Now, forgive me for easing my mind, and let's never recur to the subject again.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201389"><said direct=True>“But,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, in a small, meek voice, “he is engaged to another girl—her name is Jane—and he happens to be his brother.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“But,” said Yolande, in a small, meek voice, “he is engaged to another girl</said><said direct=True>—her name is Jane—</said><said direct=False>and he happens to be his brother.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201390"><said direct=True>“And even so,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “if ever I saw true love in a man's eyes I've seen it in his when he looked at you. Jane, indeed! And all your interest in sport—the thing you used to hate most?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201391"><said direct=False>Yolande was silent a moment. Then she said: “Len, I haven't been scolded like this for years. I didn't know you cared enough about me to do it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201392"><said direct=True>“You don'</said><said direct=False>t know how much we do care,” said my wife, gently. “But, Len, what is the use?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201393"><said direct=True>“Suppose,”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, slowly, “one had quarrelled with the other one—the one in India—because he would hunt and one thought it cruel. Don't you think one might have tried to learn to like sport, for his sake?”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Suppose,” said Yolande, slowly, “one had quarrelled with the other one</said><said direct=True>—the one in India—</said><said direct=False>because he would hunt and one thought it cruel. Don't you think one might have tried to learn to like sport, for his sake?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201394"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>ve said my say,” said I, “and I hope you've forgiven me. Our tenant may be engaged to fifty girls, but it's you he loves—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201395"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> she said, softly. “Yes.” Then she flashed a dazzling, illuminating smile at us and put her chin in the air in the prettiest, proudest way. “Yes, I think it is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201396"><said direct=False>I think I may be pardoned for taking Yolande by the shoulders and shaking her as she held out to Chloe's eyes a trembling left hand on which shone the gold signet ring which I had noted a hundred times on our tenant's finger.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201397"><said direct=True>“Then why did you say it was so flat and unromantic, and drive me to inventing a romance for you? It was all your fault, Chloe. No, there isn'</said><said direct=False>t any man in India. There isn't any man at all but the one—there never has been. Now you're not to crow over me and say you told me so, for it's all quite different from what you think. We shall start on a basis of mutual esteem—no, you needn't laugh—and I will never sew a button on for him or make him a pudding as long as I live. Good-night. Thank you for your scolding, Len. I don't think I ever enjoyed anything so much in my life.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Then why did you say it was so flat and unromantic, and drive me to inventing a romance for you? It was all your fault, Chloe. No, there isn't any man in India. There isn't any man at all but the one</said><said direct=True>—there never has been. Now you're not to crow over me and say you told me so, for it's all quite different from what you think. We shall start on a basis of mutual esteem—</said><said direct=False>no, you needn't laugh—and I will never sew a button on for him or make him a pudding as long as I live. Good-night. Thank you for your scolding, Len. I don't think I ever enjoyed anything so much in my life.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201398"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>ll come and put you to bed,” said Chloe. “It's all Len's fault. If he hadn't been here I should never have put your dear, foolish back up. But I never thought you could have told such wicked stories. I am blind, and stupid, but I have wit enough left to unhook your gown and brush your hair. Come!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201399"><said direct=False>When they had gone I turned idly to the table. There lay an unfinished drawing of my wife's—a child with an impossibly foreshortened arm carrying a jug in two dimensions, on a head like a deformed cocoanut. I looked at it for a little while and then set to work. The sketch was spirited, and I had a certain pleasure in working it out, a pleasure so engrossing that I did not hear the door open, and my heart leaped like a fish with a pike after it as two hands fell on my shoulders, and I knew that my secret was discovered—that henceforth not Yolande, not the ghost, but I myself must carry the praise or blame due to the finisher of Chloe's pictures. I turned my head and kissed the hand that lay on my left shoulder, the hand with my wedding-ring on it. She ruffled my hair with the other hand, and, “Thank you, dear,” she said, simply.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201400"><said direct=False>“For the kiss?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201401"><said direct=True>“For that and everything—for all the trouble you'</said><said direct=False>ve taken with my silly drawings. I'm glad I caught you at it, you dear, industrious beaver. I've wanted to tell you—oh, for such a long time!—how clever you are, and how much better you draw than I do!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“For that and everything—for all the trouble you've taken with my silly drawings. I'm glad I caught you at it, you dear, industrious beaver. I've wanted to tell you</said><said direct=True>—oh, for such a long time!—</said><said direct=False>how clever you are, and how much better you draw than I do!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201402"><said direct=True>“But you thought it was Yolande—you know you did,”</said><said direct=False> I said, turning in my chair so that my arm could go round her as she stood.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201403"><said direct=True>“I know you thought I did,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “and I never could understand how you could think me so silly. Why, Yolande couldn't begin to do the drawings you've done! My silly boy, do you suppose I haven't got heaps and heaps of your old drawings put away? Did you really think that I shouldn't know your touch anywhere?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201404"><said direct=True>“I did; I was a fool, dear. And you'</said><said direct=False>re a darling. But I ought to quarrel with you. Good wives don't have secrets from their husbands, madam. Why did you pretend you didn't know?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201405"><said direct=True>“It wasn'</said><said direct=False>t my secret,” she said, blinking at me in surprise. “It was your secret. And you were so fond of it, I couldn't bear to take it from you. And I always thought you'd tell me some day. Wouldn't you have? Why didn't you? I gave you lots of chances. Don't you remember—when I asked what you wanted the India rubber for, and when I said it didn't matter which of us did the work?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201406"><said direct=True>“You said that about Yolande and the ghost and the writing,”</said><said direct=False> I reminded her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201407"><said direct=True>“Did I? Well the principle'</said><said direct=False>s the same, isn't it? You see how good and kind I am. I'm not a bit angry with you for keeping secrets from me. If I'd kept a secret like that from you you'd have been frightfully cross, wouldn't you?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201408"><said direct=True>“Ferocious. But then you couldn'</said><said direct=False>t,” I said, confidently. “And you really like the drawings?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201409"><said direct=True>“You know,”</said><said direct=False> she said; “and I'm so awfully pleased to see how clever you are. Len, I like you to be able to do some things better than me.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201410"><said direct=True>“I think I could talk better grammar,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “if I tried very hard indeed, with both hands and all my might.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201411"><said direct=False>“It was very nice and funny to see you nursing your dear little-big secret, and all the time it was mine, too.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201412"><said direct=True>“Madam,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “you have deceived and betrayed me. I will go and put up the shutters and forget my wrongs in sleep. Oh, by-the-way—Yolande?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201413"><said direct=False>We had both forgotten her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201414"><said direct=False>“She is very happy. I must have talked like a tract or an aunt to have driven her to such extremes. But it is all exactly as I said, perfectly simple and idyllic, and the happiest thing in the world—almost—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201415"><said direct=True>“Almost,”</said><said direct=False> said I. “And when are they to be married?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201416"><said direct=True>“Oh, almost directly. There'</said><said direct=False>s nothing to wait for. They are going to take on the other cottage and run a covered way across the garden, and have their kitchen and dining-room and her study there and his study and their sitting-room in the other one. They've arranged it all in the most delightfully practical and prosaic way. And she'll want her furniture. They are to have separate studies, and always knock at each other's study doors, and neither is to be offended if the other says: ‘You can't come in. I don't want you!’”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201417"><said direct=False>I laughed. “And the pupils?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201418"><said direct=True>“Oh, that'</said><said direct=False>s all over. She won't have any more pupils. She's going to write a book on the Higher Education of Women.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201419"><said direct=False>“And she wants her furniture? Well, we have the furniture that was in the cellar, and we can go about, by-and-by, and pick up beautiful odd things here and there. We can afford to now.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201420"><said direct=True>“I wish you'</said><said direct=False>d tell me one thing, Len,” said my wife.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201421"><said direct=False>“Well?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201422"><said direct=False>“Do you really like writing or drawing best?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201423"><said direct=True>“We make a good bit of money by both,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “I think we must give Yolande a very, very beautiful wedding-present—with our best love—and the ghost's!”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“We make a good bit of money by both,” I said. “I think we must give Yolande a very, very beautiful wedding-present</said><said direct=True>—with our best love—</said><said direct=False>and the ghost's!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201424"><said direct=False>She frowned a little.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201425"><said direct=False>“Yes, but quite apart from the money, which do you like doing best? Do tell me. Tell me straight out!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201426"><said direct=True>“Well, then,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “I've got rather fond of drawing; I suppose because it's not my work, but yours. As Yolande says, we are incurably prone to do anything rather than our own proper work.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201427"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “we are. Go and put up the shutters now, Len, and don't be hours about it, or I shall fancy you have met a burglar.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201428"><said direct=True>“My father met a burglar once,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “He heard a row and went down, and when he didn't come back my mother thought he might have been overpowered, so she took the bedroom poker and went down to his assistance.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201429"><said direct=True>“I should have gone with him,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “Well?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201430"><said direct=False>“Well, she went down very softly, and there was a light in the kitchen, and there was the burglar in the arm-chair, telling a piteous tale, and my father making cocoa for him over the spirit-lamp!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201431"><said direct=True>“He was a darling,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, “and so are you; but we're out of cocoa. You must give the burglar bottled beer instead. I'll stay here till you come back.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201432"><said direct=False>When I came back she was sitting in her favorite little rocking-chair.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201433"><said direct=True>“Come and sit down a little longer,”</said><said direct=False> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201434"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s very late,” said I, lowering myself to the hearth-rug at her feet.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201435"><said direct=True>“Yes; it'</said><said direct=False>s Christmas Day, I know, Len. We were talking about secrets just now, and you said I could never keep one from you. Would you be very angry if I did?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201436"><said direct=True>“I do not advise you to try,”</said><said direct=False> I said, taking her hands in mine. They were cold, and they trembled a little.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201437"><said direct=False>“But suppose I have? Will you be very angry?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201438"><said direct=False>“Tell me, and try.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201439"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s absurd,” she said, trying to laugh. “I always thought it would be so easy to tell you, and now it is so difficult. You must tell me things first—silly things—to give me courage.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It's absurd,” she said, trying to laugh. “I always thought it would be so easy to tell you, and now it is so difficult. You must tell me things first</said><said direct=True>—silly things—</said><said direct=False>to give me courage.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201440"><said direct=False>I told her several. Then we sat silent. Presently I said: “My pussy-kitten, have you really something serious to tell me? Or is it only that you are upset over this business of Yolande? Don't worry over trifles, dearest and best, but if there is really anything you want to tell me, tell me now. It can't be anything that it would hurt me to hear.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201441"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m not at all sure about that.” She spoke with a gleam of soft mischief in her eyes. “You're very kind and trusting, Len, but—oh—seriously, I believe you'll hate me when I tell you.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I'm not at all sure about that.” She spoke with a gleam of soft mischief in her eyes. “You're very kind and trusting, Len, but</said><said direct=True>—oh—</said><said direct=False>seriously, I believe you'll hate me when I tell you.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201442"><said direct=True>“Then tell me at once,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Don't tantalize me with this promise of a wholly new sensation.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201443"><said direct=False>“Oh, if you will make fun—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201444"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m not, but I won't have you make mountains out of mole-hills. Come, show me the mole-hill and we'll trample it together. Why, silly Chloe, your hands are like ice, and how they tremble! Out with it—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201445"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t think I'll tell you at all,” she said. “You ought to be clever enough to find out. Besides, you kept a secret from me, Len, and I wasn't angry.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201446"><said direct=False>Even then I didn't see.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201447"><said direct=False>She rose suddenly. “No, I won't tell you tonight,” she said. “You don't really want to hear it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201448"><said direct=False>I rose, too. “You will tell me to-night,” I said, holding her hands. “My dear, how can you tease me so?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201449"><said direct=False>She put her arms round my neck and whispered in my ear.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201450"><said direct=True>“And oh,”</said><said direct=False> she cried, “don't be cross! I can't bear it if you are.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201451"><said direct=True>“Cross! My dear, delightful, clever, wonderful derful genius of a pussy-kitten! If you only knew how I'</said><said direct=False>ve worried and wondered. And it was you all the time—you, you, you! Oh, what a fool I've been! But I've been punished for my folly. Chloe, I've come very near to hating Yolande, and all the time it was you—not Yolande or the ghost, but you, who were writing all those wonderful endings to my silly stories! Sit down on your throne and let me do you homage.” I put her back in the rocking-chair and knelt before her.</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Cross! My dear, delightful, clever, wonderful derful genius of a pussy-kitten! If you only knew how I've worried and wondered. And it was you all the time</said><said direct=True>—you, you, you! Oh, what a fool I've been! But I've been punished for my folly. Chloe, I've come very near to hating Yolande, and all the time it was you—</said><said direct=False>not Yolande or the ghost, but you, who were writing all those wonderful endings to my silly stories! Sit down on your throne and let me do you homage.” I put her back in the rocking-chair and knelt before her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201452"><said direct=True>“I meant to tell you at first,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “but when you thought it was Yolande, I thought it was so funny and stupid of you, because she doesn't really see half the things I put in the stories.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201453"><said direct=True>“Funny and stupid, indeed,”</said><said direct=False> I echoed. “You were wiser. You do see things. And tell me, Chloe, which do you like doing best—writing or drawing?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201454"><said direct=True>“Why, writing, of course!”</said><said direct=False> she said, “because it's not my work, but yours. Yolande was quite right.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201455"><said direct=False>“Then for the future you must put your name to the stories.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201456"><said direct=True>“Oh, must I?”</said><said direct=False> she asked, wistfully. “I thought it would be so nice if we put both our names. And to the drawings, too. Because you do invent plots better than I do, and I can do sketches. Then it would all be our work—not just yours or mine, but ours.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201457"><said direct=True>“Very well,”</said><said direct=False> I said; “better than well! Ours be it. As you've said once, or more than once, it doesn't matter a straw which of us does the work, as long as it is us, and not Yolande or the ghost.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201458"><said direct=True>“What about grammar now? And trying with both hands? Len, it'</said><said direct=False>s Christmas Day by the clock. I've got a present for you. It's a booken with pretty, pretty pikkies, but I sha'n't give it to you till it's real, live, wide-awake Christmas Day.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201459"><said direct=True>“You'</said><said direct=False>ve given me a most lovely present,” I said, “a beautiful brand-new secret of your very own. To think that my wife's an author—an author of genius! I never thought to see the day.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201460"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t peacock!” she said. “You've nothing to be so proud about. I'm as well off as you are. My husband's an artist—an artist of genius! But I knew all the time, didn't I, and you didn't, so I must be much cleverer than you, really.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201461"><said direct=True>“Isn'</said><said direct=False>t that what I've been saying? Twenty times cleverer and a thousand times as dear.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201462"><said direct=True>“I never could do sums,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “but I did manage to put two and two together about the drawings, and the answer was, ‘You!’”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201463"><said direct=True>“One and one is a better sum,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “and easier, and the answer is, ‘Us.’”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201464"><said direct=True>“And what about grammar now?”</said><said direct=False> said she.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201465"><said direct=False>YOLANDE was married—she was married at Elmhurst church, Chloe and I her only supporters. And after the wedding we all walked quietly down together from the church and said “Good-bye” to them at the door of their cottage, through whose windows the welcoming firelight shone out into the cheerless January dusk.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201466"><said direct=True>“What an ideal beginning to a honey-moon!”</said><said direct=False> said my wife. “Fancy walking straight home to your own house. No broughams and slippers and things, no long railway journey and horrid hotels and lodgings, with the rice dropping out of you in showers every time you move an inch, and everybody grinning sympathetically after you. It's like Frances's wedding in the Professor.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201467"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s a warmer wedding than that,” said I, “That description always chills me to the bone, And does it matter so much where you go, as long as you go together? I seem to remember a hideous parlor at Pevensey that once contented two moderately happy people.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201468"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “but this is best. Who knows how much happier we should have been if we'd gone straight home to the Bandbox?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201469"><said direct=True>“We should never have been able to leave it,”</said><said direct=False> said I. “It's better as it is. Suppose I had been wise and firm and inflexible—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201470"><said direct=False>“A youthful Murdstone—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201471"><said direct=False>“And refused to yield to your superior wisdom and obstinacy, and—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201472"><said direct=True>“And we had never come to the Red House! Yes, it'</said><said direct=False>s all my doing, Len—the only thing I'm really and truly proud of. It's Yolande's doing, partly, but it's mine, too. Our lines have fallen unto us in pleasant places. Come in. I feel as if it was us who had just been married and were going home to our own house. It's odd—I always feel that we've only just been married, and yet that we've been married ever since we can remember.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“And we had never come to the Red House! Yes, it's all my doing, Len</said><said direct=True>—the only thing I'm really and truly proud of. It's Yolande's doing, partly, but it's mine, too. Our lines have fallen unto us in pleasant places. Come in. I feel as if it was us who had just been married and were going home to our own house. It's odd—</said><said direct=False>I always feel that we've only just been married, and yet that we've been married ever since we can remember.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201473"><said direct=True>“So we have,”</said><said direct=False> said I.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201474"><said direct=True>“We are very fortunate,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “and I am very, very grateful.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201475"><said direct=False>We were, indeed, fortunate. Chloe's daring adoption of the Red House as our home had been generously repaid. Instead of being the white elephant as which it had sometimes sought to disguise itself, it was now a credit to us, and an unchanging joy. Our cottages were let, and our garden. Our work in the Red House had been prosperous, the memories that had grown up there were precious, the hopes more precious still. Mary was happier than ever, now that she had a small servant—her slender personality wholly justified by our prosperity and our future—to teach and order about and be kind to. Our lives were peaceful, ordered, incredibly pleasant. And if I still sometimes cleaned a candlestick or a sword, and Chloe now and then washed china or dusted the white parlor, not even Yolande could complain that we neglected our work to indulge in these recreations.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201476"><said direct=False>Chloe remarked one day that we had grown uninteresting. Our earlier domestic adventures, she declared, might have been made really amusing by a competent narrator, but now nothing happened to us except the things that ought to happen.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201477"><said direct=True>“Ah, wait,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “my regretful optimist; things will go on happening to us all our lives long. This is only an ‘easy.’ We are in a peaceful backwater just now. We shall be pulling against the stream again soon enough.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201478"><said direct=True>“But we are uninteresting,”</said><said direct=False> she persisted.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201479"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s not polite of you to say so. Even the plural pronoun doesn't redeem that speech. I don't find you uninteresting—at least, not very.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201480"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s all quite dull and flat,” she went on, scorning to take up the gauntlet; “and the worst of it is, it is so beautiful when things are flat and dull. I hardly dare to draw my breath for fear something should happen. Things that happen are always horrid. It's the times when nothing happens that are too good for one to dare to be quite happy in them.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201481"><said direct=True>“Nice things do happen sometimes,”</said><said direct=False> I said, softly. “Besides, we have the interest of watching Yolande just now. She won't elude our vigilance forever; sooner or later she'll justify your prediction and be discovered darning the tenant's socks.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201482"><said direct=True>“Even that won'</said><said direct=False>t be a very wonderful happening,” said my wife; “though so far, I confess, she has lived up to her ideals most nobly. He supports her in her resolution to keep her fingers clean of house-work, and the ferret's wife does all her sewing. It's us that things don't happen to any more. And, oh, Len, I don't want anything to happen. Don't you notice that we hardly ever even quarrel now?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201483"><said direct=False>“Did we ever—much?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201484"><said direct=False>“We used to be snarky sometimes—much snarkier than we are now. Why is it? Is it because we have more money? People are always supposed to quarrel when they are poor.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201485"><said direct=True>“We were never poor enough to throw the teacups at each other'</said><said direct=False>s heads,” I said, “even in our worst days. Look at that little gold ball.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201486"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s winter aconite,” she informed me. “It has a prettier name, but I've forgotten it. It's very late. I suppose it overslept itself; the others are over long ago.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201487"><said direct=False>We were walking slowly round the garden, where the crocuses showed green and gold, and the birds were singing like mad. The spikes and buds of the daffodils made green patches, and the blue squills were out. The pigeons on the farm-roof were preening their shining breasts, nestling up to each other, repeating unceasingly the pretty, monotonous, proud cry of their pairing-time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201488"><said direct=True>“You can hear quite well what they'</said><said direct=False>re saying,” said Chloe. “Listen: ‘Look at us two! Look at us two!’ They are absurdly happy.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201489"><said direct=True>“So they ought to be,”</said><said direct=False> I said; “it's a happy day. There's no doubt at all now that spring will come again. I've only half believed it all these winter months. How neat that market-gardener man has made everything! I do hope we sha'n't loathe it in the summer when we walk in it and remember how sweet and untidy and all-over-the-place it was last year. That would be a happening, indeed.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201490"><said direct=True>“If we are both alive and in this garden together in the summer we sha'</said><said direct=False>n't hate anything much, shall we? Very well, I won't, if you hate it so, but it's silly not to face things. People do die sometimes, you know, even people who love each other.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201491"><said direct=True>“I won'</said><said direct=False>t have it,” I said, firmly. “Dearest and silliest, you must not scratch my heart with those kitty claws of yours, or I shall be sorry I ever let you have it to play with. I'd rather quarrel with you. As you say, we've neglected that pastime shockingly. Let us begin. Come, think of something to quarrel about, and you shall see what reserve forces of crude disagreeableness I have been getting ready all these dear months. Ah, don't, don't! You know it always makes you ill to cry.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201492"><said direct=False>For she was clinging to me and hiding her eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201493"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t,” I heard her say. “I don't want to claw you. It claws me just as much. You don't know how silly I am. I can't bear to let you out of my sight, because, perhaps, I sha'n't be able to be with you very much longer. Len dear, we know each other so well; we've been such friends, too, haven't we? We've been so happy. It makes me frightened. And now it's so peaceful; I feel as if things were gathering together for some awful thing to happen. You don't know!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201494"><said direct=False>I was silent. Did I not know?</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201495"><said direct=True>“Yes, you do,”</said><said direct=False> she went on, holding me more closely. “You do, you do, but you pretend you aren't afraid of anything, because you think it makes me cheerful. It doesn't. I hate to think that we're pretending to each other—now. So I tell you plainly, Len, I'm very, very frightened, and you know it, and so are you, and I know that, and if you'd only let me look straight at it, perhaps I shouldn't be so frightened. Oh, there are so many things I want to say to you. There, I won't any more. Let me take your arm, and we'll walk quietly and respectably like good children, and you must let me say anything I like, and you mustn't try not to say everything that comes into your head, and you're not to try to cheer me up, because I can't bear it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201496"><said direct=False>So we walked and talked. And, indeed, such talk, while it intensified my own aching passion of tenderness and solicitude, did, by its frank revelation of that passion, do more to calm and cheer my wife than all my brave pretence —it was brave—of confident fearlessness had ever done. But I have written already more than is needed. It is because, when I remember that time, I cannot well command my thought; and my pen, seeing its superior officer in mutiny, mutinies too. For it was March now, and the time of our great fear and our great happiness was very near.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201497"><said direct=False>Strangely enough, after that day it was Chloe who made the brave pretences and I who clung to her, imploring her to teach me her courage and confidence. Once again in the history of the Red House my wife and I had changed parts.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201498"><said direct=False>The hushed peace that brooded over us folded us in wings too soft and close to let any breath of outside tempest come near. Yolande and the tenant talked to us, as it were, through a soft, warm veil. Our relations—oh, fortunate destiny that was ours!—kept away. Chloe's mother (who is as nice as any one could be who is not Chloe, and is twice Chloe's age) sprained an opportune ankle and could not come to us as she had intended, and as I had thought I wished. So that my wife and I had these last days—the last, as we alternately prayed and feared—alone together. The doings of Yolande and Yolande's husband were like a bright, gay embroidery on the rich fabric of our quiet happiness. And the time drew near.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201499"><said direct=False>It was on the 1st of April—a too appropriate date, as Yolande afterwards bewailed—that Chloe suddenly realized, in an imperative shock, that there was a certain Japanese dressing-jacket pattern without which she could not be happy another moment. She had the stuff to make it, a demurely eccentric Eastern-patterned silk; she also had the material—a dull, soft blue—for what she called the revers. I suppose a man would call it the lining, but I am not quite sure.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201500"><said direct=False>So she left a half-written story of the very strongest possible “domestic interest” (it was, indeed, for she was to get twenty pounds for the finished article) to go down to Yolande's cottage and borrow this priceless pattern which Yolande was known to possess. She had bought it among others for the guidance of the dressmaker who prepared her trousseau. And I, almost without a pang, abandoned a nearly finished drawing to go with her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201501"><said direct=False>The buds were gray and green on the trees, on the lilacs the buds were bronze, and carmine on the creeper. The daffodils were out, and the tulips rigid with the energy of pride and promise. Everything that makes the glory of the summer garden was pushing up green leaves and crying: “I am coming, I am coming—only be patient! And don't disturb me, for I am very busy making flowers for you. Wait, and you shall see!” The birds' song was almost as intense as in the first pairing-time. We walked up the neat cottage garden, and we remembered the days of Prosser and the rags and the dead mouse and the mutton-bone. Now the garden was all trim and neat, and the earth had stirred in her sleep and thrown out handfuls of primroses and violets and early red tulips, just to show what she could do, and to remind us what she would do for us when the sun, her lover, had kissed her fully awake.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201502"><said direct=False>We knocked at the cottage door. It was a very nice knocker—old brass. Yolande—under my guidance—had picked it up for sevenpence at a rag-and-bottle shop in Deptford. There was a long pause. Usually the door was opened almost coincidently with the fall of the knocker by pretty, fair-haired, cheery-faced Mrs. Bates, but now we stood long on the narrow doorstep and heard from within sounds of scuffling and rustling. We had time to see how right Browning was when he said, “The leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,” and how very long before their white perfection come the green pledges of the annunciation lilies.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201503"><said direct=False>We knocked again. The scuffle or rustle assured us that some one was within. The leisure of our next waiting showed us the auriculas—“honey-flowers” our grandmothers used to call them; “dusty millers” the country-folk call them still—glowing in their soft shades of primrose and orange and red and purple.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201504"><said direct=False>But when one desires, with all one's soul, the cut-out paper pattern of a Japanese dressing-jacket for which one has already the material, even auriculas cannot charm away desire for long.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201505"><said direct=False>This time it was Chloe who knocked; she knocked vehemently, and almost on the instant the door was opened by our tenant in person—our tenant, resplendent in speckless frock-coat and gleaming high hat—the armor in which he habitually leaves his home to fight with beasts in the newspaper-offices of Fleet Street.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201506"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m rushing for my train,” he said, hurriedly, and, indeed, its smoke showed already beyond the gray veil of leaf-buds on the trees of our railway embankment. “I'm glad you've come. I wanted to send for you yesterday, but Yolande wouldn't—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201507"><said direct=False>“Whatever is the matter?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201508"><said direct=True>“Oh, nothing—a domestic crisis. Yolande'</said><said direct=False>s coping with it. She loathes a crisis in little, but she's coping with it with the detail of a dictionary and the generalship of a—of a general. I've no time to turn the phrase.” He tore off down the red path, shouting as he went, “I say, Yo, I'll bring home something cold for dinner.”</said></p>
</sample>
<sample><p n="ENG190201069"><said direct=True>“Let me kill it, mum,”</said><said direct=False> said Bates.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201070"><said direct=True>“Or would you like to, mum?”</said><said direct=False> asked Jim, kindly. “It was your rabbit, so it was! You just hold it up by the ears like this, and hit it a crack 'longside o' the head with the edge of your hand—so—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Or would you like to, mum?” asked Jim, kindly. “It was your rabbit, so it was! You just hold it up by the ears like this, and hit it a crack 'longside o' the head with the edge of your hand</said><said direct=True>—so—</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201071"><said direct=False>But Chloe had fled, still clasping the rabbit, and leaving us to look helplessly at each other.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201072"><said direct=True>“Ladies are no good at sport,”</said><said direct=False> said Bates, philosophically. “It's their tender hearts, bless them—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201073"><said direct=True>“Missus '</said><said direct=False>ll let it loose in the garden, I shouldn't wonder,” said Jim, in gloom.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201074"><said direct=True>“Better luck next time,”</said><said direct=False> said the tenant, cheerfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201075"><said direct=False>I left them to recover the ferret and arrange another siege. I found Chloe by the white-parlor fire stroking the rabbit, as it lay panting and wretched on her knee.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201076"><said direct=True>“Well, spoil-sport?”</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201077"><said direct=True>“Oh, Len, how could you—how could you let me? You knew what it would be like! Oh, did you hear it scream? It was like a little, little baby that some one was hurting! Don'</said><said direct=False>t go back to them. Promise me you'll never, never, never hunt rabbits again!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201078"><said direct=False>I shrugged my shoulders.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201079"><said direct=True>“I told you you wouldn'</said><said direct=False>t like it,” I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201080"><said direct=True>“I know, but you ought to have beaten me and locked me up, rather than let me go! I didn'</said><said direct=False>t know, poor, poor little rabbity! I didn't know!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201081"><said direct=False>“What are you going to do with it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201082"><said direct=True>“Keep it, of course,”</said><said direct=False> she said, opening her eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201083"><said direct=True>“Wouldn'</said><said direct=False>t it be happier if we let it loose again in the orchard?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201084"><said direct=True>“For some other ferret to go after? Never! Fancy running for your life with a long, crawling horror coming after you in the black dark, all cruel teeth and claws, and just when you think you are safe, and see the safe, green, light world outside where you can run and hide, you rush into a net and get beaten to death! You must give away the ferrets! You must! I won'</said><said direct=False>t bear it!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201085"><said direct=False>I shrugged my shoulders again. “Anyway,” I said, “the rabbit is slowly dying of fright in your arms. He doesn't know when he is well off.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201086"><said direct=False>I got a basket and some cabbage leaves. We shut in the rabbit and watched him through the cracks of the basket till we saw him recover enough to nibble.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201087"><said direct=True>“Now,”</said><said direct=False> she said, ”if you care the least bit about me you'll go straight back to those hateful people and tell them to stop. Yolande was quite right. She nearly always is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201088"><said direct=False>I admitted that in this case Yolande had chosen the better part.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201089"><said direct=True>“And don'</said><said direct=False>t bring those hateful ferrets back. I don't want ever to see them again.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201090"><said direct=False>“But what am I to do with them?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201091"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t care,” said Chloe, with almost a sob; ”anything—give them away, drown them, strangle them.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201093"><said direct=True>“Oh, Chloe! Chloe!”</said><said direct=False> I said, “your own little ferrets that have eaten out of your hand and climbed round your neck? Drown them? Strangle them? Never! I will advertise them in the Bazar and Mart in exchange for goldfish or anything useful, and Bates shall keep them till I find a purchaser.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201094"><said direct=True>“All right,”</said><said direct=False> she said, impatiently, “only go now. Go! Or they'll have killed another.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201095"><said direct=False>They had killed three. The soft, fluffy bodies lay side by side on the brown turf, and even as I came upon the scene there was a rustle and a scream—I thought of Chloe, and I hated to hear it—and next moment Yolande—yes, Yolande herself—rose from beside the hole with a live rabbit struggling in her hands among meshes of net.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201096"><said direct=True>“Here,”</said><said direct=False> she said, gently disengaging its helpless little feet from the netting and holding it tip tenderly by the ears, “you kill it, Jim. I think you do it quicker than the others. And that makes four.” She turned her back on the executioner and met my eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201097"><said direct=True>“Yolande,”</said><said direct=False> I cried, “this cruel sport—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201098"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s not really cruel,” she protested, “and it's very exciting. I'd rather die like that myself than die slowly of starvation when I got too old to go out after my food. That's the end of wild animals, you know, if we don't eat them. Isn't it?” She appealed almost abjectly from me to the tenant, who said, “That's so!” And I knew she was rehearsing those arguments by which he had drawn her down from her apple-tree to share in the sport.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201099"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m very sorry,” I said, “but the sport is now over. My wife decrees a reprieve to the rabbits, and banishes the ferrets. Bates, I wish you'd cart them off and get rid of them somehow.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201100"><said direct=False>The sporting party exchanged blank glances. Yolande's was the only comment.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201101"><said direct=True>“Well!”</said><said direct=False> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201102"><said direct=False>Jim and Bates collected the ferrets in a silence full, I knew, of disparaging reflections on woman's folly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201103"><said direct=False>Yolande and the tenant stood a moment talking before they strolled off together, and I heard him asking her why she should not ride out on her bicycle with him to see some coursing—only a thirty-mile ride.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201104"><said direct=True>“But I don'</said><said direct=False>t think I do approve of it, really,” she was saying, “not when I'm cool and collected and in my right mind—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201105"><said direct=True>“But you will not be cool and collected when you see the first hare get up. You will be wild with excitement. You'</said><said direct=False>ll forget everything else.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201106"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know that I want to.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201107"><said direct=True>“Yes, you do; you don'</said><said direct=False>t want to cultivate nerves. If you don't like sport—well, it's simple enough, and half the best women there are don't, either. If you do like it—well, you do, and so do the other half of the best women in the world. That's all there is to it. And you do like sport. Look here, if I could get a man to take on my work for Tuesday, we could start early, say about nine. Do say you will.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Yes, you do; you don't want to cultivate nerves. If you don't like sport</said><said direct=True>—well, it's simple enough, and half the best women there are don't, either. If you do like it—</said><said direct=False>well, you do, and so do the other half of the best women in the world. That's all there is to it. And you do like sport. Look here, if I could get a man to take on my work for Tuesday, we could start early, say about nine. Do say you will.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201108"><said direct=False>I did not hear what she said, for they had strolled off down the path that leads to the moat, and when next I saw them they were engineering the leaky punt under the middle arch of the old bridge. Yolande in her blue cloth and fox fur was standing in an inch and a half of water, and hanging on to a muddy punt-pole; the tenant was instructing her.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201109"><said direct=False>Yolande! I shrugged my shoulders for the third time that day, and I went in to my wife. She was sitting by the fire in the beech-wood rocking-chair, singing low to herself; the song sounded like “Bye, baby bunting.” I suppose the rabbit put it into her head.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201110"><said direct=False>I never regretted that rabbit. In three days it was perfectly tame; in a week it played with the cats and sat up on the hearth-rug, unconcernedly washing its face. At the end of a fortnight it flopped after Chloe, in and out, up-stairs and down-stairs, like a small and very plump kangaroo. When the cats grew too catty in their play the rabbit would turn round and use his deadly hind foot. They presently learned to respect this, and the rabbit was master of the hearth-rug.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201111"><said direct=False>Yolande went to see that coursing, I believe, though she never spoke to Chloe of it. And she listened to tales of tigers from the tenant—more tales, and less convincing, than I should have thought any Girton girl could have borne. She also learned to take rose-cuttings, and did it without gloves. I looked on in a frenzy of annoyance, which I hid, even—indeed, most of all—from Chloe. The tenant is a man of ideas—but I never heard him talk anything but the visible—concrete to Yolande. I felt a horrid suspicion that he thought her a bit of a prig, and that he was actually daring to try to “form her”; the audacity took my breath away. But Yolande was placid, and seemed to breathe without effort.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201112"><said direct=False>Mindful of that scorned suggestion of my wife's on the night of the first dinner-party at the cottage, I looked straight before me and cultivated an air of seeing nothing. I sometimes wondered whether Yolande imagined that we did not see anything, or whether she knew we saw anything, and did not care, or whether she really believed that there was nothing to see. She had arranged, as usual, to personally conduct three model young persons on a winter tour through the art treasures of Italy, and her going was fixed for the week after Christmas. She had some private pupils, and went up to struggle with them two or three times a week, but for the most part she was with us. And I was glad to have her—first, because she is ever a sight for sore eyes, and secondly, because I began to see that I did not want either to give up my ghost-fathered pencil-work, nor yet, for some obscure reason which I can't even indicate, to confess to Chloe that it was not Yolande, but I, who had tinkered her drawings. My own work, my writing, grew less and less important to me—only the Weekly Wilderness still commanding the service of habit.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201113"><said direct=False>The curious change whose initial throes I had felt when first we came to the Red House had worked in Chloe and in me, till now, while the house was usually tidy to distraction, Chloe's wardrobes and chests were in the wildest confusion.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201114"><said direct=True>“I know,”</said><said direct=False> she said one day, when I opened a drawer and silently confronted her with a swollen mass of lace, ribbons, handkerchiefs, scarfs, bead necklaces, letters, collars, wristbands, brass- headed nails, and the long-lost hammer, all inextricably tangled up with the ball of twine I had been looking for—“I know. You see, it is so important to keep the house tidy—and I do tidy up.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I know,” she said one day, when I opened a drawer and silently confronted her with a swollen mass of lace, ribbons, handkerchiefs, scarfs, bead necklaces, letters, collars, wristbands, brass- headed nails, and the long-lost hammer, all inextricably tangled up with the ball of twine I had been looking for</said><said direct=True>—“I know. You see, it is so important to keep the house tidy—</said><said direct=False>and I do tidy up.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201115"><said direct=True>“You do, indeed,”</said><said direct=False> I said, fishing up from the bottom of the drawer the penknife that I had missed since last Tuesday week.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201116"><said direct=False>“Oh, I am so sorry. But I do forget so where things are.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201117"><said direct=True>“Now, I don'</said><said direct=False>t. I never tidy up, but I always know where to find my pencils, and I'm never in any doubt as to where I put the India rubber.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201118"><said direct=True>“What do you want with India rubber, anyhow?”</said><said direct=False> she asked, and I trembled for my secret.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201119"><said direct=True>“I meant that you are,”</said><said direct=False> I said, feebly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201120"><said direct=True>“Perhaps,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “if you would tidy up a little sometimes, I could keep the insides of things tidier. Let's have a grand clearing up now, this instant minute, and then I really will try! I must learn to be tidy, Len, before I'm too old to learn anything.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201121"><said direct=False>We did have a grand clearing up, beginning with that corner drawer. When all was neat—the scarfs folded, the ribbons rolled, the handkerchiefs restored to the historic handkerchief-case—I tried the other drawer. It was locked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201122"><said direct=True>“Oh, that'</said><said direct=False>s tidy,” she hastily assured me.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201123"><said direct=True>“What'</said><said direct=False>s in it?” I asked, idly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201124"><said direct=True>“Oh, nothing much—only little things. I'</said><said direct=False>ll show you some day when we've nothing to do but to be kind to each other. Now we'll go and clear out the sideboard cupboards and all the rest of it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201125"><said direct=False>We did. We found many things—the lost corkscrew and the button-hook and the Nineteenth Centuries that were missing. It took us all day, and when it was done there was a place for nearly everything, and everything that had a place was in it. The residue loomed hateful on a tray in the hall—odd stoppers, screws, knobs, handles of knives, curtain rings—all the litter that has no place and that one cannot bear to throw away. We looked at it in despair. Then I caught up the tray.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201126"><said direct=True>“Come, light of my eyes,”</said><said direct=False> I cried, exulting; “there is only one thing that we need—a lumber-room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201127"><said direct=False>We toiled joyously to the top of the house, I with the tray and Chloe with the little copper coal-scuttle whose broken handle we meant to get mended when we could afford it. We chose a fair-sized room, out of the many disused ones, opened the shutters, and dumped down our treasures on the floor. Our old tendency to furnish one room at the expense of another came irresistibly sistibly upon us, and we ransacked the house, carrying off to the lumber-room everything we could possibly not want. The house looked very bare when we had done, and for weeks I found myself toiling up those stairs in search of some necessary for one of us which the other had confiscated as “rubbish”—but we certainly had a most impressive lumber-room.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201128"><said direct=True>“And now,”</said><said direct=False> said my wife, looking round with pride, “clearing up will be simply a pleasure.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201129"><said direct=False>Yolande was severe as ever when she came back from watching a foot-ball match at the Rectory Field, and found us, very dirty and very happy, resting on the stairs.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201130"><said direct=True>“Dear Babes in the Wood,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “did they invent a new, pretty game to waste their time on?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201131"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>d rather waste my time at a game I can play than one I can only look on at,” said I, severely. “Sit down; there are plenty of stairs.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201132"><said direct=True>“Thank you. As to games, c'</said><said direct=False>est selon,” she said, unfastening her furs. “By-the-way, before I go to southern climes I should like to render an account of my stewardship. I'll write it down. Give me a pencil, somebody, and the back of an envelope.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201133"><said direct=False>She wrote busily for some time, then handed ed the paper to Chloe, who took it in her little grimy hand and read aloud:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201134"><said direct=False>“SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF AN AMATEUR AGENT</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201135"><said direct=False>“1. Getting one good servant to keep her situation by letting her keep her husband in it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201136"><said direct=False>“2. Letting cottage to ferret at £15 a year.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201137"><said direct=False>“3. Getting the Prosser rat turned out.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201138"><said direct=False>“4. Letting other cottage for £35.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201139"><said direct=False>“5. Dyeing fruit-thief (a failure).</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201140"><said direct=False>“6. Letting garden and orchard to market gardener for £20 a year and as much fruit and vegetables as you require.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201141"><said direct=False>“Yolande, you never have!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201142"><said direct=False>She rose and bowed. “Go on,” she said; and Chloe, merely pausing to embrace her, went on:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201143"><said direct=False>“7. Letting small cottage to foreman of market gardener for £17 a year.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201144"><said direct=False>“Oh, Yolande, this is too much! You really are a genius! And only one failure.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201145"><said direct=True>“And that was half a success,”</said><said direct=False> said I. “Oh, Yolande, what a glorious baking of beautiful pies! And yet you said you would never have a finger in any pie again.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201146"><said direct=True>“I can'</said><said direct=False>t help it,” she pleaded. ”I was born to it. Give me another envelope—no, not one with so many post-marks—and I'll make a brief financial statement.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I can't help it,” she pleaded. ”I was born to it. Give me another envelope</said><said direct=True>—no, not one with so many post-marks—</said><said direct=False>and I'll make a brief financial statement.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201147"><said direct=False>She scribbled again. This is what she wrote: By 1 ferret's rent £15 " 1 large cottage rent 35 " 1 small " " 17 " 1 garden 20 " 1 uncle deceased 200 Stories, output and price estimated on past 6 months 160 Illustrations on past 3 months 187 Total £634</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201156"><said direct=True>“There'</said><said direct=False>s your yearly income! How's that for high?” she asked, flashing a glance of triumph at us.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201157"><said direct=False>We had known well enough that our income was increasing, that we no longer had, as Chloe said, to look all round every shilling. We had told Yolande, gleefully, the amount of every check we had received. But we had kept no accounts. She had.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201158"><said direct=False>We all three fell into each other's arms, or something very like it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201159"><said direct=True>“You shall have that book of Beardsley drawings for a Christmas present, Len,”</said><said direct=False> said my wife, “and Yolande shall have a gold horseshoe brooch with turkisses in it, as becomes a sporting lady.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201160"><said direct=True>“It wouldn'</said><said direct=False>t become a bailiff and house agent,” said Yolande.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201161"><said direct=True>“Never mind. You shall have a bangle with a double dangling heart—ours—and an inscription inside that would get you a situation anywhere. And Chloe shall have—”</said><said direct=False> I stopped.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201162"><said direct=False>“What, Len?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201163"><said direct=True>“A very beautiful present, indeed. Something we never thought we'</said><said direct=False>d have. No, I won't tell you. It's going to be a surprise.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201164"><said direct=False>Yolande had taken off her veil, folded it very carefully, and driven three little turquoise-headed pins through it. Now she said, “I'm beginning to think that surprises are the best things in life—especially when one surprises one's self.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201165"><said direct=True>“Have you surprised yourself lately?”</said><said direct=False> Chloe asked, picking up the rabbit by its ears. It had followed her, as usual.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201166"><said direct=True>“Very much.”</said><said direct=False> I held my breath. The very cigarette trembled in my dusty fingers. Could it be that already that tenant had taught Yolande to be surprised at herself? A sigh of relief broke from me as she went on: “I am absolutely astounded—and charmed too, of course—at my own cleverness. But all this is a swan-song. I shall have my finger in no more pies—for good or ill. My career of usefulness is at an end. Henceforth I shall be a female fogy; never a pie shall be the worse nor the better for me. I shall cram young geese. No more and no less. Mark my words, I have gone up like the rocket, and like the stick I shall come down—if I have not already.” She took off her hat, and twisted the blue velvet and fur in her hands. “Mine is indeed a dark and terrible lot!” she said, smiling brilliantly at us. Then without more words she withdrew.</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Very much.” I held my breath. The very cigarette trembled in my dusty fingers. Could it be that already that tenant had taught Yolande to be surprised at herself?

<p n="ENG190201167"><said direct=False>Chloe sighed, not sadly: “Poor, dear Yolande! I do really believe she doesn't know what is the matter with her.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201168"><said direct=True>“And what is?”</said><said direct=False> I ventured.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201169"><said direct=False>“Make your own diagnosis.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201170"><said direct=False>“Yours is?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201171"><said direct=False>Silence.</said></p>

<p n="ENG190201173"><said direct=False>“Oh, nothing! Len.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201174"><said direct=False>“Well?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201175"><said direct=True>“I think I'</said><said direct=False>m glad.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201176"><said direct=False>“What of?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201177"><said direct=False>“About her.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201178"><said direct=False>“What about her?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201179"><said direct=True>“Oh, don'</said><said direct=False>t be tiresome!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201180"><said direct=False>“What, do words fail you in a crisis? Mine are at flood.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201181"><said direct=True>“No, don'</said><said direct=False>t! You know what I mean.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201182"><said direct=True>“I understand you to mean that you rejoice to see Othello'</said><said direct=False>s occupation gone. You are glad that your friend has renounced her dearest pastime and will finger her neighbors' pies no more.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201183"><said direct=True>“Dog in the manger!”</said><said direct=False> said my wife.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201184"><said direct=True>“No,”</said><said direct=False> I said, eagerly. “I'm almost sure that I'm not quite sorry.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201185"><said direct=False>“For what?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201186"><said direct=False>“For her.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201187"><said direct=False>“Why should you be?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201188"><said direct=True>“Because I see,”</said><said direct=False> I answered, slowly, “what you mean me to see—whether she knows it or not, she'll soon be baking her own pies.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201189"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe; “she'll understand then.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201190"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> said I; “one understands many things when one bakes at home.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201191"><said direct=True>“UGH-R-R-R!”</said><said direct=False> I remarked, as we sat down to breakfast.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201192"><said direct=True>“I suppose it is,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, pretending to shiver. “The Bandbox was warmer, certainly, but not much. Why do people make so much fuss about being too cold and too hot? Isn't it odd that they've never found out the great truth—that one has to be cold in the winter and hot in the summer? And if one has to be cold, how much warmer it is to be cold here than in the Bandbox!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201193"><said direct=True>“You mean that great possessions warm the cockles o your heart,”</said><said direct=False> I said; “that's because you're all soul. As for me, I must warm my hands in the tea-cozy before I can carve the eggs.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201194"><said direct=False>The white parlor, with its dark-panelled walls, its olive-green curtains, its sparkling brass and silver, and nothing white about it save the ceiling ing and the table-cloth, was a delightful picture of a breakfast-room. Chloe's loose gown of turquoise-colored soft stuff with its brown furry trimmings became her to distraction. I told her so.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201195"><said direct=True>“But the tip of your pretty nose is pink,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “It was quite white—with rage, I believe—the day you bit me so about my shaving-brush. Do you remember? And then the letter came enclosing the Red House and all our affluence! You had on some muslin thing that day—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“But the tip of your pretty nose is pink,” I said. “It was quite white</said><said direct=True>—with rage, I believe—</said><said direct=False>the day you bit me so about my shaving-brush. Do you remember? And then the letter came enclosing the Red House and all our affluence! You had on some muslin thing that day—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201196"><said direct=False>She shivered, almost in earnest this time, and poured out the coffee.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201197"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t talk of muslin!” she said. “Look, isn't it fairyland? Only it's a little hard to believe that our green garden has only gone to sleep, and means to wake up again in the spring.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201198"><said direct=False>A light veil of snow lay on our green garden now, and on the thatched roof of the old summer-house and on the sun-dial's face, whose sentimental expression had decided my wife to decide me to decide to live at the Red House. The snow lay in sheets, like cotton-wool, on the flat tops of the cedars; and the ivy round the windows, the creepers on the old arches, and the leaves of the tall box hedge were all outlined in sparkling white.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201199"><said direct=True>“It is a little different,”</said><said direct=False> I said; “that day, when you wore—well, I won't, then—and we had haddock for breakfast, and the letter came. By-the-way, my hands are warm enough to open letters now.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It is a little different,” I said; “that day, when you wore</said><said direct=True>—well, I won't, then—</said><said direct=False>and we had haddock for breakfast, and the letter came. By-the-way, my hands are warm enough to open letters now.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201200"><said direct=False>There were only two. One was a bill for repairs to the roof—the roof, now spread with snow, where one warm, wet morning we had fought a flood with brooms and a dust-pan; a bill that did not discompose me, for I was used to that roof. No living plumber could make its repairs permanent. The other letter was type-written, and that by a somewhat inexperienced hand. It read thus: Junior Blackheath Society of Antiquaries & Field Club. Dear Sir% At a Meeting of the Committe of thes dg Society it wasagreedt that a field day should.) be held on Dec 20 when the Society proposis to visit the interesting church of (x) Elmhurst andalsotheold Palace they call Kin (gons)Johns.

I; am dear Sir, Yours faithfully, Edward Turnbull Hon. Sec. P%S¼ Please excuse mistakes% ihave not learned the typewriter properyl yet.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201206"><said direct=False>Such was the letter. The more obvious orthographical errors had been carefully corrected with blue pencil, but, even so, the document was a remarkable one. Chloe read it, taking absent bites at her buttered toast.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201207"><said direct=True>“Mad?”</said><said direct=False> she queried, calmly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201208"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know; the letter's very conventionally worded, except in one or two odd places. Is it possible that a genuine society could possibly employ such a ghastly rough-sketch of a typist?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201209"><said direct=True>“The letter'</said><said direct=False>s not signed,” she remarked. “The secretary's name is typed as well as the rest.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201210"><said direct=True>“I knew a solemn ass named Turnbull, once,”</said><said direct=False> I reflected, “but I thought he'd got into a bank somewhere in Kent—Tonbridge or Dartford, or something. He used to fool around with brass rubbings and dates and archæological bores—”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I knew a solemn ass named Turnbull, once,” I reflected, “but I thought he'd got into a bank somewhere in Kent</said><said direct=True>—Tonbridge or Dartford, or something. He used to fool around with brass rubbings and dates and archæological bores—</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201211"><said direct=True>“I expect it'</said><said direct=False>s the same man,” she said, indifferently. “But we don't want the nasty society bothering here, do we? Write and tell him there's nothing to see, and no one really important ever lived here till we did.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201212"><said direct=True>“I don'</said><said direct=False>t know,” I said. “I wish I could be sure. Blackheath seems an unlikely place for it. If we were Woolwich, now, that simply bristles with improving societies; but I've a sort of idea this is a working-men's society. If the poor beggars have got a holiday on purpose, and are really interested—or think they are—it seems a bit piggy not to let them, doesn't it? We can keep a lookout from the loafery window and see that they don't get into any mischief. They only want to look at the house ‘from the outside.’”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I don't know,” I said. “I wish I could be sure. Blackheath seems an unlikely place for it. If we were Woolwich, now, that simply bristles with improving societies; but I've a sort of idea this is a working-men's society.

We can keep a lookout from the loafery window and see that they don't get into any mischief. They only want to look at the house ‘from the outside.’”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201213"><said direct=False>“I suppose they give an address?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201214"><said direct=True>“Yes; Morden House, Blackheath. It sounds decent. I'</said><said direct=False>m almost certain it's a workman's club. I'll write and tell them they can come. You don't really mind?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201215"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m not wholly a piggy-wig. But that letter's odd, all the same. Perhaps it's from a gang of thieves who want to come and see how the shutters are fastened.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201216"><said direct=True>“Well, they can'</said><said direct=False>t see that from the garden. Madam, I am beginning to realize that I am a proud man the day. Think of our position six months ago. Who would have wished to come and inspect, ‘from the outside, of course,’ our late lamented Bandbox? And now we are lords of the manor, holding the power of life and death over the field-days of antiquarian societies.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201217"><said direct=True>“What I don'</said><said direct=False>t like,” she went on, quite unappeased by this feudal picture, “is that about the skating. Why should antiquaries want to skate?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201218"><said direct=True>“Now to me,”</said><said direct=False> I rejoined, “that's the most convincing touch of all. Of course these workmen don't often get a holiday, and they want to make the most of it. ‘If the frost holds’ is a charming touch. It's hardly begun yet.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201219"><said direct=False>It did not hold. I signified to Mr. Edward Turnbull my gracious consent, and from that moment the snow began to melt, and the weather to settle itself down into something quite as warm and sunny as an English April, and far warmer than many an English May. A stray furze-bush or two at the end of our paddock broke into golden flower, and the skylarks sang in the pale blue above the orchard. The 20th was a day of cloudless beauty, and even in the midst of my mental congratulations to the members of the Antiquarian Society on their royal weather, I found room for a pang of sympathy pathy for those among them who might have had their skates ground.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201220"><said direct=False>I recurred again that day, I remember, to our old life at the Bandbox. We were sitting in the loafery, now made cosey with curtains and a big wood fire. Chloe sat sewing in her rocking-chair. She had had some verses that morning, and, bad as they were, they had pleased her. There were seven stanzas, I remember. The first two were quite ordinary, and the other five got sillier and sillier, till at the end they were a mere jingle of nonsense—a sort of nursery rhyme, mostly written in the “little language.” The poem—Chloe really did call it a poem—began something like this:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201221"><said direct=False>TO CHLOE AT WORK</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201222"><said direct=False>She liked it all, even the nonsense of the last five stanzas, and she said that she liked it none the less because it happened to be written on the backs of a green-grocer's bill, the voting-card of a candidate for the school board, and two odd envelopes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201223"><said direct=False>She said: “It is very pretty, Len. I didn't know you ever noticed whether I was sewing or not.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201224"><said direct=True>“You don'</said><said direct=False>t know my observant nature,” I said, “and after all these years of married life, too.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201225"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s more than one year, anyway,” she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201226"><said direct=False>“Do you remember the day when you made me decide to leave the dear Bandbox?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201227"><said direct=False>“Shall I ever forget it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201228"><said direct=False>“And that other dear day when you invented the loafery and we looked at the bars?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201229"><said direct=True>“Let'</said><said direct=False>s look at them now,” she cried, jumping up and dropping scissors, thimble, tapemeasure, and a mass of lace and muslin. When I had picked everything up we went to the window. The creeper's leaves were gone now, and we stood between dull red curtains and looked out on the misty garden, where the dead leaves lay, patches of wet gold and brown in the faint sunlight, and where a robin on a leafless apple-tree was singing his very best, and pretending to the rooks in the elms that he was a thrush disguised in a scarlet waistcoat.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201230"><said direct=True>“Those Antiquarian brutes,”</said><said direct=False> I said, presently, “they'll be here directly. By Jove! they are here. They look horribly small. Can it be that the Junior Blackheath only admits dwarfs?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201231"><said direct=True>“Those can'</said><said direct=False>t be the Antiquaries,” Chloe cried. “Why, Len, they look like children! Lots and lots of them. What can they want? They look like a slice of a strayed, frayed school treat. And they've all got books, and they don't seem to have got any grown-up people with them. Oh, do go and turn them out!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201232"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>ll go and find out what they want—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201233"><said direct=True>“Oh yes, and they'</said><said direct=False>ll say they're botanizing, or geologizing, or something, and you'll let them stay, like you did the boys that wanted conquerors off the chestnut-trees, and overran everything. I've not forgotten it; I'll go myself.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201234"><said direct=False>She ran down the stairs, slipped her feet into the wooden sabots that she keeps for sudden winter garden excursions, and stumped off angrily down the path under the cedars. I took a short-cut between Jim's celery-trenches. Chloe is terrible in her wrath, but if it grows too hot it boils over in tears of rage; and I did not wish Chloe to cry, and I not there.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201235"><said direct=False>The invaders were grouped round the sundial. All had their backs to us, and one of them was reading aloud. I caught a few words:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201236"><said direct=False>“....told the time when Charles the First was beheaded, and recorded the death-devouring progress of the Great Plague and the Fire of London. There is no doubt the sun often shone even in those devastating occasions, so we may picture—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201237"><said direct=False>Then the reader heard the unmistakable threat in the emphatic stump, stump of Chloe's wooden shoes, and stopped short. Her eyes were angry, her mouth expressed inhospitable intentions. I thought I heard a murmur of, “Oh, Crikey!” from the reader, but the next moment he had stepped towards my wife and taken off his cap with an oddly graceful flourish. He was a boy; there were other boys, who followed his lead in cap-doffing. There were girls, too, rosy-faced little girls in highwayman coats and scarlet Tam-o'-Shanters. The whole invading company were, as Chloe had said, “children.” And all wore spectacles.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201238"><said direct=True>“Do you know that this is a private garden?”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, severely. “You are trespassing, you know.” Her voice is very pretty, even when she is angry, and she was not nearly so angry as she had been before the boys took their caps off.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201239"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s not your garden, is it?” asked the smallest boy of all, goggling at her through his spectacles, and speaking in an off-hand but perfectly agreeable manner. One of the girls shook him gently, and bade him shut up.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201240"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>re most awfully sorry,” said the boy who had been reading. “We wouldn't have come if we'd thought you'd mind, but we've got a pass, so I thought it was all right. Here, hold my spectacles half a sec., Alice, and I'll find it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201241"><said direct=False>The prettiest of the red-capped girls took the spectacles, and the boy felt in several pockets, while I drew near to offer Chloe my moral support.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201242"><said direct=True>“Here it is!”</said><said direct=False> he said, at last, disentangling a dingy paper from a mass of string, matches, envelopes, putty, and cobbler's wax, and, with really a rather nice bow, he handed to Chloe—my letter to the Antiquarian Society!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201243"><said direct=True>“But this was not meant for you,”</said><said direct=False> she said. “This is to Mr. Turnbull—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201244"><said direct=True>“That was my fault,”</said><said direct=False> said a younger boy—a thin, pale, anxious-looking child. “We tossed up who should copy out the letter on Albert's uncle's type-writer, and I was thinking about something else, so I copied it, name and all.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201245"><said direct=False>Chloe put her hands to her head with a gesture of despair. I said: “Just think a minute. Remember, we've no idea what all this is about. Just tell us, right away from the beginning, how you came to be here, and what you want.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201246"><said direct=False>There was a silence. Then the eldest girl said, “Oswald, you tell.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201247"><said direct=False>The boy who had been reading twisted his cap, and stood uneasily on one foot. But almost at once he planted his feet firmly on the ground and began, looking Chloe straight in the eyes with a most disarming frankness.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201248"><said direct=False>“First of all, we are very sorry the lady is vexed, and we beg her pardon.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201249"><said direct=True>“That'</said><said direct=False>s all right,” said Chloe, unexpectedly. “Go on.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201250"><said direct=True>“Well—when we were staying in the country some Antiquaries wrote to Albert'</said><said direct=False>s uncle—this is Albert”—he pushed forward a shy boy in velvet knickerbockers—“and asked him to let them come and see his house. And we thought we should be feeling a bit slack in the holidays, so we thought we'd play at being antiquaries. And Albert's uncle showed us this place once from the train when we were going to Bexley Heath, and he said some great person lived here once, and it was a historic place, and we can't remember who it was. And he said a clever writer lived here now, and he told us the name. So we wrote to ask leave to come, and you gave it right enough.”</said></p>

<p n="ENG190201251"><said direct=False>The voice was reproachful.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201252"><said direct=True>“Yes,”</said><said direct=False> I said, completely melted by this unexpected recognition of my—or the ghost's—talent as a writer. “Are you Mr. Edward Turnbull?”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Yes,” I said, completely melted by this unexpected recognition of my</said><said direct=True>—or the ghost's—</said><said direct=False>talent as a writer. “Are you Mr. Edward Turnbull?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201253"><said direct=True>“Rather not”</said><said direct=False>—his tone was somewhat injured. “I was coming to that. We decided to copy out the letter that the real Antiquity secretary sent to Albert's uncle, and Noël had to do it, because we tossed up about it, and he lost. And he got thinking of a poem he's writing, and copied it, name and all—and only remembered it after we'd licked the stamp for the letter. So we thought it didn't matter. And if you'd rather we'd been Mr. Turnbull, you wouldn't have if you'd seen how thin his legs are, and how he couldn't laugh because his mouth was so tight.”</said></p>

<p n="ENG190201254"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>d much rather have you,” said Chloe, smiling ing; and as she smiled I could see how deeply all present fell in love with her on the instant. “I'm sorry I didn't understand. We won't interfere any more. You'd like to go on reading your papers. Who wrote them?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201255"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>ve each done one,” said the eldest girl—she was a little prim, and not so pretty as the others—”only mine is all out of a book, because it is so difficult to think of things.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“We've each done one,” said the eldest girl</said><said direct=True>—she was a little prim, and not so pretty as the others—</said><said direct=False>”only mine is all out of a book, because it is so difficult to think of things.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201256"><said direct=True>“Do you always wear spectacles?”</said><said direct=False> I asked.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201257"><said direct=False>They all laughed. It was a very pleasant sound, this peal of young laughter in our old garden.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201258"><said direct=True>“Oh no!”</said><said direct=False> said the prettiest girl, “only to make us look like learned antiquities—antiquaries, I mean. It was an awful bother collecting them all; some of them have no glass in.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201259"><said direct=True>“One more question,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “If you're not Edward Turnbull, who are you?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201260"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>re the Bastables,” the biggest boy said, with a sort of shy pride, as if he were confessing, in his modesty's despite, to royal lineage. “I'm Oswald, and these are Alice and Dora; Noël's the one who typed the letter; and this shaver is H.O.; and these are Daisy and Denny Foulkes; and Albert Morrison I told you about before.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201261"><said direct=True>“You'</said><said direct=False>ll have lunch with us, won't you?” asked Chloe, abruptly, picking up her blue train and fixing her feet in her wooden shoes. “I don't think there'll be much, but we can make out with bread and jam—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201262"><said direct=True>“I like you,”</said><said direct=False> said the smallest boy, before the others could answer. “I like you very much, indeed, and I'll have lunch with you, whatever it is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201263"><said direct=False>The others murmured thanks, and we left them to their play.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201264"><said direct=True>“Aren'</said><said direct=False>t they perfect dears?” said Chloe, when we were out of earshot. “I don't like the Morrison boy, but the others are lovely. Why aren't all children nice?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201265"><said direct=True>“They all are—if they have nice grown-ups belonging to them,”</said><said direct=False> I said, enunciating lightly a tremendous dogma. “But, darling and reckless one, do you know that there's nothing in the house but cold neck of mutton, and even that, if I remember right, is invidiously distinguished as being not the best end?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201266"><said direct=True>“I know,”</said><said direct=False> she said; “but you must go up to Elmhurst and get things: tinned tongue—children always adore tongue—and candied pineapple and tangerine oranges in silver paper, and nuts, and bananas. Oh, I do think children are so nice! I wish these weren't so big. The smallest boy, the one they call H.O., he's simply a duck.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I know,” she said; “but you must go up to Elmhurst and get things: tinned tongue</said><said direct=True>—children always adore tongue—</said><said direct=False>and candied pineapple and tangerine oranges in silver paper, and nuts, and bananas. Oh, I do think children are so nice! I wish these weren't so big. The smallest boy, the one they call H.O., he's simply a duck.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201267"><said direct=True>“Oswald for my money,”</said><said direct=False> said I, “and Alice! Make a list of what I'm to get, and I'll be off. It's half-past twelve now.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201268"><said direct=False>I left Chloe laying the table for eleven in the white parlor. When I came back the cloth was spread, but Chloe had vanished. I found her in the garden submerged to the shoulders in a wave of children, and she carried nine pairs of spectacles in her hand. We all went in to lunch. I was now a mere outsider. Chloe, by some art unknown to me, had become one of the children, and was the most childlike child of all. The others really were not bad children. I don't think I ever met any so full of enthusiastic energy. As a permanency, they might have been a little wearing, for, strong in Chloe's extraordinary assumption of esprit de corps, they now threw away all shyness, and talked to us with simple directness of adventures, of contemporary literature, of the ways of Providence, and their own vital ambitions. They had a very full flow of conversation, and a much larger vocabulary than I remember having at their age. What struck me most was their confident assumption that, now we knew them, we could not help liking them; and the assumption was, I own, justified. This assumption was particularly marked in Oswald. He evidently thought a good deal of himself, but, as I could not but reluctantly acknowledge, with some justice! They were extremely “free in their talk,” as Mary said afterwards, but never vulgar. And they were very much funnier than they meant to be. The lunch, for which Chloe had madly brought out the best green-and-gold table-centre, charmed them. I had not thought that Chloe could be so thoroughly inspired with any menu. When no one could eat any more, the children looked at each other, and Dora, the prim one, said, quite unconscious of the evidence of rehearsal with which her speech bristled,</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201269"><said direct=False>“Thank you very much for letting us come, and for having us to lunch.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201270"><said direct=True>“And for getting such a jolly lunch,”</said><said direct=False> said the pale boy. “I think it is splendid. If you will give me a piece of paper and a pencil I will write you a piece of poetry about it.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201271"><said direct=False>While I was getting these I heard the prim child say anxiously to Chloe:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201272"><said direct=True>“I hope you don'</said><said direct=False>t mind. He will do it. We can't stop him.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201273"><said direct=True>“It comes of his having bronchitis so often, I think,”</said><said direct=False> said the stout child they called H.O. “It isn't really his fault.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201274"><said direct=False>There was an awkward pause while the pale child sucked my pencil and rolled his eyes. He made the most shocking grimaces I ever saw, but when Chloe turned anxiously to Oswald, he said,</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201275"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s all right; he's not ill; it's only the poetry working out of him.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201276"><said direct=False>Presently he stopped writing, folded the paper very small, and said suddenly and earnestly,</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201277"><said direct=False>“Have you got a secret staircase here?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201278"><said direct=False>We owned our indigence in this respect.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201279"><said direct=True>“We have at the Moat House,”</said><said direct=False> he said. “Have you explored your house thoroughly?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201280"><said direct=True>“Yes, I think so,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, with a glorious inspiration, adding, “but you may explore it if you like. Don't make too much hay, that's all! Off you go!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201281"><said direct=False>Noël pressed the paper into Chloe's hand and they rushed from the room, and as they went I heard the words “jolly good sort.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201282"><said direct=False>I drew a long breath.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201283"><said direct=True>“What a whirlwind!”</said><said direct=False> I said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201284"><said direct=True>“Children do make a difference in a house,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, wistfully.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201285"><said direct=True>“They do,”</said><said direct=False> I said, kissing her ears, “all the difference.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201286"><said direct=False>She gave me a doubtful glance.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201287"><said direct=True>“My dear little old wife,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “people might think themselves lucky if their children were half as nice as these.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201288"><said direct=True>“They are dears, great dears,”</said><said direct=False> she said, and then we read Noël's poem:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201289"><said direct=False>TO THE BLUE PRINCESS LADY WITH THE LUNCH</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201290"><said direct=True>“Two poems in one day,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Oh, Chloe, beware of vanity.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201291"><said direct=True>“The dear!”</said><said direct=False> she said. “And, Len, it's not half bad, is it? What extraordinary children!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201292"><said direct=False>I could hear the wave of children surging wildly about the house. I lighted a cigarette, and strove for calm. I seemed to have been living in the embrace of a friendly tornado.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201293"><said direct=False>Chloe looked at me anxiously.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201294"><said direct=True>“They are dears,”</said><said direct=False> she said, for the fourth time. “I do hope they haven't worried you!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201295"><said direct=True>“Worry'</said><said direct=False>s not the word,” said I. “They have electrified, bewildered, enlightened. I never saw children with such energetic enthusiasms. The Morrison boy is a muff; but the others, they are very trusting. The world must have been kind to them.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201296"><said direct=True>“Anybody would be,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “and I hope the world always will.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201297"><said direct=False>There was a silence in the house. I went to see whether the exploring party had drowned itself in the rain-water cistern, which is just the sort of thing that kind of child would do. No; Mary said they were exploring the cellars. As she spoke I heard a thunderous report reverberating below. Our cellars are large and vaulted; from recollections of my childhood, I could conceive that they might seem well worth exploring. But I had not all Chloe's confidence in these strange children. From the little I had seen of them I felt that they were quite capable of organizing a Guy Fawkes play, and carrying it out with scrupulous, enthusiastic fidelity if one of their number should happen, as seemed only too likely, to have any matches and loose gunpowder in his pocket.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201298"><said direct=False>Yolande had just come from town, and by a curious coincidence our tenant had come on the same train. I left them talking to Chloe, and went down the cellar steps. Half-way down I was met by an incredibly cobwebby boy.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201299"><said direct=True>“I was just coming after you,”</said><said direct=False> he said, eagerly. “Do you know, we've found a door behind some beer-barrels, and Oswald and Denny got in from behind under the dining-room floor; they're hammering on the other side of the door now. There are barrels in front of the door. We rolled one away. Did it make an awful row? They say there's all sorts of things inside. Did you know it was there? And please can we have a candle and matches? We've used all ours.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201300"><said direct=False>One-half at least of my foreboding was justified. I wondered where they had dropped the hot heads of all the matches they had used.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201301"><said direct=False>I got some candles and matches, and the cobwebbed child, whose name appeared to be Dickie, led me to a cellar where barrels were piled. Behind them I could just discern the shadowy outline of a door, from which came an intermittent knocking and voices:</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201302"><said direct=False>“Have you got him?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201303"><said direct=False>“Can you get the barrels away?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201304"><said direct=True>“Can you get the door open, or shall we come back under the floor for the candles? It'</said><said direct=False>s a beastly tight fit, and I've split my waistcoat as it is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201305"><said direct=False>“The last match we lighted we saw some chairs and a mangle.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201306"><said direct=False>There were three boys still in evidence, and the tenant had followed me to see the sport. The girls were as energetic as the boys, and one by one we rolled the barrels away. Curious that Chloe and I had never looked behind those barrels. The door was not fastened. It opened easily, and a shower of dust and cobwebs fell on the heads of the explorers who first pressed forward.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201307"><said direct=False>From my soul I congratulated these children. Even to such an adventurous band as this an adventure so exciting could not happen every day.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201308"><said direct=False>They were quite right. There was furniture in the inner cellar, odds and ends stowed away, to make room for new stuff, by busy, thrifty hands now long since folded in lavish idleness—hands that, in their life-day, could never bear to destroy or to waste.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201309"><said direct=False>We carried the things up-stairs—all but the vast box-mangle and one other thing which I said I would carry up myself later.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201310"><said direct=False>We bore into the kitchen, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Chloe and Yolande, and the contemptuous temptuous ones of Mary, a full-sized oak dresser—in four pieces; five chestnut-wood chairs, more or less dilapidated; an oak settle—the seat was broken, but, oh, how our hearts rejoiced in the severe beauty of its panelled back! three ladder-backed chairs—seats gone; a large gate-table; an elm kneading-trough; and the magnificent wreck of a carved four-post bedstead!</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201311"><said direct=False>The children were as delighted as we were, which is saying a good deal.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201312"><said direct=True>“I said we would,”</said><said direct=False> said the poet, triumphantly. “It's not gold, but it is nice. You have lots of nice things. I like the way you stick up warming-pans and brass candlesticks instead of plush brackets and crinkly ornaments.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201313"><said direct=False>A most discerning child, truly! When the children had been partially cleaned, our tenant invited them all to tea at his cottage. Yolande and Chloe went to help.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201314"><said direct=False>When they were gone I went down to the cellar and fetched the thing I said I would carry myself. I bore it up to the loafery and cleaned it, and polished it, and mended it a little, and set it by the hearth, in the glow of the fire; and that evening when Yolande and the tenant were deep in chess, I beckoned Chloe, and took her up to the loafery, and, lighting the candles, bade her look.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201316"><said direct=True>“Oh, Len,”</said><said direct=False> she cried, throwing her arms round my neck, “it's miles better than the one we go to look at in the shop in Great Portland Street!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201317"><said direct=True>“I meant to give you that for a Christmas present,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “but this is better.” She fell on her knees beside it.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201318"><said direct=False>“Oh, look at the dear little daisy carving on the sides, and the little strong panelled hood, and the rockers! Oh, Len, it is lovely! Where did it come from?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201319"><said direct=True>“It was in the cellar,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Do you like it? No; it's absurd to thank me; thank those outrageous, dear Bastable children.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201320"><said direct=True>“I will,”</said><said direct=False> she said, coming nearer to me. “Len—I've said it before, I know, but they are dears—and they shall come and see the cradle they found when—when it's better worth looking at.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“I will,” she said, coming nearer to me. “Len</said><said direct=True>—I've said it before, I know, but they are dears—</said><said direct=False>and they shall come and see the cradle they found when—when it's better worth looking at.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201321"><said direct=False>Presently my wife took me into our room, and, unlocking the corner drawer, showed me all that was in it. Little, little things.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201322"><said direct=False>CHRISTMAS in the Red House was charming. It made us feel like pictures on Christmas cards. Chloe and I flatly refused to have anything to do with the decorations. We had had enough of evergreens when we decorated our drawing-room with the loops and swags for the great house-warming party. And rather than we would touch box or yew or laurel or holly again, the Red House should go undecorated. We said so, but our tenant insisted that no decorations at Christmas would be the first step towards the downfall of the British constitution and the death-blow to the naval supremacy of England.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201323"><said direct=True>“Let me do it,”</said><said direct=False> he said. “I've had my Christmases in such odd, out-of-the-way places—ships and ranches and diamiond-fields—I haven't put up a sprig of holly since I was a school-boy. Miss Riseborough, you'll help me, I know.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“Let me do it,” he said. “I've had my Christmases in such odd, out-of-the-way places</said><said direct=True>—ships and ranches and diamiond-fields—</said><said direct=False>I haven't put up a sprig of holly since I was a school-boy. Miss Riseborough, you'll help me, I know.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201324"><said direct=True>“I know I won'</said><said direct=False>t,” said Yolande. “I never do things with my fingers. I'll inspect and direct and overlook, and earn the wages of superintendence, if you'll make Mary bake them—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201325"><said direct=True>“Scones, I suppose,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “There are heaps of string in the cellarette, and don't take my best scissors—the old ones are in the table drawer.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201326"><said direct=True>“How good we are growing,”</said><said direct=False> I said. “Fancy you knowing where anything is.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201327"><said direct=True>“We'</said><said direct=False>re reformed characters,” she answered, gayly. “Where are the pencils and the India rubber?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201328"><said direct=False>I felt a pang. Was it possible that Chloe had any suspicion? Could she possibly guess that it was I, and not Yolande, who finished drawing her pictures for her? No, she certainly could not. And I more than half wanted to tell her my secret. Yet I could not make up my mind to part with it. I had nursed it in my heart till it had grown very dear and precious.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201329"><said direct=False>We left Yolande enthroned on the settle, di recting the labors of our tenant, but when the gong summoned us to tea and the wages-of-superintendence-scones, we found our tenant working at one end of the wreath, and Yolande busy at the other. It was not such a very long wreath as to have needed two pairs of hands, either. To do Miss Riseborough justice, she looked very much ashamed of this lapse from the principles of a lifetime.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201330"><said direct=True>“My hands are very dirty,”</said><said direct=False> she made haste to say, “and I think that many of the deserving poor would have been glad to add a little to their slender incomes by putting up your grimy evergreens for you; but—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201331"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t apologize,” I said. “We understand perfectly. We've infected you at last. It is nice to do things with one's hands, isn't it?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201332"><said direct=False>“Not in the least. It is very tiresome and very fatiguing; but some one had to do it, it seems, and I at least could not sit by and see your tenantry ground down without a word of protest, or the holding out of a helping hand. I hope there are many, many scones, and very, very buttery. We deserve some reward.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201333"><said direct=False>After tea the work was resumed, and the hall, stairs, and white parlor were all hung with shining wreaths before dinner-time.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201334"><said direct=True>“Yolande can work,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe to me, in confidence. “It's odd that her perverse abstention from really interesting things has not made her clumsy.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201335"><said direct=True>“As if a hand the shape of hers could ever be clumsy,”</said><said direct=False> I said, “any more than a hand like yours could ever grow coarse.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201336"><said direct=True>“It might have done,”</said><said direct=False> she said, “if you and I had gone on doing all the house-work. We ought to be very grateful to Yolande. She has practically organized the whole of our future for us. We are settled, fixed, planted—yes, that's it—we grow, ourselves, of course, but she has planted us in the right soil, with exactly the right aspect. Now our dear little characters can develop beautifully, and our hands keep pretty, and no wrinkles come in our nice, smooth foreheads. You've been a little I don't know what about Yolande. But you must own that what she undertakes she does well.”</said></p>
<said direct=False>“It might have done,” she said, “if you and I had gone on doing all the house-work. We ought to be very grateful to Yolande. She has practically organized the whole of our future for us. We are settled, fixed, planted</said><said direct=True>—yes, that's it—</said><said direct=False>we grow, ourselves, of course, but she has planted us in the right soil, with exactly the right aspect. Now our dear little characters can develop beautifully, and our hands keep pretty, and no wrinkles come in our nice, smooth foreheads. You've been a little I don't know what about Yolande. But you must own that what she undertakes she does well.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201337"><said direct=False>“Even to the red-branding of suspected fruit-thieves—yes.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201338"><said direct=False>Yolande was spending Christmas at the Red House, and, it being Christmas Eve, the tenant dined with us. We had a merry evening. We had lighted a huge fire in the big, empty drawing-room where the piano was; Chloe played waltzes, and Yolande danced with me and with the tenant. When the dancing was over Chloe and I sat by the fire and the others went out to look at the stars from the balcony.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201339"><said direct=True>“Ah, youth, youth!”</said><said direct=False> I sighed.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201340"><said direct=True>“They will catch their deaths of cold,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, prosaically.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201341"><said direct=False>I whispered: “Chloe, in a very short time those people will come through that French window with the announcement of their engagement on their lips. This is the tamest love-affair I have ever witnessed. Everything has gone far too smoothly. Yolande has fallen in love obviously, bluntly, without any of those fine shades and nice feelings which you will remember to have noted in other cases—our own, for instance. She has grown rather dull.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201342"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t talk so loud,” said Chloe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201343"><said direct=True>“As for him,”</said><said direct=False> I went on, “happiness exudes from him like—like turpentine from the pine-tree, or oil from the skin of the castor, or beaver.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201344"><said direct=True>“I suppose when we'</said><said direct=False>re old we shall never talk nonsense,” she said. “I almost think you're getting too old for it now. Castor, indeed!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201345"><said direct=True>“No, I'</said><said direct=False>m not. Yes, we shall. We shall never grow old, because we shall always talk nonsense. Don't you think it would be nice and kind and thoughtful of us to go up to the loafery and leave them this room? I know she'll have an awful cold if she stays out there much longer. It's a terrible thing to celebrate your betrothal by a cold in the head.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201346"><said direct=False>So we spoke out into the starlit twilight of the balcony, and begged to be excused, and then we crept up-stairs and raked together the red embers of our loafery fire, and put logs on and crouched happily in low chairs on the hearthrug of our very own fire. Chloe knitted and I smoked happily and quietly till it seemed that we must no longer delay to go down and speed our parting tenant. It was, in fact, eleven o'clock. I was just knocking out my pipe on the hob when a light tap on the door mingled with my own tapping, and Yolande's face looked round the door.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201347"><said direct=True>“Come in!”</said><said direct=False> we said, “come in!” But we wondered, because Yolande had never, since the day when in our pride we first showed it to her, crossed the threshold of that room. Now she came in and closed the door softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201348"><said direct=True>“He'</said><said direct=False>s gone,” she said. “He asked me to say good-night to you for him.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201349"><said direct=False>She came across the room and sat down on the hearth-rug at Chloe's feet. She leaned her arm on Chloe's knee and laid her face upon the arm.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201350"><said direct=True>“This is the room of all rooms for confidences,”</said><said direct=False> she said, after a silence. “That's why I thought I might come in just this once. I've got something to tell you—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201351"><said direct=False>Chloe and I successfully avoided each other's eyes.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201352"><said direct=False>Another silence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201353"><said direct=True>“Shall I go away?”</said><said direct=False> I said, clumsily.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201354"><said direct=True>“Don'</said><said direct=False>t be silly,” she said. “It's nothing so very important, after all. Only I am afraid it will surprise you a little. I am rather surprised myself. As a matter of fact, I had never been so surprised in my life. It was not at all what I expected myself to do. What do you think I am going to be idiot enough to do?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201355"><said direct=False>We said, with as good an appearance of perfect ignorance as we could command, that we were sure we did not know.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201356"><said direct=True>“I'</said><said direct=False>m going to be married,” she said. “There!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201357"><said direct=False>It was difficult to express congratulatory surprise—so difficult that we failed utterly. Chloe threw her arms round Yolande's neck and began to laugh softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201358"><said direct=True>“You dear, silly, clever, blind, darling mole,”</said><said direct=False> she said. “Did you really think we were quite blind too—Len and I, who love you? My dear, we've known it from the very first, almost, and long before you did, I expect.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201359"><said direct=True>“Known what?”</said><said direct=False> said Yolande, in a suddenly changed voice; but she returned Chloe's kisses.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201360"><said direct=True>“Why, everything, my pretty, clever, foolish child,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe. “We've been watching over you and loving you all the time, like two old birds with a young one who is just learning to fly.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201361"><said direct=True>“Oh, you have, have you?”</said><said direct=False> said Miss Riseborough, softly.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201362"><said direct=True>“Yolande, you don'</said><said direct=False>t mind our being glad, and saying so? It's all been so beautifully simple and straightforward and idyllic; none of those horrible romantic complications that one expects from a Girton girl's love-affairs.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201363"><said direct=True>“Oh, it has, has it?”</said><said direct=False> Yolande's voice was softer than ever. I felt in my bones that for some reason Chloe's gentle enthusiasm did not please.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201364"><said direct=True>“I will go and put up the shutters,”</said><said direct=False> I said, for I felt that I was out of place in this confidence.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201365"><said direct=True>“No, don'</said><said direct=False>t,” said Yolande, with a curious stiffness in her voice. “Do you really mean, Chloe, that you have been imagining that—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201366"><said direct=True>“That the tenant worshipped the ground under your pretty feet?”</said><said direct=False> said my wife. “Well, yes.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201367"><said direct=True>“You are strangely mistaken,”</said><said direct=False> Yolande said, very deliberately. “I am going to marry a man you have never seen.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201368"><said direct=False>“Yolande!”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201369"><said direct=True>“Then I must offer you more formal and less well-informed congratulations,”</said><said direct=False> said I. “What is his name?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201370"><said direct=False>There was a slight pause.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201371"><said direct=True>“Percival Forbes,”</said><said direct=False> she said.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201372"><said direct=False>Our tenant's name was something quite different. A silence followed that none of us knew how to break. Chloe spoke first.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201373"><said direct=True>“My dear girl, how annoying you must have thought us. I am so sorry. I wish I hadn'</said><said direct=False>t said—I don't know what it was I did say.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201374"><said direct=True>“It'</said><said direct=False>s all right,” said Yolande, in an odd, stifled voice; “but really, if you want romance—”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201375"><said direct=True>“Yolande, I don'</said><said direct=False>t understand you to-night.” Chloe was making horseshoes in her forehead. “Tell us what you wish to tell us. I am afraid of you. I don't like to ask you anything.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201376"><said direct=True>“Why should you, when it'</said><said direct=False>s so beautifully tame and idyllic? But I'll tell you a story if you like.”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201377"><said direct=False>Chloe stroked her hair timidly, and I, in sheer embarrassment, refilled my pipe.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201378"><said direct=True>“Imagine a young woman, tolerably well educated and very cocksure about everything. She meets a man, and they like each other. Then they quarrel—oh, never mind what about—and the man goes to India, and she is very sorry. And then he writes that he is coming back, and will she see him on Christmas Day? And she says yes—and to-morrow is Christmas Day. And all this time they'</said><said direct=False>ve both been perfectly miserable. Is that more romantic—and involved?”</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201379"><said direct=True>“Much,”</said><said direct=False> said Chloe, with conviction.</said></p>
<p n="ENG190201380"><said direct=True>“But I don'</said><said direct=False>t like it so well, Yolande,” I said, “because there is more to the story. May I hit out straight from the shoulder?—as you said to Chloe once. Do you remember?”</said></p>
